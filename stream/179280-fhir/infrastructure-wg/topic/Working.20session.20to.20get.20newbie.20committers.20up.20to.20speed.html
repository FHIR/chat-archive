<p>At the WGM last week, we talked about having a session where experienced folks would some people new to the committing process through getting the build working locally, so we'd be able to usefully volunteer to get down the list of outstanding trackers to be applied.  When are we planning to do that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is "$(pwd):" something I copy and past</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You copy and paste. It's a syntax that the shell resolves as "run the <code>pwd</code> command and insert its output here", which is to say: <code>$(pwd)</code> will resolve to the full path of the folder you're in when you run the docker command (i.e., wherever you cloned the fhir spec to).</p>

<li>Jeckyl (latest Ruby and latest Jeckyl for Ubuntu LTS 20.04)</li>
<li>12 GB memory</li>

<p>That was the first gradle-based build. After running <a href="http://clean.sh">clean.sh</a>, the second build took 31 min.<br>
What I noticed was that the validation of each artifact (resource, or example) took at least one second each.  Maybe that is one place where the build can be sped up.</p>

<p>Docker is useful if there are specific environment requirements as it allows setting them up in a clean environment. This allows for checking those requirements each time the container is run and shields the local system from this specific requirements. E.g. in the example provided by Josh, running the IG builder requires sushi, python, graphiz, jekyll, asciidoc,... In such situation, a Dockerized build as a lot of advantages. It also makes it easy to run build jobs on different computers. </p>
<p>In the case of the FHIR build, the only remaining environment requirement seams to be a recent Java SDK. Although it is perfectly feasible running the build in Docker. I think taking the Docker approach in this situation might be a little bit overkill. <br>
It could still be useful if one wants to offload the build to a different machine. We can provide a script/Dockerfile for this but I think this is less critical.</p>

<p>100% agree. Docker is not a solution I'm trying to push on anyone or "sell" this community on. It's just something I use already in the auto build pipeline and in my own development, and for folks who want it, it's available.</p>

<p>well, you're welcome to dive into the validation code and find speed improvements. But the low hanging fruit was picked a long time ago</p>

<p>The slowdown must have been due to either that I was running it on VMWare VM, or that I didn't give enough memory to Java.<br>
I ran a new clone directly on a 4-core Intel laptop with 16GB memory, SSD, Linux with _JAVA_OPTIONS=-Xmx15000m (note the leading underscore) - 17 minutes</p>

<p>Somewhat related, if you are planning on working on the core spec, it is probably a good idea to subscribe to <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179165" href="/#narrow/stream/179165-committers">#committers</a> .

<p>Somewhat related to <em>that</em>, if you are pushing builds you can subscribe to <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179297" href="/#narrow/stream/179297-committers.2Fnotification">#committers/notification</a> to see the results of builds in Zulip  =).</p>
