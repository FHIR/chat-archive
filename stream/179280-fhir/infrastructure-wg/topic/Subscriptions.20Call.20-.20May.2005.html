<p>Hi all, wanted to post notice that we plan to perform 'official' work on the next Subscriptions call (May 5).  We will be working through Jira tickets based on <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/issues/?filter=13929">this filter</a>, which should contain non-applied tickets from the backport ballot.</p>
<p>I will continue working on proposed dispositions until the meeting in order to make the best use of time.  If anyone has a ticket they want promoted or removed, please let me know.  Additionally, if there are any questions or comments, please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
