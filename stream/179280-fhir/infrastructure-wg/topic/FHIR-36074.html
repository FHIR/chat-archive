<p>Regarding the PA/FHIR-I clashing ticket<br>
<a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-36074">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-36074</a><br>
PA has commented on this and marked it as a duplicate - as the issue itself was exactly the same as a whole list of other trackers which have been approved and will be applied in the next week.<br>
There does remain an outstanding issue of the other change to ConnectionType - specifically changing from Coding to CodeableConcept, and making the field optional. (the upper cardinality change on this has also been approved in another tracker also)<br>
As that change had nothing to do with the original request of the tracker, PA would like someone to create a new issue specifically for this issue, along with the reasoning/use cases on having no connection type value, and what that would mean.<br>
(these notes are also in the tracker above which is marked as duplicate)</p>
