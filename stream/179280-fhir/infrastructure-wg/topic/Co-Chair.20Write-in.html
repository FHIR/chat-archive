<p>Hello everyone:<br>
Since Ewout Kramer decided not to run re-election, I would like to put my name into the hat of write-in candidates.<br>
Here is my brief resume:  I have participated FHIR-I WG meeting since 2013. I have learned a lot of FHIR during the last six years. My FHIR-I involvement helped me to be the first to pass FHIR Proficiency Certification. Other than FHIR-I WG, I also outreached to CDS, Pharmacy, and Vocabulary Work Groups. Outside HL7 community, I have worked at both private sector and public sector. As a co-chair, I will continue current work group's agenda, and serving FHIR activities in other work groups. Thank you for voting for me.</p>
