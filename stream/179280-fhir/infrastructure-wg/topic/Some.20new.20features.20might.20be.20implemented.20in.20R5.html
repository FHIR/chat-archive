<p>1 . The security label can be applied to the elements’ layer rather than resources.<br>
For example, the consent of the owner of the health information only applies to the part of the CONDITION resource instead of the entire resource.<br>
2.  A separate triage tag can be specified out of the meta.tags for priority and time sensitivity of patient safety resource information. This triage tag can enable the system to push the information to the registered endpoints instead of waiting for the pull.<br>
3.  A guideline should provide suggestions on the number of reference layers to leverage smooth message exchanges without triggering a storm.</p>

<p>If you want to label individual data elements, you'll need an extension.  However, in practice, managing filtering at a data element level is very difficult (e.g. consider narrative).  So be <em>very</em> sure you want to go down this path.  And don't expect it to be widely supported.</p>

<p>As suggested, I have created two FHIR tickets on the JIRA.<br>
1.  To provide a triage tag for each event resource with ticket number <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-36743">FHIR-36743</a><br>
2.  To provide a best-practice guide on the reference hop limit in use-case implementations with ticket number  <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-36744">FHIR-36744</a></p>
<p>Please take a look and provide your valuable comments.</p>

<p>Thanks for these submission! Reading through the two Jira issues, I'm concerned that it's not entirely clear what changes you are asking for. Any chance you can update these issues with specific proposed changes to the language or content in the FHIR spec? e.g., "On this page of the spec, in this section, I would like to make the following changes..." -- this kind of specificity makes it much more likely that the FHIR Infrastructure Workgroup will be able to give your ideas full consideration.</p>
