<p>This really is a teaser to the bigger question what can FHIR messaging do that REST + subscriptions can't do.  We are getting hammered on this in the notifications IG and since that IG very closely and carefully follows the core specification, I think it is appropriate to answer some of these questions here.</p>

<p>throwing Jenni under the bus... " I think most of the arguments I hear of subscription over message is more: Messaging feels like a way we "ported" V2 style communication into the FHIR world - in which case we aren't gaining much. We already have V2 capabilities that can be used if you want messaging style interaction :) Subscriptions is better for more web/restful common patterns that FHIR has been very successful with."  Which begs the question "whither FHIR messaging?.." and I don't see a suitable non hand wavy answer.</p>

<p>Messaging makes sense when you need routing and when query/polling isn't reasonable due to architectural or business/regulatory reasons.

<p>part of the message header is the things you need to make routing manageable. You can always route any push message (eg http proxies) but typically people mean interface engines, and message header includes things like intended destination endpoint and person that make this much more manageable</p>

<p>Actually, interface engines make it possible not to care what the intended destination point is - the rules in the engine determine where the message goes (including multiple destinations). <br>
I general, I believe there is a need to start describing in more detail the different uses of messaging. Some thoughts in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>There isn't a hard distinction between  subscriptions and messaging, there is a spectrum. </li>
<li>I think one of the issues with FHIR messaging is that it cannot fuel the "app economy" (if you sense a hint of sarcasm, you are not necessarily wrong).</li>
<li>As far as I understand, currently the only safe assumption to make, when you receive a message, is that the resources within are ephemeral, and they should be thrown away. This, I believe, causes an architectural friction between the REST-based parts, and  FHIR messaging.</li>
<li>If we take the Da Vinci Alerts IG as an example, there are two ways to look at the purpose of a notification. <ul>
<li>One is that the event described in the notification is recorded in the receiving system, and that is as far as it goes. If that is the case, then indeed, why not use an HL7 V2 ADT message, send it over HTTPS, and be done with it? I believe it is trivial for most existing engines to add an additional destination for hospital admits that they already manage anyway. If the recipient needs the data in FHIR format, the V2-to-FHIR project will likely lead to several transformation tools to be employed for this purpose.</li>
<li>The other purpose of a notification is to be the starting point of additional data exchange, e.g. queries from the recipient of the notification to the sender of the notification  for additional information. If that's the case, FHIR messaging for the notification part doesn't give you what you want, because there is no guarantee that the information in the message is queryable. If the IG adds the stipulation that the resources in the message need to be accessible via REST by the recipient, only then you can be certain that the subsequent steps of the data exchange can occur. And if you go that far, then why go through the trouble of messaging, when subscription will work and scale better?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe we need to use some of the workflow calls on this...</p>

<p>A bit late to this party, but Subscriptions does define what is sent (e.g., MIME type, empty/id/resource, etc.).  Due to feedback, the current version has  been limited to a single resource, but it has been discussed to allow graphs, etc. (Primary concerns are around security - trying to evaluate a graph without a logged-in user)</p>

<p>I think there is some variety behind "no choice" that is worth investigating and providing at least some guidance for IG authors.</p>
<p>On a related note, I am somewhat surprised that the MessageHeader resource is at FMM 4. It's the resource  which is at the core of the whole messaging paradigm, and I feel like we are just now getting into that area.</p>

<p>I guess I was waiting to pounce after the first version of SS was penned.  I think the whole routing thing may be legit for sub status.  Second the idea of a focus is akin to the topic  On the other hand, making a hybrid MH + SS would have elements that would make no sense for one vs the other which might be more trouble than it is worth.   ( Maybe a baby step to merging would be to call it 'SubscriptionHeader' ;-) )</p>

<p>I think there needs to be a page similar to Messaging, and both <code>documentation</code> and the subscription-relevant resources will point to it. Since it can't be called <code>Subscription</code> (that's the name of the resource), maybe call it <code>SubscriptionFramework</code>?</p>

<p>I am having a hard time figuring out what exactly was approved in  <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-25928" title="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-25928">FHIR#25928</a>. It just points to this Zulip topic. Is it any different from what I posted? Or is it just your way of telling me "just get on with making these changes happen" <span aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes" class="emoji emoji-1f601" role="img" title="grinning face with smiling eyes">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span></p>

<p>Yes, that is the Issue I was working through at the time (I'm reviewing every issue with the word 'subscription' in it right now).  There's approval for adding "something" to the "Exchanging Resources" section - I posted the question while trying to figure out what that "something" should look like (the Jira page is decidedly thin on details).</p>
<p>Since there was only a resource page, it has both the general/conceptual and the specific/concrete details together.  Splitting them will be somewhat non-trivial (separation of concerns, repeated info, etc.) and I wanted to make sure I was on the right track before starting.</p>
<p>I won't start that piece until tomorrow, so if there are other opinions I'd like to hear them.  But I feel good in that Vassil's thoughts align with mine, so I'm happy to take a stab at it as is.</p>

<p>FHIR-I is grossly behind at applying approved CR, and often the CR doesn't indicate what will be changed. This is very concerning governance problem.</p>

<p>note, that I was willing to apply some... but  I looked at the jira ticket and can't tell what I should do. As you can see above in this thread.</p>

<p>I think if the ticket isn't clear, it makes sense to ask rather than doing nothing.</p>
<p>When tackling issues, I typically check in on Zulip before starting anyway, then ask for review after a cut is done.</p>

<p>Also, feel free to cherry-pick and work on the ones where the change is straight-forward/clear.  Every little bit helps...</p>
