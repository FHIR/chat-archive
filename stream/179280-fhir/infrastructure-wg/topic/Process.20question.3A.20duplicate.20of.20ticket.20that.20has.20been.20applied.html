<p>Hi all, process question.  Was working through tickets and found that <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32770">FHIR#32770</a> is a duplicate of <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30374">FHIR#30374</a> , which was already voted on, and I happened to have applied before seeing the (newer) duplicate.</p>
<p>Since the ticket is applied, I cannot mark the new one as duplicate.  I <em>assume</em> that I should propose a disposition and reference the other ticket, but wanted to check before I went ahead and made any changes.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
