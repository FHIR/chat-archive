<p>Although we didn't have time to vote on Block Vote #3 yesterday, the Shorthand team is ready with proposed Block Vote #4.  This represents the last installment of FSH ballot comments.  As usual, if you would like to pull any issues out of the block, please reply in this stream. Hopefully we can get to BV#3 on July 6 and take up BV#4 either the same time or the following week, July 13. <a href="/user_uploads/10155/69UVPxv0p61uvhYKEJzSs4Cf/FSH-Block-Vote-4-Proposed-6-29-2020.xlsx">FSH-Block-Vote-4-Proposed-6-29-2020.xlsx</a></p>
