<p>Please take note of the enclosed spreadsheet with a proposed block vote #2 for FHIR Shorthand. These are beefier issues than those in block vote #1.  I will follow this with a date for discussion and vote. As usual, let me know here if you want to remove any issues for individual discussion. <a href="/user_uploads/10155/86KvgJjkzqB8Ttd6k6a-7v4b/FSH-Block-Vote-2-Proposed-6-11-2020.xlsx">FSH-Block-Vote-2-Proposed-6-11-2020.xlsx</a></p>

<p>The next FHIR-I is 6/22.  I feel like proposing two block votes is a lot, however, you have all seen block #1 before, and it is composed of minor, easy-to-resolve issues. Assuming block #1 doesn't take much time, the real focus will be on block #2.</p>
