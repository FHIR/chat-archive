<p>On the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=76153089#FHIRWGMAgendas202001-ThurQ3" target="_blank" title="https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=76153089#FHIRWGMAgendas202001-ThurQ3">FHIR agenda for Thursday Q3</a>, a Security meeting is listed with "FHIR-I will not be joining."  Is this on the agenda because there's something FHIR-related that needs to be discussed but FHIR-I doesn't have anyone to attend?</p>

<p>I won't be able to attend that slot either, as I am giving the Security and Privacy Tutorial Thursday afternoon. So it is not clear what discussion can happen during that joint. Security WG is hosing FHIR discussions all day today, although we didn't request joint with FHIR-I so don't have assistance.</p>

<p>I informed the security co-chairs that FHIR-I couldn't make that slot due to a limited number of co-chairs and invited them to re-schedule in one of the slots where we did have availability.  They never responded.  If you're free and want to touch base with them <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191936">@Michael Donnelly</span>, you're welcome to...</p>
