<p>Hi all!  I know this isn't normally posted, but there has been a lot of restructuring applied to the Subscription R4 side and I wanted to give people a chance to review.  For anyone not following closely, there are now to additional resources in R4B: <a href="http://build.fhir.org/branches/R4B/subscriptiontopic.html">SubscriptionTopic</a> and <a href="http://build.fhir.org/branches/R4B/subscriptionstatus.html">SubscriptionStatus</a>.  With the new resources, the <a href="https://argonautproject.github.io/subscription-backport-ig/">Backport IG</a> (note: currently on <a href="http://github.io">github.io</a>, because of build dependencies) has been refactored quite a bit - e.g., many things that were in the IG are now in the core spec.</p>
<p>Other recent changes of note are the resolutions to some long-open questions, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>SubscriptionTopic has a way to use event triggers (in addition to the previous resource-based triggers)</li>
<li>SubscriptionTopic includes a <code>notificationShape</code> backbone element, which describes related resources that MAY be included with notifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll be focusing on this at the Connectathon, but I know that many people interested in this are committed to other tracks.  Cheers!</p>
