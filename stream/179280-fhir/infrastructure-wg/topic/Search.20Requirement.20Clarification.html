<p>Quick question on requirements for search.  There has been a fair bit of discussion on <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>, which landed on text indicating that servers SHALL support both HTTP verbs, but MAY respond with a <code>405</code> to one of them (e.g., <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-31943">FHIR-31943</a>).</p>
<p>It is not qualified anywhere today, but I <em>assume</em> that should only apply to where a server actually supports search, right?  E.g., a server can still be fully compliant even if they support NO search at all, by not advertising support for it.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I thought that was already clear as the requirement was on the search page.</p>

<p>Hmm.. I can't find anything there - the only Search Conformance / Capability mentions I can find are related to search parameter advertisement.</p>
<p>In a broader look, there is an implication on the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/http.html#search">http page</a> - <code>servers *that* support search SHALL also...</code> (text needs to be updated per those tickets still, emphasis mine), and there is probably something that can be constructed via <code>CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.interaction</code> and <code>CapabilityStatement.messaging.supportedMessage</code> rules.</p>
<p>I was hoping that I was skipping over it (if anyone has a link to it, that would be nice =), but I am a bit less confident of that now.  Next best is my hope that <em>adding</em> fluffy text about it to the search page is "harmless text" and doesn't require YAT (yet another ticket), but am not too confident about that either  :-/.</p>

<p>It's a normative page and it doesn't meet the criteria for technical correction (spelling/grammar/formatting/link), so I'm afraid it's a YAT scenario.  But it should be a non-controversial ticket and you're fine to pre-apply.</p>
