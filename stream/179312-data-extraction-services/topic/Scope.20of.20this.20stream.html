<p>Hello all, <br>
this is the stream for discussing all topics related to data extraction services, such as text analysis, NLP, image recognition etc. <br>
The topics discussed should not touch on the actual algorithms used but rather on how to represent the results from these analysis in FHIR.</p>
<p>Some talking points for further discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>how do we express confidentiality in the results?</li>
<li>how do we reference specifics elements in resurces that have been created</li>
<li>how do we capture character or byte ranges to be able to trace back from what parts of the source data?</li>
<li>can we use this  range to highlight parts of the source data for human inspection?</li>
<li>how can we capture confirmation/dismissal of detected information in a review process?</li>
<li>how different are the requirements for text/audio/picture analysis?<br>
bonus question: can we use all of this information to feed training data back to improve AI algorithms?</li>
</ul>

<p>Summary of the talking points from the DevDays BoF that started this stream:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is agreed that Provenance should be the container for any additional information about data extraction results. </li>
<li>Provanance.target points at the created resource (e.g. Condition, Observation, MedicationStatement...) </li>
<li>Provenance.agent gives details about the algorithm that extracted the data (Software name, Vendor, Version...)</li>
<li>
<p>Provenance.entity gives details about the source of the data (like a PDF, an audio file, a picture...)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we require a (complex) extension to capture confidence, character/byte range, andntarget element</p>
</li>
<li>it is not yet clear how confidence can be expressed in an interoperable way, but the way it's handled in the Patient/$match operation definition might be a starting point.</li>
<li>in addition to keeping the confidence on the (immutable) Provenance resource, the created resources should also have a status that reflects uncertainty (e.g. "unconfirmed") and may have an additional Metadata tag to indicate that these resources e.g. "need revision/confirmation"). If the resources are subsequently confirmed or rejected, that will update the tags/status, but not alter the Provenance.</li>
<li>the range part of the extension should be suitable to be able to show/highlight the parts of the original source that led to the creation of a resource</li>
</ul>
<p>Please create individual chat topics to further discuss any of the above mentioned issues...</p>
