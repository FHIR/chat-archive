<p>Hi all, <br>
for expressing the character range (=text span) of a text mining annotation within a fhir Provenance resource, we (mainly @Kai Heitmann and @Simone Heckmann) suggest the following format:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&quot;extension&quot;: [
    {
        &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://fhir.de/StructureDefinition/character-range/0.5&quot;,
        &quot;valueRange&quot;: [
            {
                &quot;low&quot;: {&quot;value&quot;: 12},
                &quot;high&quot;: {&quot;value&quot;: 24}
            }
        ]
    }
]
</pre></div>

<p>Might it be an idea to include an optional field (<code>snippet</code>, <code>context</code> or similar) for providing the range of text (with a buffer on either side) from which the concept in question was extracted? E.g if the generated resource is a <code>Condition</code> stating that the patient has pneumonia, one might have something like this inside the extension on the corresponding <code>Provenance</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>...
context: &quot;(...)completed. It seems the patient suffers from pneumonia. This could(...)&quot;
...
</pre></div>


<p>I will defer to NLP pros to say whether this is useful and feasible, but it might worth considering for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. It would give a (human) user the chance to evaluate how trustworthy the extraction is without retrieving further resources, opening documents etc.<br>
2. It could be useful in contexts where it may be difficult to identify the correct text range if the text in question is not in a plain text file (this came up during the NLP session at the DevDays). E.g. It may be a PDF produced from a scan on which OCR was run and if the PDF includes company logos with text etc. it may be hard to tell exactly which character is number 234.</p>

<p>I'd like to revisit this discussion: why not using a commonly used format like <a href="http://2011.bionlp-st.org/home/file-formats" target="_blank" title="http://2011.bionlp-st.org/home/file-formats">http://2011.bionlp-st.org/home/file-formats</a> and transform this into a FHIR class like structure? For text annotations it has the information as Philipp suggested and it also contains the actual context.</p>

<p>beyond that... in Provenance we have only addressed using reference to point at a whole resource. So, can't really help on trying to point at specific locations within a narrative. That seems well beyond core need.</p>

<p>The CR you mentioned adresses referencing specific elements in the <em>target</em> resource, whereas the extension above connects the target to a snippet from the <em>source</em> which led to the creation of the target. They have both different scopes but they can work perfectly well in combination, e.g. to express that Condition.code has been created from the snipped "...suffers from Type II Diabetes...", while Condition.onsetDateTime was created from the snippet "...diagnosed in December 2016...".</p>
<p>So, what you're saying is that the extensions should go into an Implementation guide rather than in core extensions?<br>
BTW: I'm definitely <strong>not</strong> arguing to make them core <em>elements</em>!</p>

<p>something that starts in an implementation guide can migrate into the core as it proves useful to a broader community. More importantly, I think this kind of functionality likely needs lots of explanation which is easier to do in an IG.  I am not outright rejecting it, I am not that powerful anyway.. just asserting that it feels to me as not core.</p>

<p>I cannot help feeling like there is some force fitting here.  While a Range does have 2 quantitative values, I don't think that it is a good fit for text character indices.  A Range defines upper and lower bounds, within which some value should exist.  This does not fit text character indices, which are absolute and not simply within some range.  In addition, Range uses the General Purpose Datatype SimpleQuantity.  This is not ideal for text character indices, which are always of Primitive Type  unsignedInt.  In my view, Range is not exact enough to be used for character indices.   In addition, consider the Rule for Range: "If present, low SHALL have a lower value than high."   That doesn't work for a single-character token, for which indices are not a vector.</p>
