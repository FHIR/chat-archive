<p>What is the current set of testing in Touchstone around the Observation.effective[x] element? Of interest to me is:<br>
a) Variations on effectiveDateTime -- precision, timezone presence, offset presence<br>
b) use of effectivePeriod<br>
c) rather the use of effectiveTIming, and effectiveInstant</p>
<p>I ask as am seeing most US-Core data using just effectiveDateTime... and having high variability on the (a) front. So wondered to what extent that touchstone has the ability to cover the possibilities of variation... I presume that Touchstone has a library of testing capability in this space? Especially given the staff expertise in dateTime query knowledge.</p>
<p>and thus wondering if there is a sample data (e.g. synthetic) that covers this full range.</p>

<p>Currently we don't do any specific testing around Observation.effective[x] and our US Core tests are currently only covering v3.1.1 while we look at updating them to cover US Core v4.0.0 so we haven't done any testing around Timing or Instant just yet.<br>
Also we don't do much reporting on how testers are using any specific element, and what we do track is mostly trends of if people are passing or failing asserts so if there aren't asserts for a specific piece we may not take note.<br>
As for effectiveDateTime we recently noticed that vs-1 and us-core-1 are not functioning correctly in any version of base FHIR or US Core so we will going forward correct that and confirm that all Observation.effectiveDateTimes validated against a us core profile or the vital-signs profile have at precision at least down to the date. <br>
As for timezone presence and offset presence, the validation will catch any DateTime elements that were precise to time but without a timezone, per the spec's definition of DateTime. But since there are no further restrictions besides the regex definition on which timezones/offsets are available to my knowledge we likely won't have any specific checks against that.</p>
