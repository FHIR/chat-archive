<p>Is there a Draft STU for Drug Formulary to make it patient specific. is this something that is happening? Would that be in Pharmacy WG?</p>
<p>I also understood on our meeting the other day that there is overlap with other Da Vinci patient specific profiles or IGs where maybe this formulary information would also be returned and making Drug Formulary redundant to a patient specific scenario?</p>
<p>I also was thinking about the Use Cases you presented <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="222957">@Dave Hill</span>  listed, through out of scope, you say patients may pull meds form EHR and then look them up. Could they also pull meds from their payer(s) and do the same?</p>
