<p>Working on the CMS <a href="https://dpc.cms.gov/">Data at the Point of Care (DPC)</a> API.  Currently, users who consume this API are required to attest that they have a legitimate purpose and/or relationship for pulling data for the given patient.  An existing historical claim between patient and provider is one way to establish the relationship, but doesn't cover other use cases such as a first time visit.  The current DPC design requires the user to submit a Provenance resource in the header of the request.  This approach may very well be adequate as it does seem to roughly follow this <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pdex/2019Jun/6-7_Handling_Data_Provenance.html#6-7-1-example-provenance-record-for-chain-of-custody">DaVinci PDex guidance</a>.   Still, CMS has asked us to ensure that we're in alignment with industry best practices and to look for guidance from other groups who have worked on a similar use case.  We're looking at DaVinci PDex,HRex and ATR which are helpful but cover a lot of ground and use cases.  Wondering if anyone can point us at specific areas within DaVinci IGs and/or provide guidance for this use case.  Thanks!!</p>
