<p>We are currently planning for CMS 9123 rule and have some questions regarding members opting-in to Payer-to-Payer during enrollment. From the prior ruling that was pulled back: impacted payers must create a process to allow members to opt-in to permit the payer to use the Payer-to-Payer API for bulk access with other payers at enrollment and quarterly with concurrent payers as described below.<br>
1) If a member does not provide consent at enrollment how are payers handling this? Are procedures being put in place for post-enrollment capture?<br>
2) Are any payers leveraging pre-enrollment systems to handle consent? It seems this ruling would change some of our enrollment forms if we end up touching the pre-enrollment process which would be a large effort.<br>
3) Once a member grants consent at enrollment how long is it valid? Will other payers proactively ask members if they have concurrent plans? How often?<br>
4) If a member revokes consent are payers removing the "other payer" data or just stopping the transition of data going forward?</p>
