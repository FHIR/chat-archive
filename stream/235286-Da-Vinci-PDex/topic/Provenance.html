<p>Hi everyone. I'm trying to parse the PDEX <code>SHALL</code> requirements related to Provenance (as a payer implementing the IG).</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the <code>searchRevInclude</code> interaction, is the expectation that a client application should be able to query a bundle/resource and then return to the FHIR server <em>n</em> days later and get the provenance for that bundle/resource using the bundle/resource reference?</li>
<li>The timestamp that's captured in the <code>recorded</code> field  should always be the Date/Time that the payer received the information or created the bundle -- is that correct?</li>
</ul>

<p>typically the Provenance.occured[x] would be when the activity the Provenance describes happened. The Provenance.recorded is when the Provenance record was created. Most of the time they are the same, but there is no requirement they are the same.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> So when we're dealing with a transmitter provenance record, would Provenance.recorded still be when the record was received/created by the payer? (As opposed to the timestamp of the response to a specific app's API call?)</p>

<p>I think you are now asking a question that only a developed and deployed system could answer. My answer is about the intent of the Provenance resource core FHIR resource definition.</p>

<p>Hmm, okay. So in the context of the Patient Access API, is the intent of the "transmitter" Provenance scenario to<br>
1) create effectively an audit log in the FHIR server of each time an app requested and received a resource? <br>
OR<br>
2) capture that the payer is acting as a transmitter for a resource that they received at x time, and be able to pass that context on to any app that requests that resource?</p>

<p>Hi folks. We're reviewing the Provenance requirements, and we were thrown off by the cardinality for author and transmitter here. Wouldn't we want Author to be 0..1 and Transmitter to be 0..*? I would expect a record to have one author but multiple transmitters over time. <a href="/user_uploads/10155/_bEdvVV5-0M1fJUO7PSYAyLD/image.png">image.png</a></p>
