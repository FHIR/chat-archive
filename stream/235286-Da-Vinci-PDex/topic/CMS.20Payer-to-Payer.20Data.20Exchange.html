<p>When you really start to go into detail on implementing this - we feel there are a lot of challenges and ambiguity. Would love to talk with someone who has implemented this in real-world - anyone?</p>

<p>Hi team,</p>
<p>Following are some concerns that we have in discussion</p>
<p>If we consider data sharing, In FHIR perspective there are multiple ways to share data between payers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Via member mediated SMART-on-FHIR Application : For this approach, everything is fine until you hit the jackpot that the member needs is an account that works in the old payer portal. That is hard to come by, when you try to load records from a very old health plan because it is reasonable even in payer perspective to disable the account.</li>
</ol>
<p>[Possible solutions to consider: 1. CMS rule to mandate member login in read-only mode for a time period which the payer needs to maintain records. 2. Impose and Introduce temporary account activation (read-only) mechanism]</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Payer push / pull - in this method upon member request (or without) new payer can pull or old payer can push records. Record pull case works fine. But in the push case there is no defined endpoint where the old payer can push data.</li>
</ol>
<p>[Possible solutions to consider: Introduce bulk data import operation so old payer can perform member-match and do bulk data import or POST support for patient-everything]</p>
<p>Even with all above approaches, it won’t really solve interoperability among payers unless those aspects are at least added to an IG and best it is best if mandate in CMS rule. </p>
<p>I personally think the rule or IG should be strict on communication and data sharing protocol at first so all payers  follow the same. That will even reduce organizational overhead that payers must face with manual workflows etc. when usage rises.</p>

<p>Milinda / Nirmal. The PDex IG specifically documented the Member-Match operation to enable Payers to perform an. exchange WITHOUT a member requiring an active account at their prior payer. </p>
<p>In PDex we reference the HRex IG which has been updated to document an authorization with consent process that further refines this member-match process. We will be testing this interaction at the Connectathon.</p>

That is hard to come by, when you try to load records from a very old health plan because it is reasonable even in payer perspective to disable the account."     I have not seen or heard of health plan portal accounts being 'disabled' by the health plan. If a member selects 'create new account' so they can access their information during the time they were eligible, the portal will allow you to do that. Have you seen a production example of where a health plan refuses to allow you to create a new account to view your claim information while you were a member even though you are no longer enrolled?</p>

<p>I'm sure this is covered somewhere, or maybe it's self evident. <br>
Are there any guidelines on <em>how</em> a member initiates the payer-to-payer exchange? <br>
Is it the expectation that it would be an option in the payer's web portal for a member to request data from a previous payer? Are there other required or common means to initiate the exchange?</p>
