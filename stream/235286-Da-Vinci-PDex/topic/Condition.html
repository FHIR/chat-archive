Hi - For Patient Access API Clinical Data- We are loading Conditions which were identified during Authorization and Appeals for Utilization Management cases within Condition Resource. Clinical Status is a must have element and status of the patient is not recorded during UM case in our source systems. Can we provide a Data Absent reason for this Clinical Status Code?  Looking at the profile, it does not seem to be possible as its an required code and not extendible. Can you please suggest if we can ignore loading the Clinical Status altogether if its not available. Else can we load it as "active" during the period of authorization/Appeal ( loaded within Encounter profile) and when the encounter is over, we update it to "resolved"?</p>
