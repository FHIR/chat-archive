<p>The patient access implementation guides (US Core and CARIN BB) do not include the $everything operation, so my expectation would be that payer-to-payer exchanges via the patient access API would use standard FHIR searches and not $everything, am I wrong?</p>

<p>CARIN BB does not specify a $everything operation, although there have been discussions as to whether it should. CARIN BB was not included in the payer-to-payer transactions. It has element requirements for dollar amounts that would not be appropriate in a payer to payer interactions. The current expectation is procedure/diagnosis/encounter information would be supported via PDex.</p>

<p>I know that the CARIN BB data is different, but patient access API server and client would _not_ use $everything, correct?</p>

<p>So I'd expect the same to be true for payer-to-payer exchange that piggy-back on patient access API - would not make sense to use a completely different transfer system?</p>

<p>Yes, since $everything is not defined for this IG, there is no expectation that a server supporting this IG would support it. It is allowable for servers to define their own operations of course or use operations in support of other IGs.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about this -- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>CARIN BB was not included in the payer-to-payer transactions. It has element requirements for <strong>dollar amounts that would not be appropriate in a payer to payer interactions</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, any patient-mediated data exchange likely will include the CMS regulated data for patient access, profiled by CARIN BB. The payer would be required to expose "dollar amounts" to any app of the patient's choosing, including an app of another payer. How would the old payer know when to expose PDex profiles instead of CARIN profiles to a PDex patient app?</p>

<p>Agree with what is being said here without choosing to speculate on future CMS requirements. </p>
<p>In the absence of future rule making by CMS, Humana is approving access to other payers who wish to connect with us via the Patient Access API technology. We will, however, be withholding scopes for patient/ExplanationOfBenefit.read as we are under no obligation to give claims history to our competitors. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, people aren't exposing PDex and CARIN profiles for the same resource... Not sure what was meant by that or if I read it wrong. </p>
<p>$everything operations can be used by payer FHIR servers but aren't required. Humana's FHIR server does support this feature. Based on the scopes you are given as a payer client to our servers, we would return everything except EOB data for a $everything operation.</p>

<p>If the individual has permission to see the data, they have permission to see the data.  Who owns the app doesn't matter.  If the patient asking for data via a payer app means that the payer sees financial data that the source payer doesn't want them to, I think (based on current regulations), the answer is "that's too bad for the source payer".  In theory, patients could band together and publish their EOBs (with financials) for the whole world to search and mine if they feel like it.  That said, I'm not an expert on the regulations.</p>

<p>We're really not talking about an individual here. A business is retrieving patient data in order to customize a quote (in theory) to the patient. No insurance company want's to disclose the confidential price structure they pay for services to competitors. So the fact of which company is "brokering" the exchange is important to the source payer. A patient access app where the data is being provided to a member (essentially directly), with little risk of it being used for competitive advantage is one thing. But providing bulk data to be mined for contract details to a competitor is different. This ties in with the other conversation of what data to expose in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179166" href="/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers">#implementers</a>. In order to comply with laws and business objectives there will need to be a layer that takes into account: Person doing the request, The patient that is the subject, The reason for the request, The intermediary, Consent filings. </p>
<p>While payers are obligated to share clinical data with other payers, they are not obligated to share business confidential data. So if a payer is not obligated they will not do so. And I don't think "how much was paid for service" will ever be categorized as clinical. What this means is that each payer, individually, will come up with a method that "authorizes" financial data exchange. Likely limited to when the intermediary is not know to be a competitor.</p>

<p>In terms of patient access, I don't think you're allowed to worry about who the intermediary is.  If the patient wants to use an app created by Elbonian Hackers R Us, they can.  If they want to use an app created by a rival payer, they can.  If it's <em>not</em> patient access, then the disclosing payer can determine what apps they trust and what data consumers they trust to allow sharing at all as well as what filters they want in place.</p>

<p>If the user is the patient, then I think by patient access, you need to give them everything - as they have the right to see everything, regardless of what tool they're using.  If the user is someone from a payer, then you filter what they're allowed to see.  You do that <em>regardless</em> of what scopes they ask for.  There's always been a requirement to filter beyond what the scopes allow.  The purpose of the scopes is to give the user control over what the system accesses.  It doesn't allow the user to decide what their own access rights are.</p>

<p>These IGs are not going to scale in the real world if they depend on everyone implementing bespoke human-interpreted rules for each IG that depend on the user, the app, the stated reason for access, any intermediaries involved, and the requested scopes.

<p>well, first there needs to be consistent policies that we could then work on. But each state has radically different rules, and many organizations further refine the rules.

<p>At best, scopes can define what resources to return.  Scopes don't (at the moment) allow redaction of data from instances.  And that's absolutely something that systems will need to be able to do.  And there will be certain situations where scopes aren't sufficient either.  If a requester provides a scope of "all lab results" and patient consent or organization policy says "lab results related to HIV testing and certain other sensitive tests can't be shared", then the server is obligated to do that additional filtering.  And they <em>can't</em> count on the client to specify some fancy scope that says "all lab results excluding the ones you consider sensitive".</p>

<p>The component that creates the auth token will have to pass along all information needed for the "data limiter" to make a decision about the subset of data that will be returned. Right now the only scope defined by HL7 is the broad (has access to X resources) and I believe smart says (has access to patient y). Every other data point that the data limiter needs to make decisions will have to be placed in the auth token (or looked up with data in token). And this will be custom coding between the token generator and the data holder. Is it up to HL7 (smart) to say, "this is how in the token authorization is provided to get HIV type observations." I don't think so, there are too many rules for various jurisdictions to cover (unless it's a general scope rules engine).</p>

<p>The auth token is not necessarily going to convey all the information needed by the data limiter - unless the auth server happens to be aware of all patient consents and all organization policies.  Even then, that's not going to help with stripping data elements.  Auth scopes don't have that granularity - and can't reasonably ever be expected to.</p>
