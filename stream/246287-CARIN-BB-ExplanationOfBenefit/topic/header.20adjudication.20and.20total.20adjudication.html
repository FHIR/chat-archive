<p>Kindly explain how different are these header adjudication and total adjudication since the slice adjudicationcategory has the same valueset</p>
<p>.adjudication.amount (populate only if item.adjudication is not available):  Eligible amount = submitted amount - the noncovered amount - discount.  The subscriber pays the member liability = deductible + coinsurance + copay + noncovered.  (part of the member liability may have already been paid to the provider as paidbypatient). The eligible amount - the member liability is the payment amount to the provider (paidtoprovider) or the subscriber (paidtopatient)</p>
<p>.total.amount:  Eligible amount = submitted amount - the noncovered amount - discount.  The subscriber pays the member liability = deductible + coinsurance + copay + noncovered.  (part of the member liability may have already been paid to the provider as paidbypatient). The eligible amount - the member liability is the payment amount to the provider (paidtoprovider) or the subscriber (paidtopatient)</p>
