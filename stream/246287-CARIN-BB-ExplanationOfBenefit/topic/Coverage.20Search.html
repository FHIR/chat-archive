<p>I am having difficulty understanding the requirement for Coverage to support "_include Coverage:payor" when Coverage does not have search parameters. Can someone please provide examples of what  "[parameter=value]"s should be used for GET [base]/Coverage?[parameter=value]&amp;_include=Coverage:payor? Thank you! <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192132">@Amol Vyas</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="243554">@Pat Taylor</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191529">@Corey Spears</span></p>

<p>The Capability Statement and FHIR Artifacts&gt;Search Parameters (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/searchparameters.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/searchparameters.html</a>) seem to align. But then I found additional search parameters here:<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/artifacts.html#behavior-search-parameters">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/artifacts.html#behavior-search-parameters</a> which looks like the required searches AND the _includes?</p>

<p>Sorry for a delayed response here. This is something I am still trying to unpack. It seems like it may be related to another issue of this IG regarding _include brought up here: <a href="#narrow/stream/204607-CARIN-IG.20for.20Blue.20Button.C2.AE/topic/_include.3A*">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/204607-CARIN-IG.20for.20Blue.20Button.C2.AE/topic/_include.3A*</a><br>
_include parameters are supposed to based on search parameters (thus the additional search parameters you found in an automatically generated portion of the IG). The CARIN BB IG did not include those search parameters in the CapabilityStatement. These search parameters are really not all that helpful in the context of the use case of the IG. The _includes were added as a matter of convenience for client applications so additional logic and API calls were not needed. This has caused a bit of an incongruence in the spec that we will look to fix in STU2.</p>
