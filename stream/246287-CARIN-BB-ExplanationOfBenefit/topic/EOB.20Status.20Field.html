<p>The CMS rule mentions including only adjudicated claims.  If we aren't supposed to supply claims that are in progress because they have not entirely finished adjudication, then is anyone using the EOB statuses of draft, entered in error, ect.  It seems like active and cancelled would be the only valid values.  Am I off base?  Thank you for your help</p>
