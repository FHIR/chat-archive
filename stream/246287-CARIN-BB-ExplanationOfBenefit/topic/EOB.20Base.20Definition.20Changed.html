<p>Hello.  I was hoping someone might help clear up some confusion for me.  It  seems like version  v0.1.0 of the CARIN guide , it was acceptable to have EOB as its own profile that can be requested by consuming apps.  Is that correct?  It seems like the build version changes it so that it is an abstract profile that cannot be requested and only is used as a basis for other profiles.  I just want to make sure that the intent of the EOB base profile changed and NOT that it was always intended to work as an abstract.  Thank you for your help.</p>
