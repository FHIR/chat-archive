<p>I bet it'll absolutely useful if the Carin BB team may come up with <strong>max</strong> data EOB samples rather than "some" samples hardly covering a half of the elements. Such sample(s) may look a bit redundant from the business point of view but will be 100% helpful to implementers.</p>
<p>Could you do that?</p>

<p>We appreciate the interest and need for more robust data examples. This has been a bit of an uphill battle as it has difficult to procure realistic data and the means to synthesize such data is not currently available. As I write this, I am working on a project meant to help provide more samples. We continue our invite to the payer community in assisting us in this endeavor.</p>
