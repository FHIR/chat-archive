<blockquote>
<p>At the Madrid Connectathon this past weekend (2017-05-07), a large group of us participating in the CDS Hooks track discussed this issue in an offline discussion. This group of ~12 represented a broad set of stakeholders, from multiple EHR vendors, several CDS Service providers, and a healthcare organization. What follows is the summary of our discussion and the consensus of the group.</p>
<p>It was noted that the <code>iss</code> value (FHIR base URL) wouldn't satisfy all scenarios for the issue noted here. For instance, imagine a CDS Service that specifies and <code>Observation</code> prefetch query which would completely satisfy the needs/logic of this service. Now, imagine an EHR which does not support the <code>Observation</code> resource in its FHIR server but <strong>does</strong> support prefetching this data via some proprietary means. If the Discovery endpoint solely based it's decision on the capabilities of the FHIR server, it would mistakenly think this EHR could not call this CDS Service.</p>
<p>We all agreed that we want to move in the direction of streamlining and automating the integration between EHRs and CDS Services to further minimize offline work around integration. However, the group recognized that our current landscape is not here yet and until that time, it does not make any changes around this.</p>
