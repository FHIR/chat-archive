<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for writing this up @isaacvetter! I agree that soliciting feedback on this here first is better than a PR. Some thoughts:</p>
<p><strong>Hook Maturity</strong><br>
I like how FHIR uses a monotonically increasing number (FMM0, FMM1, FMM2, etc) to describe maturity. This makes it easy to know where something falls onto the maturity scale. Contrast this with the proposal here where, without the additional detail in this table, I could not tell you which is better: "Cleaned up" or "Tested".</p>
<p>I propose we use something like Level 0, Level 1, Level 2, Level 4 instead of the current narrative terms for the aforementioned benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Hook Version</strong><br>
Is the "Hook Version" column expressing an example of possible version or is it prescribing the version of the hook at a particular level? I believe it is the latter given this statement: "Interim minor versions may be used to reflect changes in the hook's change log."</p>
<p>While the hook version addresses some of my concerns with the hook maturity name above, I think it would be best to not try and align the hook version with its maturity. Additionally, the hook version model proposed here does not follow semantic versioning (SemVer). In SemVer, the minor number is the second number (major.minor.revision).</p>
<p>Thus, in the current model, changes to a "Submitted" hook would version like: 0.2, 0.2.1, 0.2.2, etc (changes to the revision number). However, changes to a "Mature" hook would version like: 1.0, 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.2, etc (changed to either the minor or revision number).</p>
<p>I propose we leave the notion of version from the maturity model and let hook authors use SemVer. It is interesting to consider whether hook authors must only version their hook at 1.0 once it reaches the final level of maturity...I'm not sure yet where I sit on that.</p>
<p><strong>Submitted</strong><br>
What is the repository of the PR? Who manages this repository?</p>
<p><strong>Tested</strong><br>
Who merges the PR?</p>
<p><strong>Cleaned-up</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hook is implemented in the standard CDS Hooks sandbox and multiple prototype projects</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think requiring the hook to be implemented in the CDS Hooks Sandbox is really powerful. <span class="emoji emoji-1f44d" title="thumbs up">:thumbs_up:</span> It will require some changes to our Sandbox architecture to allow new hooks to be added in a modular fashion, but this is something we need to do.</p>
<p>*<em>Mature</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hook has been implemented in production in at least two CDS clients and three independent CDS services in more than one country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a really high bar (especially the bit about "more than one country"). For FHIR I think it is less of a high bar since there is only one role being measured -- the FHIR server. However, with CDS Hooks, we have the CDS client + the CDS service. While CDS clients are often deployed to more than one country, I think this is far less likely for CDS services (at least, today).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An HL7 working group ballots the hook and the hook has passed HL7 STU ballot. The FHIR Management Group has approved the hook.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where does the FMG come in here? I think with FHIR the value proposition is that the FMG oversees all resources for consistency. But, they have not yet been involved yet with CDS Hooks. Is the intention here to have some group that ensures consistency across hooks?</p>

<p>@lmckenzi raise a good point on Zulip regarding editing hooks. Specifically, we need to identify a hook owner(s) so that when people have questions, want to propose modifying the hook, etc they know who to reach out to in order to collaborate on any proposed changes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In terms of maturity, it's probably best to clarify what's meant by "FHIR Connectathon" and "implemented".  Are we talking HL7-International hosted connectathons or is an ad-hoc connectathon amongst a small community sufficient.  Do reference implementations count, or do the implementers need to be real clinical/administrative systems?</p>
<p>What is the pull request executed against?  A markdown page of hook candidates?  It might be best to have a separate page per hook.  That way proposed changes to a particular hook can more easily be managed.</p>
<p>The notion of approval being determined by the "author" of the hook is a tad problematic.  Who's the "author" of something that has been revised by a bunch of people and where the original proponent might no longer be an active part of the discussion?  This should really be a community decision.  Could this somehow be managed as a joint discussion with a vote on a call or community thumbs up/thumbs down in an eVote?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I'd like to see us focus on the spirit of what we're trying to achieve in these guidelines/rules. To mean, that means _open_ developer forums/events with a diverse set of participants rather than named/sanctioned events from a particular organization (eg, HL7 Connectathons).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do reference implementations count, or do the implementers need to be real clinical/administrative systems?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reference implementations are great but to a point. At some point, I think you really need implementations on top of existing systems (the real systems you mentioned) as they often has constraints/challenges that reference (aka, greenfield) implementations don't have to worry about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It might be best to have a separate page per hook. That way proposed changes to a particular hook can more easily be managed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly our intention -- a separate page/document per hook.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agree on defining the spirit, but defining the letter can be important too.  My read of "spirit" of "at least two FHIR Connectathons" is "well attended connectathons with a diversity of participation held some time apart".  But the letter could be satisfied by the same group of highly invested stakeholders holding virtual connectathons a couple of weeks apart that they advertise as open to other participants on <a href="http://chat.fhir.org" target="_blank" title="http://chat.fhir.org">chat.fhir.org</a> without an expectation of anyone else showing up.  You will want your policies to help reduce the chances of that sort of gaming the process so that you actually get what you're after - broad community engagement and consensus.  In fact, simply stating up front that what you're after is broad engagement of the full community who would be expected to use/be impacted by the hook and that the criteria will be evalutated in the light of that intention would be helpful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take 2:</p>
<p>### Words describing maturity level</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like how FHIR uses a monotonically increasing number … easy to know where something falls onto the maturity scale</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure that this is true. FMM's levels don't inherently mean anything (they're not _semantic_). Why isn't there an FFM8? Why is FMM3 important … or is that FMM4? The FMM levels aren't naturally _bounded_ nor do they have inherent meaning. I definitely agree that the specific terms could use improvement. I think that it's worthwhile to associate meaning with maturity levels. For sure, "Cleaned up" is a poor term. How about "Documented" (the intent of this level is that the hook is being prepared for formal inclusion -- only hooks that are intended to be formally included will likely hit this level).</p>
<p>### Hook version<br>
Kevin - I think that your point about SemVer is that major changes should be represented in the version number before a hook reaches maturity.  That's pretty convincing, but an arbitrary, non-bounded versioning scheme is worse. I modified the <code>Maturity Level</code> to be 1-10, instead of 0.1 - 1.0. The emphasis on even numbers does make less sense now.</p>
<p>### Submitted<br>
#### &gt;What is the repository of the PR? Who manages this repository?<br>
Yeah, great question. I think that's outside the scope of this issue. Do you disagree? What we've talked about is creating an additional repo in the cds-hooks github project to contain hooks. From a governance perspective, that's a bit problematic. For the purposes of this issue/PR, I'd like to leave it out of scope.</p>
<p>### Considered<br>
#### &gt;is an ad-hoc connectathon amongst a small community sufficient [?]<br>
Lloyd, I understand Da Vinci's model. I intentionally required FHIR Connectathon. This places a minimum timeline of 8 months on the <code>Considered</code> maturity level. I've ignored your good advice and updated the content to explicitly say "HL7 FHIR Connectathon", such that new hooks must be standardized as part of HL7's FHIR Connectathons.<br>
#### &gt;You will want your policies to help reduce the chances of that sort of gaming the process <br>
I also added an additional sentence at the top to state the goals of the process outright.</p>
<p>### Tested <br>
#### Who merges the PR?<br>
The committers of the repo, of course! Seriously, though, see above.</p>
<p>### Mature<br>
#### The hook has been implemented in production in at least two CDS clients and three independent CDS services in more than one country.</p>
<p>Yeah. I do want a high bar for a hook to reach a 1.0/mature status. I think that we're blessed with no region-specific content. I did wonder, while writing this, if any of our three existing hooks could currently meet these requirements. I've removed the multiple countries requirement.</p>
<p>#### An HL7 working group ballots the hook and the hook has passed HL7 STU ballot. The FHIR Management Group has approved the hook.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the intention here to have some group that ensures consistency across hooks?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that the PR approvers should ensure consistency across hooks as part of the <code>Submitted</code> maturity levle. For a <code>Mature</code> status, we further need a formal SDO and more rigorous balloting process. I don't know what the right group is. Maybe the HL7 CDS wg would be more appropriate than the FMG. I removed the FMG requirement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"FHIR Connectathon" doesn't necessarily imply HL7 hosted connectathon.  And even if that were the requirement, would doing the May WGM and June DevDays count?  </p>
<p>I think there's a degree of benefit to aligning our numbering convention with HL7's.  The communities have huge overlap and diverging on numbering is going to be confusing.  I'm not opposed to naming the levels, but the names aren't that critical.  If you know what number things start at, what number things finish at and the criteria to get to each level, that's all the semantic meaning needed.</p>
