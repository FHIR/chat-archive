<blockquote>
<p>The documentation on the decision structure is somewhat lacking. And I think needs to be advanced a bit, as we are attempting to implement this right now.</p>
<p>## Delete Case<br>
In the case the decision indicates an item to be deleted, it makes sense to have the value be a string identifier.</p>
<p>## Create Case<br>
In the create case, the resource doesn't yet exist. Using an identifier could be confusing and also implies that the CDS service would have to host this resource. It is more convenient if the resource to be created is inlined within the decision payload (similar to how this happens with the context).</p>
<p>## Proposal<br>
Don't change <code>delete</code>, continue to specify an array of strings. These identifiers are existing FHIR resources on the specified fhir-server (from the initial service call).</p>
<p>Change <code>create</code> to be an array of (inlined) objects (e.g. FHIR resources).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the well thought out feedback @bkaney.</p>
<p>At the Sept 2017 San Diego Connectathon, the community reached consensus to remove decisions for the 1.0 release (#99) until we obtain more implementer feedback. I think the questions you pose here are further indication that the decisions feature needs quite a bit of further thought, implementation feedback, and documentation.</p>
<p>We will swing back on the decisions feature on a subsequent release. As such, I'm closing this issue with a _deferred_ label.</p>
