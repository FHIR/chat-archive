<blockquote>
<p>At the Madrid Connectathon this past weekend (2017-05-07), a large group of us participating in the CDS Hooks track discussed this issue in an offline discussion. This group of ~12 represented a broad set of stakeholders, from multiple EHR vendors, several CDS Service providers, and a healthcare organization. What follows is the summary of our discussion and the consensus of the group.</p>
<p>We agreed that we should add an optional field on each card for this image. Additionally, we agreed that should be an icon, not a logo. Icons have specific dimensions and other requirements (see for reference <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/graphics/app-icon/" target="_blank" title="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/graphics/app-icon/">Apple's iOS app icon requirements</a>).</p>
<p>We did not discuss concrete requirements for the icon. That will need to be proposed here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey Everybody - a couple of points:</p>
<p>1) This is a nice feature to support. I don't think it's vital to a 1.0 release.<br>
2) I read Apple's App Icon UX guidelines (per @kpshek's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/graphics/app-icon/" target="_blank" title="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/graphics/app-icon/">link</a>). They're solid UX guidelines, but don't help us figure out what should be in the spec.</p>
<p>I think that the primary questions are: <br>
* What size and shape should the icon be?<br>
* Do we need to support multiple icons?</p>
<p>Continuing the analogy to Apple, here's the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1686/_index.html" target="_blank" title="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1686/_index.html">list of sizes</a> that they require. (Note that they're all square). </p>
<p>@gotdan pointed to <a href="https://api.slack.com/docs/messages#composing_messages" target="_blank" title="https://api.slack.com/docs/messages#composing_messages">slack's card format</a> as an analogy in #33, but I don't think they're supporting dynamic icons.</p>
<p><strong>I'm going to propose that cards can define a small square icon of 40x40px (apple spotlight size) and a large icon of 120x120px. The card should point to a url.</strong></p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="isaacvetter@gmail.com" data-user-id="558">@Isaac Vetter</span> - Thanks for trying to reign in the discussion to a concrete proposal. I've reached out to some of our UX designers to get their feedback on dimensions as well as specifics such as alpha channels. I'll reply back here with their feedback. Feedback from others is also welcome!</p>
<p>I was hoping we could define just a single optional attribute for this, rather than having multiple attributes for varying sizes. But, I was waiting to hear back from my UX designer colleagues.</p>
