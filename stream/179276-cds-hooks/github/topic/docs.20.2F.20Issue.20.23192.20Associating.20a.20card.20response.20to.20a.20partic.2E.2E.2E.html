<blockquote>
<p>I was thinking about the need to associate a card response to a particular resource in context when there is more than one resource (FHIR bundle) in the context. I am looking for input from this group on this.</p>
<p>An option to tackle this currently, is to send one resource in context per CDS Hooks request and so response by default can be associated to the resource in context but would involve who ever making hooks request to establish this associated back through the hookInstance</p>
<p>One of the use case which triggered this post is suggested content notification use case. Let's take the example of results review hook, where the results review CDS service's jobs is to responds back with info card w/links to results interpretation content (only when the content exist and suggested) for an particular observation in context. The ultimate need for above is the case when you want to show the Card Response as an icon (on mouse over shows the card response and on clicking opens the knowledge content) next to the particular lab result in Context.  First question, is if CDS hooks the right solution to tackle this use case?</p>

<p>If so, what can be the approach? extension or one request per resource or ?</p>
