<p>Hey @stefan-evinance , </p>
<p>Overall, the current approach doesn't exclude an EHR from using a 3rd party authentication provider, it simply doesn't define the interaction between the EHR and this provider. Note that this is the same approach as SMART.</p>
<p>The defined approach (a jwt in the authorization http header) is an authentication mechanism that's reasonable for my EHR as is the OAuth2 access_token for authentication. </p>
<p>We do have a fair number of EHRs involved in the review, testing and creation of this specification. Can you help us get the feedback from these additional EHRs that you're suggesting is needed? </p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed CORS configuration is clearly identified as for testing ...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should _carefully consider_ how you support CORS, but a _quick starting point_ _for testing_ would be to ensure your CDS Service returns the following HTTP headers:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that it's outside the scope of this spec to instruct implementers on CORS configuration. Do you think that this section should be removed?</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback @stefan-evinance!</p>

<p>We have #87 to address how public keys are discovered to address your concern. The JWT allows the CDS Service to establish whether the entity making a request to it is a trusted EHR. We are not using the JWT to authenticate or assert an identity of a _user_.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We chose to not have the CDS Service obtain an access token on each request as this would increase latency / the amount of time to service a request (since a token would have to be obtained on each call).</p>
<p>The interesting thing with your use case is that the authorization server is not owned by the EHR. With SMART and the vendor implementations I am aware of, the EHR and authorization server are assumed to have a trusted relationship (and likely owned/written by the same vendor). In your case, if the authorization server is a separate entity from the EHR, then I agree that having the EHR take the access token and provide it to the CDS Service opens up another threat.</p>
<p>However, as <span class="user-mention" data-user-email="isaacvetter@gmail.com" data-user-id="558">@Isaac Vetter</span> mentioned, I'll echo his comments that with both SMART and CDS Hooks we are assuming that there exists a trust relationship between the EHR and authorization server. In the Argonaut project, we are going to be doing a 3rd party threat assessment of the security model in CDS Hooks. I'll make sure we enumerate this threat.</p>
<p>Another thing I should note is that we had a conversation yesterday in which we discussed whether an EHR is required to provide an access token in the CDS Service request. I think we landed on that this is optional. For your use case, I think this would alleviate your concerns.</p>

<p>Agree with both your feedback here as what <span class="user-mention" data-user-email="isaacvetter@gmail.com" data-user-id="558">@Isaac Vetter</span> said. We need to clarify this.</p>
