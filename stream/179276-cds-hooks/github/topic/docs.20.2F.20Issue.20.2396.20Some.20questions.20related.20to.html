<blockquote>
<p>The spec states that a Decision contains a list of id(s) of resource(s) that the EHR should create/remove from the current activity. I'm a bit puzzled how this is supposed to work. Some clarification, e.g. an example, would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Some questions related to this topic:<br>
1. How does the service that is called using the link card know what objects are present in the current activity? Is the scope of a Decision limited to the the content of the hook specific context?</p>
<p>2. As the decision is passing id's. Is it the responsibility of the CDS Service to persist the related changes in the FHIR repository, so that the EHR can retrieve them and add to the current activity?</p>
<p>3. Can we assume that all interaction on the EHR screen has been made persistent in the FHIR repository so that they are accessible by the CDS Service?</p>
