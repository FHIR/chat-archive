<blockquote>
<p>In the section "CDS Decisions" it is stated that "To return a decision after a user interaction, the CDS service must maintain state associated with the request’s hookInstance; when the EHR invokes the hook for a second time with the same hookInstance, the service can respond with decisions on as well as cards".</p>
<p>To my knowledge this is not the typical behavior when calling webservices. <br>
Preferably one would have the CDS services stateless and store the state in the EHR application. When it invokes the service, it will pass the state. This prevents a lot of (difficult) bookkeeping in the services (such as determining when how long a state should be maintained).  </p>
<p><strong>Suggested change:</strong><br>
Preferably one would have the CDS services stateless and store the state in the EHR application. Can’t we have the CDS Service pass a optional “opaque” state object when it redirects back to the EHR. The EHR then appends this object to the CDS Service request. Thereby passing the state.</p>
