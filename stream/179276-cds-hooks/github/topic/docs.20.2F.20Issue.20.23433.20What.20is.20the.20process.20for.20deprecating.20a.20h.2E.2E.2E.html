<blockquote>
<p>Do we have a process for deprecating an existing hook? Is this necessary? Is this something that should be added to the maturity model in #195? We now have PRs for order-select and order-sign, so I was wondering whether medication-prescribe / order-review can explicitly be marked as deprecated, or there should be some other process, or just left as it is. (Although I don't know why an EHR would support them if it supports order-select/order-sign - I feel that, hooks should be tied to workflow, and not be a proxy to limit the content of the context.)</p>
