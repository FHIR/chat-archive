<blockquote>
<p>Are there any thoughts on how to advertise/handle the CDS Hooks service version?</p>
<p>This could be handled as part of the service discovery -- e.g. include the version as an attribute in the <code>cds-services</code> payload.</p>

<p>I'll disagree that we don't need to address this today as Stanson Health's solution is already providing multiple versions in production. The reality that the movement of the standard is rather slow, resulting in either un-official versions (which I have 2 of now) or extension needs which get augmented over time both on the caller and service ends. For example, the change from patient and encounter in the main request to being part of the context was a significantly breaking change - I realize the spec isn't official yet, but not allowing early implementations (and thereby multiple versions) leads to a chicken and the egg problem. At the moment URL differences are used, in part to allow easy movement by the EMR from one version to the next with minimal support by the service as well as supporting 'custom' versions on a one-off basis. </p>
<p>With respect to every call containing the Hooks specification, I believe this still should require the version(s) supported shown in the discovery or via some other mechanism. Ideally that would be coupled with the specification details in some form, such that an implementer could access those details and build their interface to the service without additional documentation.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this and the FHIR version (which we certainly have 2 standards and both in production to various degrees) should be implemented similarly.</p>
<p>Ultimately I don't think this is a particularly hard issue to solve, and I really don't see it as controversial - unless the standard is a dead-end, there will be multiple versions.</p>

<p>FWIW, since the return of the discover call is also subject to variations across CDS Hooks versions, I'd opt to expose the version as an HTTP Header.</p>

<p>I just want to add here that we are also now affected by this. We have released code where user is at the top level. However, user has now been moved to the context. Yet there is no version or any kind of differentiator we can include to allow the CDS Service to determine whether the payload has this change or not, (short of looking to see where the user is).</p>
<p>So adding myself also on the list of affected parties requesting some capability on this front.</p>
