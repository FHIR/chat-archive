<blockquote>
<p>We would like to implement this use-case with CDS Hooks.<br>
- CDS request for starting of a calculation.<br>
- Returning the result of this calculation.</p>
<p>Quite basic, but the calculation takes a long time, typical several minutes.<br>
I don't think that sending the response after finishing the calculation is good practice.<br>
So the idea is to send a CDS response after basic intake of pre-fetched data.<br>
After the calculation is completed, it is then needed to push the status / result.</p>
<p>1. - One way within CDS Hook context I see is mis-use a ad-hock request to the EHR FHIR service  to push the status.<br>
2. - Or use the redirect URL from the request to push status.<br>
3. - Or add a proprietary URL in the request for this purpose<br>
4. - Polling using a second CDS request is possible, using a elapsed time indication returned in the CDS Hook reply, is possible but not preferred.</p>
<p>Please advice. Am I missing or misinterpreting something?</p>
<p>Please also refer to this Zulip topic. <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/cds-hooks/subject/CDS.20async.20reply/near/93110" target="_blank" title="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/cds-hooks/subject/CDS.20async.20reply/near/93110">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/cds-hooks/subject/CDS.20async.20reply/near/93110</a></p>
