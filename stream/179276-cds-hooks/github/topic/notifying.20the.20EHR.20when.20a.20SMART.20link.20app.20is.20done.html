<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191355">@Kevin Shekleton</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191864">@Isaac Vetter</span> Here's a scenario I'm trying to work through.  A user clicks on a link in a cds-hooks card that launches a SMART app in a separate window.  Once the user completes the workflow in the new window I would want to 1) close the window, and 2) cause the original page that launched the workflow to update so that if there are new cards to display, they will be visible.  Is that the kind of workflow you would expect to occur in your respective EHRs, and if so, how can we implement something like that in the sandbox?</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193229">@Kevin Olbrich</span> !</p>
<p>If you can, it would make sense to move this conversation from cds hook/github, to the cds hooks stream. </p>
<p>Except for the need for the app to be in an external window, you have described the "decisions" workflow. Check out this <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/commit/447cd8778f065b855f19fd3a1b02a27db895af62?short_path=1a523bd#diff-1a523bd9fa0dbf998008b37579210e12" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/commit/447cd8778f065b855f19fd3a1b02a27db895af62?short_path=1a523bd#diff-1a523bd9fa0dbf998008b37579210e12">older version of the spec</a>. We took out this pretty awesome feature because very few people had implemented it and it wasn't obvious that the all the technical bits were right.</p>
<p>Note that SMART really tends to assume that the app is running in an embedded window/iframe. How would you expect the EHR to know that the workflow in the external window is complete?</p>
