<blockquote>
<p>When a hook is triggered, the related CDS Services are called. They may return one or more Cards.<br>
Is the EHR required to show them all? What happens when there are more cards than can fit the screen?</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion</strong>: The EHR MUST provide access to all cards. SHOULD display them all. MAY present them in a ListBox. </p>

<p>Hey @bvdh ,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MAY present them in a ListBox.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm wary of trying to dictate EHR UI. In general, the CDS Hooks spec purposely permits UI to remain the responsibility of the EHR. We want the CDS service's cards to appear native in the EHR UI. Further, my opinion is that dictating UI hinders innovation in UX.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The EHR MUST provide access to all cards. SHOULD display them all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, I think that the EHR should (continue to) be enabled to dynamically decide what guidance to provide to the clinician based upon the priority and amount of internal and external guidance available. In practice, this could mean using the CDS Hooks response indicator element to prioritize the guidance displayed to the user.</p>

<p>Isaac, </p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response.<br>
The ListBox suggestion is just a suggestion. I have no clear opinion on whether this should be in or out.</p>
<p>The second part is more important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The EHR MUST provide access to all cards. SHOULD display them all</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CDS Services work with clinical data and may provide relevant information. The EHR cannot determine what the (medical) risks are for not showing the feedback of the CDS Service. As such I think that it should be mandatory that all cards must be accessible. Preferably shown.<br>
We could limit mandating this to only cards with &lt;warning&gt; and &lt;hard-stop&gt; response indicators.</p>
