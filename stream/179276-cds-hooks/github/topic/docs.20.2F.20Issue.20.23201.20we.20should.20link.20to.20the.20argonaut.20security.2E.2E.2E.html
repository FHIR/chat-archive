<blockquote>
<p>The Argonaut security review of cds hooks resulted in (a number of changes to the pre-1.0 specification as well as) a security review pdf report). </p>
<p>The report is detailed, considerate and independent and that security review process is an asset to the specification. </p>
<p>I'm not sure of the best location on the site to host / describe the report. It shouldn' be within the specification itself, because it's supporting material. Maybe a new header within the Community page? Something like:<br>
Argonaut Security Review:<br>
To mature the CDS Hooks specification to 1.0, the Argonaut Project conducted a <a href="http://example.com/link-to-security-review" target="_blank" title="http://example.com/link-to-security-review">independent security review</a> of the specification, which identified and addressed a number of potential risks. </p>
