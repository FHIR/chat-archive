<p>Is there a summary of what was done and/or knowledge base we could work on?  I'd really like to get this moving on!</p>

<p>We did some stuff on ConMan in Baltimore <a href="http://conman.fhir.org/connectathon.html?event=baltimore2018" target="_blank" title="http://conman.fhir.org/connectathon.html?event=baltimore2018">http://conman.fhir.org/connectathon.html?event=baltimore2018</a> look at ClinicalResearch scenario 4.  I'm keen to make more progress but it was a bit of a solitary effort with background cheering.</p>

<p>Ok, I'm thinking about setting a PhUSE project to look at it.  With the MOU in place between PhUSE and HL7 I think it presents a pretty interesting project.</p>

<p>I was (quietly) cheering!</p>

<p>I was (less quietly) cheering at the rugby this weekend.  I need to work out what makes sense as a framework for developing this; we have an implementation domain model through ODM (which I know people rankle at, but it's what is supported by most of the data capture systems) and a DAM though BRIDG.</p>

<p>Ah, the mythical ODM model!  I keep asking but no-one has yet managed to produce a live example of one of these.  Asking in Baltimore there was muttering that "yes we can/do generate it but it never gets used for anything".  I think we really need to nail this down as a serious starting point (or not).  I'm inclined to "not" because if we get something working retro fitting it is not going to change what we have put together I think.</p>

<p>Not mythical.  I can share one, both vanilla and with mdsol extensions (both data and metadata).  It is aligned with the model of data collection (ClinicalData -&gt; SubjectData -&gt; VisitData -&gt; FormData -&gt; ItemData) and planning (Metadata -&gt; VisitDef -&gt; FormDef -&gt; ItemDef).  Let's have a call to walk through</p>

<p>For anyone interested I'm doing a walkthrough of the CDISC ODM today at 1400 BST, ping me for an invite.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192121">@Geoff Low</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196523">@Hugh Glover</span>  would like to reopen discussion on the SoA, as TCB would like to know which groups are working in this area and seeking partnership on this.  Our use case would be to take a digitized protocol from sponsor, send (electronically) to site, have site set up visit schedule and patient appointments.  it sounds like PhUSE and HL7.   Hugo Leroux was also working in this space.  Are there others?  </p>
<p>Also, saw Sam Hume's presentation on CDM-ODM.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192121">@Geoff Low</span>  is this the piece we would need to represent the protocol? Sam mentioned that there is only a placeholder in the existing ODM 1.x.x.</p>

<p>Apologies, missed this.  I haven't logged in a while.  I used the ODM as an exemplar of a Research Schedule of Activities as it is a common model.  We are looking to start investigation of this in the PhUSE Research on FHIR project.  We've started to pull together some requirements (technical rather than use case) - the Use Cases for BR&amp;R seem concordant with what we would like to follow.</p>

<p>We have a meeting tomorrow as part of the Research On FHIR PhUSE project to work through some of the mechanics of SoA vs FHIR archetypes, let me know if you are interested.</p>

<p>Nope, not that advanced yet.  Scoping out the analogues between Research Activities and FHIR resources (Protocol ~ PlanDefinition etc)</p>
