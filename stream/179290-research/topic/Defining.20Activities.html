<p>A study will typically have some activities that are ubiquitous and others that are specific to the study.   For example every study will have an activity of "Get Informed consent". This starts me thinking about libraries of such things (and the ActivityDefinition can be linked to a library) and also about the governance of entries in the library and other sorts of meta data.  Do we see this library being something to explore or am I just making life too complicated?</p>

<p>I think you're just exploring how to represent existing complexity :)  Libraries are certainly an option, though you don't have to have a Library resource in order to have a server that hosts a bunch of reuseable ActivityDefinitions, PlanDefinitions, ValueSets, profiles and other artifacts.</p>

<p>To add to this, the library element in ActivityDefinition is intended to allow an ActivityDefinition to reference expression logic contained within that library. To create a Library that was a collection of ActivityDefinitions, you'd just specify the component ActivityDefinitions in the Library, rather than referencing the containing library from the ActivityDefinition.</p>
