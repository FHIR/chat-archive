<p>Hi Everyone! My name is Inèz Sikkel and I'm a Medical Informatics student. For my internship I'm doing a small study on how HL7 FHIR can be used to semantically map clinical (research) data. I would like to Interview experts who have already tried to map data with FHIR. I am specifically interested in how FHIR was implemented (what servers, resources were used). Where the mapping was used for and if you succeeded. </p>
<p>The questions are the following:</p>
<p>1.  How did you use FHIR to map clinical data?<br>
2.  In what setting did you use FHIR? Data extraction, consents, recruitment, data standardization, device integration <br>
3.  How was FHIR implemented? Has your organization a FHIR server integrated? <br>
4.  What FHIR resources did you use?<br>
5.  Is the FHIR mapping still used? <br>
6.  What would you recommend for a new organization to use FHIR?</p>
<p>It shouldn't take more than <strong>15-20 minutes</strong>. Is anyone available for a phone call/zoom call this week?</p>

<p>Hey, sorry for missing this.  <br>
The primary use case is to access the subject data for incorporation in Case Report Forms (CRFs) - the primary unit of work for clinical trial data capture.  The CRFs are (unfortunately) electronic representations of paper forms that would be entered by the Investigator for a study participant to record the information required per protocol.  The broad requirement is to gather resources for a Patient (subsetted to cover the information required for a study) and push this data into the CRFs.  You should look at the ResearchStudy and ResearchSubject resources.  </p>
<p>In terms of the datan, on the clinical side we have our own set of standards for representation of common concepts.  These are defined by CDISC (<a href="http://www.cdisc.org" target="_blank" title="http://www.cdisc.org">http://www.cdisc.org</a>) and are driven by the collection and analysis use cases.  The data are partitioned more discreetly than FHIR resources into domains based on core clinical concepts (and I use this term loosely) - domains are broadly broken down into observation classes (Events, Findings, Interventions and Special Purpose).  <br>
Events are based around patient state changes (such as Medical History/Adverse Events/Subject Disposition)<br>
Findings are based around observations on a patient (such as Lab results, Vital Signs, ECG)<br>
Interventions are based around changes applied to a patients (such as Concomitant Medications, Investigational Product Administration, Study Procedures)<br>
Special Purpose are based around other things (such as Demographics)<br>
As you can see, they cut across many contexts of FHIR resources (ie Findings are broadly ~ Observations, Events ~ Condition, Interventions ~ MedicationStatement/Administration, etc).  In addition, as research concepts they can be much more prescriptive about the types of data collected.<br>
The mapping for the moment is based on taking a CDISC domain/variable set and then aligning these with FHIR resources/attributes.  There are some issues around coding systems in use (research is generally restricted to WHODrug/MEDDRA/CDISC defined NCI subsets) which are not broadly used outside the research domain (the NCI-t values are often annotated so there is some crosswalk there).  <br>
In terms of presentations that I'm aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>papers on this have been presented at PhUSE conferences by Research on FHIR group</li>
<li>There have been a couple of papers presented at CDISC conferences (the EHR to CDASH project is one to lookup)</li>
<li>I presented something at the Boston DevDay last year, and Transcelerate presented something at the Amsterdam DevDay (and I believe they will also be in Seattle)</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a bunch of information there.  Let me know if you have other queries</p>
