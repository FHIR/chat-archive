<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a medical student with a background in computer science. My research topic for my MD is to look into reducing the time to diagnosis for rare genetic kidney disease. The hospital is currently implementing Epic so integrating a tool with it sounds like the best way to do this.</p>
<p>The question being “how”, in my mind the tool would be a standalone app going through every patient file that changed since the last run and perform some kind of analysis and trigger alerts when it finds something. How should I go about gathering all this information? Is FHIR even the correct technology for this?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time</p>

<p>The simplest would be simply running a query filtering by lastUpdated so you only see content that's been created since last changed/created.  You'll probably need to look at the "bulk data" interfaces, as most EHR's standard query interfaces don't support cross-patient query.  In terms of alerts, you could auto-generate Observations into the record, though that doesn't guarantee anyone would look at them.  You could use CDS Hooks to trigger someone to pay attention - and maybe even launch a SMART-on-FHIR app to show the analysis when someone does a patient look-up or otherwise interacts with the patient.</p>
