<p>It doesn't seem like there is much activity in this stream, but maybe someone will know...</p>
<p>In the valueset  at <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-research-study-status.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-research-study-status.html</a></p>
<p>the definition  "Study is closed to accrual and intervention, i.e. the study is closed to enrollment, all study subjects have completed treatment or intervention but are still being followed according to the primary objective of the study."    seems to be reused for  "closed-to-accrual-and-intervention"   and for "completed",  is this a typo?   If yes, how is "completed"  different?  Does it mean that all following of subjects is completed also?</p>

<p>You are right that the definition in R4 suffered from a cut and paste error.  What is probably more helpful is to look at the state machine the terms represent:  <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/researchstudy.html#statemachine">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/researchstudy.html#statemachine</a>.  You can see here that the sequence is "Closed to accrual" &gt; "closed to accrual and intervention" &gt; "closed".</p>
<p>However in R5 we separated publication status ResearchStudy.status from the actual status of the study which is now in ResearchStudy.currentState.  This latter attribute uses the same terminology as in R4 with the same typo!  I've raised a jira to correct this: <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-33096">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-33096</a></p>
