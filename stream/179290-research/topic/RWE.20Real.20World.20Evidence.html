<p>Friends,<br>
There are some important things I want to point out.<br>
In 2016 the FDA launched a program called Real World Data and Real World Evidence (RWD / RWE).<br>
This type of study points to some research failures that propose overcontrolled situations, and establishes a new paradigm of analysis on data.<br>
Such a situation requires much more automation than we have today for field data collection, but the acceleration of hardware / IoT adoption and its accuracy has improved, so we are facing an interesting reality that can be exploited from a monitoring standpoint, in care or eventually population environments.<br>
I am involved with some projects of this nature in Brazil, if anyone is aligned with this and wants to share experiences with me in this sector, I would like to meet.<br>
Guilherme</p>

<p>Do you guys already work with FHIR Big Data framework? How mature is this project?</p>
