<p>The issues we were seeing yesterday with the IG Publisher are resolved, for now. The site that FHIR-I uses to store the various versions of the IG publisher was experiencing difficulties yesterday, but seem to have resolved.<br>
Additionally, the issue in trifolia-fhir-dev that we saw yesterday (where we couldn't see your IG's profiles) should now be resolved.</p>
