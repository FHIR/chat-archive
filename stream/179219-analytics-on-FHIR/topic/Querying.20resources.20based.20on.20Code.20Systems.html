<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I can see that a list of Code Systems can be obtained by hitting <code>/CodeSystem</code>, but I'm looking to query and get a list of resources that utilize a specific Code System, for example - if attributes in the "Patient" resource support SNOMED CT, I'd like to search and get that information. Is there a way to query and get this type of information? I was trying to query based on <code>system</code> urls and it didn't seem to be work. Thanks!</p>
