<p>Hey, a few people have asked me about OMOP  / OHDSI recently. Does anyone here have any opinions about when you would use OMOP and when it would be better to use a database of FHIR resources?</p>

<p>I did some work converting MIMIC3 to OMOP a while back. My impression was that the biggest advantages of OMOP are the extensive suite of analytical tools (Atlas) and the federated query network for research (Arachne). Interoperability lives or dies on its network effects.</p>
<p>My observation 2 years ago was that when I went to a research event almost everyone was using OMOP and had never heard of FHIR, and when I went to an industry event it was exactly the reverse. But that has evolved a bit since then.</p>

<p>In many cases, systems already have an OMOP network of data and are putting a FHIR facade in front of it.  I've been on two projects (one right now) where that is exactly the situation.  All of the providers are already putting their data into an OMOP repository so we have a ready source of medical information.  Converting that data into FHIR resources and having the providers change their interface to talk FHIR is probably a non-starter.  Instead, we are putting our analytic apps on top of the OMOP database and providing a FHIR way of interfacing with it.</p>

<p>For analytics I would currently prefer OMOP over FHIR because OMOP comes with a widely-used query language (SQL) that most analysts are already capable of. As long as there are no commercial vendors of CQL engines to ease the combined task of accessing the FHIR data and directly doing analytics operations, the access to FHIR has to be done using  the FHIR search API. This requires the analyst to first export the FHIR data and then to analyze it with another programming langauge (R, C#, Java). For rapid prototyping research projects this is an obstruction. Perhaps this combined task is possible with GraphQL or FHIRPath (with which I do not have any experience yet).</p>

<p>The SQL schema is given. Therefor the bidirectional mapping has to bridge to the hard constraints, either by adding complexity to the mapping, or by mapping to app. restricted FHIR profiles.</p>

<p>One of the things that has confused me about FHIR and OMOP is that, if FHIR is more transactional in nature (OLTP) and OMOP more analytical (OLAP), why are all the projects (like <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cdmh/profiles.html" target="_blank" title="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cdmh/profiles.html">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cdmh/profiles.html</a>) mapping OMOP-to-FHIR?  I would have expected FHIR-to-OMOP mappings and some sort of ETL process for populating OMOP tables from FHIR data.  Does anything like that exist?</p>

<p>a more challenging question for me and a couple of OMOP users is: why is OMOP so much simpler than FHIR</p>
<p>I think the answer is "OMOP has not yet encountered many use cases that the FHIR Community has" but the OMOP users I have talked to dislike that answer very greatly</p>

<p>We believe there is a way to make analytics on FHIR simple and efficient, <br>
<a href="https://www.devdays.com/amsterdam/schedule-2019/#event-801" target="_blank" title="https://www.devdays.com/amsterdam/schedule-2019/#event-801">https://www.devdays.com/amsterdam/schedule-2019/#event-801</a></p>
<p>starting with a "low hanging fruit" of making Apache Parquet one of the FHIR bulk export formats. Parquet is the leading format in the big data analytics industry today, and fortunately FHIR maps to it directly (see a report in the bulk data channel). This allows to run SQL etc on FHIR data, using the top open source tools like Apache Spark - that supports not only SQL, but also machine learning on Parquet data. This works today, without dependency on the sql-on-fhir project, because Spark/Parquet can handle the existing FHIR/JSON structure.</p>
<p>An additional step could be using Parquet as the FHIR storage backend (for relevant resources only; the rest would still be stored in a database as done today). This is feasible (shown), and enables export-free analytics on FHIR data.</p>
<p>Then, as the sql-on-fhir project makes progress, it's results can be applied to the two items above. This will allow to further simplify the SQL/FHIR  queries and improve the user experience.</p>

<p>We do a lot of work with OMOP at Georgia Tech and actually make an OMOP &lt;-&gt; FHIR package that translates between the two (<a href="https://github.com/omoponfhir" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/omoponfhir">https://github.com/omoponfhir</a>).  A great resource on OMOP/OHDSI is the Book of OHDSI (<a href="http://book.ohdsi.org" target="_blank" title="http://book.ohdsi.org">book.ohdsi.org</a> or IRL on Amazon).</p>
<p>OMOP tends to be preferable for dealing with complex cohort definitions and the OHDSI community offers quite a few tools to design cohorts, run comparative effectiveness studies, predictive models, evaluate phenotype performance etc.  OMOP works with the usual SQLs as well as Impala, Netezza, GBQ, Redshift, etc.  So that is handy for many places that have existing infrastructure and may not have familiarity with something like Parquet.</p>
<p>As a long time OMOP person and a medium-time FHIR person, I'd say that getting phenotyping using FHIR to be as easy and fast to iterate as it is using something like OMOP is a very important goal to really advance FHIR for large scale population analytics.</p>

<p>My usual explanation is that OMOP is happy to <em>summarize</em> data in ways compatible with / useful for observational research. And obviously summary data are simpler than full data.</p>

<p>Let's take translations, for instance: OMOP allows for the notion of one "source code" and one "standard code" for a given entry, and that's it. So you either throw away some translations, or you turn a single problem in your patient's problem list into two rows of the OMOP Condition table (which isn't "proper" use of OMOP but something I've seen in the real world when people bump up against this constraint).</p>

<p>To build on that, OMOP has a very clear use case (observational clinical research) where FHIR has quite a broad portfolio of use cases. I think the difference in complexity is inevitable from the problem scope.</p>

<p>I am really curious about how people are approaching change management around this. How are your organizations addressing the mindset of where the status quo is "only ever relational"? I keep running into scaling challenges with relational databases using a FHIR-like model, particularly around nested properties and extensions - but we keep being told "you have to use (our chosen) relational database." We've suggested the idea of inverting the model as has been described in this thread. Instead of storing in a relational database, store with documents and then expose via SQL so people can query in a relational way. There's just a general dismissal that a relational engine isn't good enough/flexible enough/fast enough/etc. that that the nature of healthcare data directly lends itself to a relational model. Maybe that's true, but it just feels like short of embracing relational "anti-patterns" like key-value pairs, we'd be spending a lot of time designing a fixed, inflexible relational model that would be difficult to implement and even harder to scale. Can we implement a FHIR-oriented set of tables in a relational model? Sure. It feels like it's going to be complex, brittle, and likely slow, but it can be done...ish. Extensions are tough. Scaling is going to get expensive really quick. I can see the economics of a document-centric model being more appealing - throwing commodity hardware at the problem and scaling out instead of up. Sorry, at this point I'm rambling. How are you approaching groups that seem unwilling to embrace the notion that a data warehouse is bigger than a single tool/approach?</p>

<p>I generally don't bother approaching them, I'm afraid. Having a prejudicial notion about this as a flag waving incompetence at this point. OTOH Being realistic and understanding you have constraints that mean you can't have those discussions in the way everyone wants... that's a good thing. Because every one has constraints like that.</p>
<p>Having said that... my view is that this is moving the deck chairs on the titanic; all the approaches will have problems one way or another</p>

<p>Hey everyone!<br>
I'm putting this here because many people have moved a bit away from OMOP to discuss SQL :D</p>
<p>I'm very interested by the SQL on FHIR initiative but I haven't found lots of details about it. In particular what's cool about this idea is that virtually everyone one know this query model, while graphql would be smarter but less user friendly for beginners.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I don't think anyone would want to really transform their FHIR data into SQL tables (well at least not everyone!) and we shouldn't make any assumption on how people really store your data (mongo, postgres+jsonb, etc). The best way to query data would then be the rest API again because this is the most used interface.</p>
<p>So, putting back together my ideas: I'd like a SQL-like language which would transform the query into (possibly &gt;1) API calls and involve minimal post-processing on the data.</p>
<p>Does this sounds conceptually like feasible? We're trying to do a small proof of concept (open-source) but I'd like feedback on the overall direction before diving too much into it :)</p>
<p>NB: many people have mentioned here Azure, Google etc. I'm living in France so this is not even an option for french hospitals haha + I believe solutions should also be available for people not using the cloud or being beginner developers (not everyone can use spark out of the box)</p>

<p>So, I don't know about "minimal post-processing on the data" :) but CQL is a query language that will do this. You express the query in an SQL-like language, and can then transform it to suit a particular target. The most developed of those targets right now is the FHIR API. Still lots of hard work to do no doubt, but it is progressing.</p>

<p>The challenge with translating queries from a rich language like SQL or CQL into a series of rest API calls (assuming you're thinking about the current FHIR REST API and not some future state where it expands dramatically) is that only a limited number of query constraints and clauses would be directly supported. You would need to over fetch by a huge margin in order to do client side filtering; for population level queries this is not likely to scale well. It's generally important to push as much logic as possible into the query engine that runs close to the data, for a system like this to perform well.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="252922">@Théo Ryffel</span> Perhaps we should talk because I have followed this exact train of thought (including the GraphQL and open-source considerations).</p>
<p>Some thoughts I'd add... </p>
<p>1) SQL-style syntaxes do end up being somewhat influenced by the underlying architecture (for example, some things are possible in postgres that are not possible in mongo and vice versa). So rolling your own SQL-like syntax just makes an additional SQL flavor to throw into the mix. iirc a SQL syntax for FHIR is being discussed. Keeping in sync with whatever might be made into an official HL7 spec would be useful.</p>
<p>2) What you are proposing is similar to how people use GraphQL proxies to transition away from REST APIs. You're just using a different query syntax. The idea is that you throw a proxy GraphQL endpoint over the REST API to allow developers to work with the GraphQL API interface immediately. You will take a performance hit doing massive joins post-REST response. It's not an efficient solution but works as a great intermediate step when transitioning between the two API paradigms. The ultimate goal would be some sort of server-side adoption with server-side resolvers. I wonder if you could leverage GraphQL technology and simply change the query syntax.</p>
<p>3) The need pull data through the FHIR REST API and perform inefficient joins is problem specific to <em>real-time</em> analytics (assuming Bulk API support). In many cases we're stuck using whatever FHIR server an IT department has enabled to query live data. If you can tolerate up to 24 hours of lag time, you can use a tool like Apache Drill on the raw Bulk JSON files or import those JSON files into a psql server like FhirBase. Hypothetically, you could build a system where the same query will be executed differently depending on whether you wanted the live analytics. Currently, I'm focusing on the stale data solution. </p>
<p>4) You probably want to also keep big batch/stream processing frameworks in mind. These joins are going to be expensive on big N.</p>

I'm 100% with all being said here. My use case would be for Machine Learning, so this would mean load lots of data (big N) but in the meantime it does has to be very efficient, because once the data is extracted then the ML workflow is much slower anyway. So I would favour practicability over efficiency I guess.</p>

<p>The NLM is using OMOP / OHDSI for storage of data in the All of Us Research program.  There's a gateway between Sync for Science and the OMOP database for All of Us hosted at Vanderbuilt.  I don't know many more details than that.  But that would be a reason to use OHDSI instead of FHIR, because the platform for sharing is already using OHDSI.</p>

<p>Correct re: OMOP Oncology Vocabulary which I do attend on occasion. The work is nascent in some spots, particularly with chemo drug regimens. In a similar vein, HL7 is also rather nascent (despite multiple attempts) to model it so cross-pollination is helpful. I have recommended this to Rimma and Christian before so I suspect the paths will cross at some point.</p>
