<p>Can we think more about the timing within a schedule?  We need  to represent: </p>
<ul>
<li>days (time) between activities - one way is to relate each activity to the one before, another is to relate each to a single fixed anchor date, are there others?</li>
<li>windowing of dates - is this a per visit thing or is it a blanket across all visits?  How would we handle exceptions?</li>
</ul>

<p>We've been talking about that; the two possibilities (assuming use of PlanDefinition) are to define a duration of the action using the timing[x] or through the use of the relatedAction.offsetDuration/Range (using the actionId to cross reference).  With the relationship the link can be forward or backward looking (or at the same time).  Some activities run continuously (eg collection of CM/AE) - the windowing can be done with offsetRange - but you lose the target day (ie Visit 2 happens 21 days after visit 1 +/- 2 days) - that might be a candidate for an extension as the +/- can be asymmetric about the target day</p>

<p>The exact same question about duration and range has just been asked on the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179166" href="/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers">#implementers</a> stream!</p>
