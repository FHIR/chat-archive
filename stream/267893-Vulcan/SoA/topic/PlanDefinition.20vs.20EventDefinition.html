<p>Ok, I think I know why didn't look at EventDefinition -&gt; we started with the workflow section of the documentation and that doesn't reference EventDefinition so it wasn't really on the radar.  We were primarily interested in the initiation of events to satisfy the protocol requirements and the combination of PlanDefinition (for complex activities) and ActivityDefintion (for 'simple' activities) seemed to work (per the deck Hugh shared).  Looking at the EventDefinition resource I still think PlanDefinition and ActivityDefinition align better with what we laid out.  Happy to be proved wrong</p>

<p>I was just digging too.  EventDefinition so far as I can see is just a sub-set of PlanDefinition (I suspect it is an earlier attempt that has got lost).  I don't think there is anything you can do with EventDefinition that can't also be done with PlanDefinition, but PlanDefinition allows an assortment of additional features (actions, goals, related actions).  Like Geoff happy to be proved wrong ...</p>
