<p>Hello!<br>
In just about clinical trial SoA, visits exist that have what I'll call "relative timing" as well as visit windows. Typically, the timing of a visit is relative to "Day 1" (usually a Baseline visit). For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Baseline visit<br>
-- Timing: Day 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visit 2:<br>
-- Timing: Day 10<br>
-- Visit Window: +/- 1 day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visit 3:<br>
--Timing: Day 30<br>
-- Visit Window: +/- 2 days</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These relative timings have to be abstracted (as opposed to being represented as a date) because each subject in a clinical trial will start at different points in time (e.g., Subject 1 starts on May 1st; Subject 2 starts on August 5th).</p>
<p>Question: Has anybody figured out how to store this info in PlanDefinition? The needs on the app we're working on are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to store which visit (PlanDefinition.Action) is the "anchor" visit (the one against which the others are timed)</li>
<li>Need to store the relative timing value and units</li>
<li>Need to store the visit window value and units.</li>
</ul>
