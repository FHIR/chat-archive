<p>Hi all - I have heard many implementers lament about getting to the bottom of a thread.  Especially those of us who hang out in committers thread.    I learned yesterday that the "End" key will take you there.  For those of you who already knew this, you can go back to your original programming now and sorry for the interruption.</p>

<p>Another approach is to click the three vertical dots next to the stream/thread name, choose "Mark all messages as read" and then click on the name again -- which also brings you to the bottom (and marks all as read).  This works for thread <em>or</em> entire streams.</p>
