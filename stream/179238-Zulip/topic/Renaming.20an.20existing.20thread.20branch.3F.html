<p>Is it possible to back up and rename a branch that already has a slew of new messages?  Or would that require manually renaming each post?  (If we did that, would it become a new thread, or just a bunch of posts with coincidentally the same subject?</p>

<p>Admins can do that - though I don't know how far back we can go.  When renaming a post, we can either rename a single post or all following.  What do you need fixed?</p>

<p>It's in the "HIMSS definition of interop" thread, but I'm not asking for anything now - just wondering about the drift to:</p>
<ul>
<li>HL7 definition of interop"</li>
<li>Can legit interop include a required proprietary component?</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, no action required right now - I just try to be a good boy re thread hygiene, and I realized I had the question.</p>
