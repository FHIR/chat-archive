<p>I have a tracker that complains that my differential contains stuff that is unchanged from the base.  These are mostly min max and type that is repeated.  I am reluctant to go through dozens of profiles to scrub them out partly since I think is a waste of my time and partly because I think its useful for me when I edit the diff to see these elements.   I had assumed that the publisher dims out the element if they are unchanged from the base.  In other words if min = 0  and max ='1' in both the profile diff and the base the tree view min max would be dimmed out.  Has this been discussed before? Anyway I think it should be dimmed -mostly  so I don't get any more trackers :-)</p>

<p>Right now, the validator highlights whatever is in the differential.  It doesn't check against the base to see if it's different.  (Making things even more fun, if authoring using spreadsheets, sometimes declaring the type is mandatory even if unchanged to allow other elements (e.g. pattern) to be declared.</p>

<p>From my point of view as a consumer, the differential <em>is</em> what's changed, and if there's something in there that hasn't changed, well, it shouldn't be in there. I understand if that's not actually works, but as a reader of an IG, that's my expectation.</p>

<p>right now, I know what isn't in the differential, because I copied it across. In order to change the rendering, I'd have to add logic to decide whether the content that is present is different. Some times, for things like strings, that'll be easy. for other things... it's tricky.</p>

<p>Differentials contain content for 4 reasons:<br>
a) it's changed (obvious &amp; most common)<br>
b) it hasn't changed - but the profile author wants to ensure a constraint is enforced even if the underlying resource/profile changes.  E.g. current max is 1, but I want to enforce a max of 1 even if the parent changes<br>
c) some authoring tools (e.g. spreadsheet authoring) mandate certain elements are present even if unchanged<br>
d) some authors include content in their differential as reminders or because they forget to remove stuff that's unchanged from the base, or the base has evolved to match the differential and differential hasn't changed to reflect that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of those reasons, we don't really want to show stuff that's in category (c) or (d).  Ideally, we'd like these things to not appear in the differential at all.  Auto-stripping them would sort of be nice.  However, we can't really distinguish them from (b)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I think the first question we need to ask is - is (b) a real thing?  It's a theoretical possibility.  But I'm not aware of any situation where anyone's actually done this.  If it's not a practical reality, then "normalizing" the differential seems like a good thing to do.</p>
<p>On Grahame's other point, should we normalize other information - like ensuring that types are listed in the same order?  (Obviously only works where types are unchanged - if you start introducing profiles and have no idea what the underlying types are, retaining order isn't really feasible.)</p>

<p>One other display issue when experimenting with this. I noticed that the MS flags are not displayed if inherited in the diff.   I think that is important to expose just like cardinality, and type, even if inherited. Which is why I add em in if not showing up in the diff.</p>

<p>well that could be part of the WG discussion of  if and how to implement when review  possible options :<br>
1) the ig-pub changes the diff to be unique then the renders<br>
2) the ig-pub checks if diff  uniquie when  rendering</p>
<p>I don't have an opinion except that the source should be unchanged.</p>

<p>Diff should be rendered consistently - I'm definitely opposed to overrides.  If something should be displayed, it should always be displayed - it shouldn't be up to author whim.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As noted above, this is the way SUSHI operates, but it's also worth noting that there are some exceptions <em>required</em> by the IG Publisher.  For example, the <code>sliceName</code> element must be repeated in the differential if you constrain an inherited slice (even though you're not changing the sliceName).  And we just recently learned that although a slice "inherits" the constraints from its base, you <em>must</em> repeat constraints from the base in every slice in order for the validator to work correctly.</p>
<p>So... if we were to suggest that differentials should only contain true differences, then we should also document the exceptions that require inclusion of non-different data due to limitations in the tooling.  (Actually, we should probably document those anyway).</p>

<p>Should the tooling not do it's best to create a pure differential? As SUSHI is doing now. I think that the eld-1, that is incorrectly triggered, should be silenced here.</p>
