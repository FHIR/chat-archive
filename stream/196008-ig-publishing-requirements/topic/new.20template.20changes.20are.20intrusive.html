<p>I don't recall discussing or  approving these changes. Can we electively suppress? These are only going to lead to more trackers that we (US Core) will be burden with.</p>

<p>The examples tab has been part of the templates for a <em>very</em> long time.  There was a bug in the publisher recently corrected that, for a time, was causing the linkage between examples and their profiles to not be exposed properly.  That's been fixed.</p>
<p>You absolutely shouldn't suppress.  Examples being in tabs is consistent with how things are rendered in core.  We <em>don't</em> want to depend on IG authors remembering to explicitly list the examples in their hand-authored documentation for a given profile.</p>

<p>OK I removed our example content the transition is not that bad. .. but why the redundancy with a tab AND the comma separated list ,  why not one or the other  ( I prefer inline ).  Also what the heck does </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Refer to this Resource Profile:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>mean?   </p>
<p>We are likely to get commenters questioning this?</p>

<p>The new "cross references" piece is new.  It was discussed on the calls over a course of several weeks.  You are correct that the fact it includes examples is somewhat problematic - and the fact that the example lists differ is also problematic.  We should discuss next Tuesday.</p>

<p>I think the "Refer to" phrasing is a little terse and confusing (and I seem to recall discussing that). Is it other artefacts that this profile refers to, or other artefacts referring to this profile?</p>
