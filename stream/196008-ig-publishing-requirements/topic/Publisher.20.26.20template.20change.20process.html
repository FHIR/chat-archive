<p>The draft process for making changes to the HL7 FHIR IG Publisher that affect the appearance of IGs or the authoring actions of IG creators, as well as changes to the IG templates that are maintained by HL7 (including the base template, the HL7 template, the product family templates and the HL7 accelerator templates) can be found here: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIRI/Publisher-impacting+Change+Process">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIRI/Publisher-impacting+Change+Process</a></p>
<p>We'll be discussing these changes on our regular call on Tuesday, 6 Eastern.  Discussion and feedback also welcome here on Zulip.  After a few iterations, we'll be seeking feedback and approval for these processes from the various management groups and possibly others.</p>

<p>This proposal assumes there will be only a single, rolling release. Has it been considered whether different releases (with different release branches) may need to be maintained? I think an example may be IGs against R4 vs IGs against R5 or R5+ might need to look/be built differently.</p>

<p>A rolling release can be difficult to track -- did you consider a set release 1-2 times a year? I haven't been tracking super close, but I would hope the design would stabilize</p>

<p>Given the backlog of requested changes (and limited volunteer resources), I wouldn't expect stabilization for a couple of years.  The less frequent the 'official' resources, the more you'll lose in terms of new functionality if you have to move back to a prior release.</p>

<p>I don't have any specific requirements for different versions. One thing that may benefit from the existence of different versions is  that there are IGs that are based on a specific FHIR version, have their own stable version, and I see no need for them to be updated with new publisher or template changes. AFAIK, currently any change to the IGPublisher (and I assume to the templates) is applied to al existing IGs.</p>

<p>In terms of number, to me it's about engagement -- if you want a broad community to review, less releases with fixed review times is better IMHO. The continuous potential change is quite hard to engage unless you make it a full time part of someone's role -- and I suspect most IG publishers don't have time to.</p>

<p>definitely a tradeoff, and a tradeoff that we are right now trying to predict the importance of the future. If that future issue is something like the need to change an icon or footer for an urgent trademark or copyright reason; doing it universally and fast is important. If it is adjusting the shade of red, less important.</p>

<p>I fully expect the "norm" will be ignorance until after something is deemed by someone as bad (e.g. like the pre/next change). This doesn't seem optimal, but I think it is the "norm" given that we are all very much focused in our own little world most of the time.</p>

<p>The proposed process should ensure that changes are publicly surfaced with opportunity for feedback before they're implemented.  Those who have strong feelings on what IGs should/shouldn't look like would be expected to monitor that as it's inefficient to only get feedback once something has been implemented and rolled out, many IGs are already using it, and at the end of the year, someone says "I don't like this, roll it back".  The evaluation of proposed changes and evaluation of changed design is, by definition, going to be continuous.  The release into 'current' is to give some experience with a wider range of IGs so that if there are implementation issues, they can be identified and addressed.  Doing an 'official' release is to set the expectation that everyone should now be using the new thing.</p>

<p>I think the intention is that majority of everyone uses current... but if you are building an old spec, you will likely want to build using the template version that was use back originally.. and I point out that if you used current back then, you would not necessarly know which version was used. Clearly if you always use a versioned template then it is known, as it is in your configuration files checked into your github; but then you are not taking advantage of current</p>

<p>The CI build is locked to 'current' publisher.  We'd need a good reason to change that.  And occasionally, the publisher is locked to external interface changes (package server, terminology server, etc.)  So even if you might want to use an old publisher, that might no longer be possible.</p>

<p>If we had a strong reason to publish using an old publisher, we might be able to make it happen sometimes, but it's unlikely to ever be the default behavior.</p>

<p>I was not expecting the ci build to do that.. I was thinking of the process used to create a formal publication, which is local build.</p>
