<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196359">@Robert Dieterle</span> is there an endpoint, CAQH or other, that we can hit to start identifying Payer endpoints for the Patient Access API?  I know they're supposed to be readily and publicly available on the respective websites but are sometimes difficult to find.</p>

<p>Yes, you can use the CAQH Payer endpoint directory to obtain endpoints for payers that are participating in that directory effort.  Some of the payers are choosing to make the endpoint information available on their website.</p>

<p>I do not believe <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196359">@Robert Dieterle</span> CAQH has made their payer directory endpoints publicly available. This informational splash page has been all I could find for the last year. <a href="https://www.caqh.org/solutions/early-participants">https://www.caqh.org/solutions/early-participants</a> Is there a publicly available site somewhere that I'm missing that includes the payer endpoint information? CARIN has put up a free, publicly accessible directory that's crowd-sourced but it only has a handful of payers in it. <a href="https://carinfhirdirectory.com/">https://carinfhirdirectory.com/</a></p>
