<p>GTRI has moved all of our artifacts for MortalityReporting into it's own github organization: <a href="https://github.com/MortalityReporting" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/MortalityReporting">https://github.com/MortalityReporting</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, we have completed local testing on the java implementation of the revised VRDR IG, and created a release you can find here: <a href="https://github.com/MortalityReporting/VRDR_javalib/releases/tag/v0.1.0-REVISED-BETA" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/MortalityReporting/VRDR_javalib/releases/tag/v0.1.0-REVISED-BETA">https://github.com/MortalityReporting/VRDR_javalib/releases/tag/v0.1.0-REVISED-BETA</a> if you need to update your library immediately, I would recommend downloading and building this new release. However, we have not tested against canary yet, so I have labelled the release as "BETA" to denote that there could be some validation errors to come. If you find any issues, feel free to email me directly, or create an issue on the github project here: <a href="https://github.com/gt-health/VRDR_javalib/issues/new" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/gt-health/VRDR_javalib/issues/new">https://github.com/gt-health/VRDR_javalib/issues/new</a> I'll receive the issue, and will resolve it with you.</p>
