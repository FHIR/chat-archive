<p>Thanks for providing the recap <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="462757">@Bontu Fitta</span> ! </p>
<p>Some notes on the bulk messaging conversation:</p>
<p>Because we want to minimize the confusion between the current IJE approach of "batch processing" and the ability to submit multiple messages at once using FHIR, we're trying to use the term "bulk" to cover the concept of POSTing multiple messages with a single connection. Here's how we're defining the terms:</p>
<p>"Batch" refers to the IJE approach of handling and processing records in batches, so that a batch of records is always processed and moved together and a record is always tied to one particular identifiable "batch".</p>
<p>"Bulk" refers to the capability of moving multiple FHIR messages with a single connection (possibly using the Bulk FHIR standard), where the messages are not tied together for processing, don't need to relate to each other in any way, and are handled individually. For example, a single "bulk" message POST can include a variety of different messages and even message types, and the responses to that POST can appear across multiple GET requests.</p>
