<p>Dear NVSS Modernization COP Members :</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in participating in the NCHS organized testing event January 24-25th, 2022  either as a tester or an observer.  This event will focus on testing the NVSS FHIR<br>
API, NVSS API Client Reference Implementation  and bidirectional flow using STEVE 2.0. </p>
<p>As mentioned, we will be using the NVSS COP Office Hours on January 4, 11, 18, 2022 to prepare for this event (4 to 5pm ET).  You should have received an invite for the 2022 <br>
Office Hours weekly meetings. If not, please send a note to <a href="mailto:NVSSmodernizaton@cdc.gov">NVSSmodernizaton@cdc.gov</a> and we will make sure and send it to you. We request that you have technical staff from your VRO<br>
and/or vendor organization responsible for this testing activity attend the weekly prep calls. Attached is the meeting agenda.  </p>
<p>We will use the  Zulip FHIR Chat &gt; Death on FHIR stream ((32595) Death on FHIR - FHIR Community - Zulip) as our technical help desk portal leading up to and during the testing<br>
event. If you have any technical questions please pose them on Zulip FHIR chat.  Someone from our technical team will get back to you within 24-48 hours. </p>
