<p>Note that, within the Death Record Inspector, Canary is seeing a "Mortician Family Name" of "Sam Jones, MD"; the file does not appear to actually have a value for the Mortician (aka Funeral Director) field, and even the "How Canary interpreted your input" section is blank. Where is Canary getting the "Sam Jones, MD" information that it's displaying? Is there perhaps some field name overlap, since "Sam Jones, MD" appears as a name in other parts of the file? <a href="/user_uploads/10155/KRe9Pcr90-pU8garxj7kjwU4/Janet_Page_86759-20210528-fhir-1.json">Janet_Page_86759-20210528-fhir-1.json</a></p>

<p>You are correct that no Mortician is specified in the file.<br>
As the IG is currently specified, there is no positive indicator of the presence of a mortician.  The meta.profile is currently optional.   If a Mortician profile is not found, the VRDR .NET library that is used by Canary implies the presence of the Mortician as the the first Practitioner resource in the bundle that is not the Certifier.</p>
<p>As is shown by this example, that doesn't always work correctly.   We have submitted an issue against the Implementation Guide to reflect this weakness.   <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32957">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32957</a></p>
