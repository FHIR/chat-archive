<p>Access granting to the NVSS API?<br>
Ideally it should be the person that's going to be doing the hands on development for the States/Jurisdictions, and then one person may be from the program side, so up to two people from each state. Participants will need to go through Sam's account to get access to the NVSS API. <br>

</li>
<li>
<p>NCHS is requesting 2 states to work with us in 2022 to work towards FHIR certification by Dec 2022. If interested send a note to the NVSS Mail Box</p>
</li>
<li>Main focus of the March COP meeting will be on interoperability between ME/C case management systems and EDRS . States are requested to invite participants from the ME/C community to the event.</li>
