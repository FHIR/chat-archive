<p><strong>Status Update of VRDR FHIR IG, Messaging IG and Tool Set (Package Release Date - mid-April 2022)</strong></p>
<p>Several jurisdictions have reached out and requested an update about  the status of the VRDR IG and corresponding tools and when they will be stable enough to start development efforts. We understand the importance of having a close to final  and stable VRDR FHIR IG s to avoid the potential of rework and improve overall efficiencies. We are excited to share some important updates that you can factor in as you start working towards your modernization goals:</p>
<p>NCHS in collaboration with its technical partners has been working diligently to update the VRDR STU2 and FHIR Messaging Implementation guides, along with all associated software (canary, VRDR dotnet, etc) in time for the next testing event in late June 2022. Both IGs are in final review.  The VRDR STU2 has completed ballot reconciliation. We are dotting the i's and crossing the t's on the VRDR IG, so its current state should be very close to the version that will be published as STU2.  There has been significant addition of documentation within each profile related to the IJE elements. For example see Decedent profile.  </p>
<p>NCHS expects to release the IGs and associated software around mid-April 2022. This version will be very close to final. If you use this version for your development efforts as it stands today, we do not expect the need for significant rework. </p>
<p>We invite your feedback on the latest builds of the two IGs and look forward to ongoing collaboration(s), <br>
If you have any questions about the IG(s), please send them to Cynthia Bush at <a href="mailto:pdz1@cdc.gov">pdz1@cdc.gov</a> or Alaina Gregory at <a href="mailto:agj7@cdc.gov">agj7@cdc.gov</a></p>
