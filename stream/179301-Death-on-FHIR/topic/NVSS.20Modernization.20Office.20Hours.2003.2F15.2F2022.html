<p><strong>Topics covered during meeting</strong><br>
1.  Announcement about the availability of updated version of the VRDR IG and associated tools <br>
a.  NCHS in collaboration with its technical partners has been working diligently to update the VRDR STU2 (<a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/vrdr/artifacts.html">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/vrdr/artifacts.html</a> ) and FHIR Messaging (<a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/nightingaleproject/vital_records_fhir_messaging_ig/branches/main/">http://build.fhir.org/ig/nightingaleproject/vital_records_fhir_messaging_ig/branches/main/</a> ) Implementation guides, along with all associated software (canary, VRDR dotnet, etc) in time for the next testing event in late June 2022. Both IGs are in final review. The VRDR STU2 has completed ballot reconciliation. We are dotting the i's and crossing the t's on the VRDR IG, so its current state should be very close to the version that will be published as STU2. There has been significant addition of documentation within each profile related to the IJE elements. For example see Decedent profile (<a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/vrdr/branches/master/StructureDefinition-vrdr-decedent.html#usage">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/vrdr/branches/master/StructureDefinition-vrdr-decedent.html#usage</a> ).<br>

5.  Should the office hours be offered only twice a month vs. weekly?<br>
