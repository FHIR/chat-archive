<p>I imagine that a single KA repository could be used by many consumers of data as well as  many backend service clients.  If that is the case will there be guidance on how to scope what backend service clients have access to different PlanDefnitions or how a consumer could restrict which backend clients it wants to receive data from. Or the opposite, how a backend service client could filter out plan definitions that it did not want to send data for?    Or is this considered out of scope ?</p>
