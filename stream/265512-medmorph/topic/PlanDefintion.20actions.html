<p>In the PlanDefnition profile the valueset used to define actions is extensible.  Is there a methodology defined for how codes defined outside of this valueset would be computable by an arbitrary backend service client?  For example, lets say I have a registry that generates it's own identifier for a patient and the data is expected to use this identifier when submitting.  Is there a way to define the process in a computable form that a backend client could simply process and use or would it be expected that any implementation would need to be out of band of the PlanDefnition processing, ie.. handcoded?</p>
