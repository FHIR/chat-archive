<p>As the IG is leveraging the auth mechanism defined in the SMART Bulk data IG will there be any guidance on client registration?   From my understanding the PlanDefnitions will contain a location to send the data too.  If a backend service client is supposed to be able to send data to arbitrary endpoints defined in any of the PlanDefintions that it loads in a dynamic fashion that backend client will need to be registered at the with the location it is sending data too.  Is how the registration takes place out of scope or will dynamic client registration be expected?</p>
