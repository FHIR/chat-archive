<p>Currently, the codeset for resource Immunization consists of in-progress | on-hold | completed | entered-in-error | stopped.  <br>
I would like to request adding a new code "Override" to this codeset, we need this code to cover scenario like the following:<br>
An immunization was given before the child’s first birthday and the forecaster deemed it as "invalid" based on the calculation of the dates, but the HA still recognizes it as valid because it was only off by one day so they would override it from invalid to valid.<br>
Any comments to my request?  Please advise, thanks.</p>

<p>This isn't a Canada-specific question, so I'd recommend raising it on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="4" href="/#narrow/stream/4-implementers">#implementers</a>.  That said, the Immunization.status has nothing to do with whether the Immunization is deemed valid or not.  That's handled by ImmunizationEvaluation.  Override would be  dose status reason</p>
