<p>Hi, I'm just reading up on SMART on FHIR to see how this might fit into my company in the future. Are there people here who have built apps for their EHR? If so, could I connect and learn more about what you did, and how that went?</p>
<p>Also, I was curious if the vision is to one day have a general "App Store" where anyone can grab a SMART on FHIR app, and use it in their health system. I see this gallery (<a href="https://apps.smarthealthit.org/apps/featured">https://apps.smarthealthit.org/apps/featured</a>) but also see that there are multiple "App Stores" like Epic's App Orchard, Cerner's, etc. </p>
<p>Just wanted to better understand real life examples and also thoughts on app stores / app ecosystems.</p>
