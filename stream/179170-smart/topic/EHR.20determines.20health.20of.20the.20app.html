<p>As an app distributor, I lack visibility in the EHR's ability to reach the app.  Firewalls, configuration activities, EHR version upgrades, etc., can all make my app unusable or unreachable to the EHR.  </p>
<p>It would be great if the EHR could have a consistent way to check that the app is healthy from the EHR's perspective.  I would think two standardized approaches to this could be:</p>
<p>1) to add a test aspect to the app's launch URL, allowing the EHR to call this known URL but have the result be related to health instead of an authorize request.  This would allow the app to check that it can reach back to the EHR's FHIR metadata, discover the auth URL, then verify that it can reach the auth server.<br>
2) add a new "health" url to the app that simply returns an HTTP 200 with up or down status</p>
