<p>Does there exist any api call back or response as part of the SMART standard which provides the logged in user information, mainly the operational roles info like 'admin' etc. <br>
Of course there exist a standard endpoint  'GET /connect/userinfo' which will give the above info but this end point is currently not supported by most of the SMART auth servers</p>

<p>We haven't profiled the use of any specific API endpoint for this -- but for our basic "single sign on" use case, the access token response includes an id_token with a <code>fhirUser</code> claim, which is a URL; a client can follow that URL to fetch a resource with details about that user, whether it is a Patient, Practitioner, RelatedPerson, or other person. In other words, we generally prefer to use the fhir API to accomplish this.</p>

<p>In this particular case, is the FHIR resource pointed at by the <code>fhirUser</code> claim the appropriate place to communicate this information?  My understanding is it isn't because a concept like 'admin user' is out of scope for FHIR.  So it should be put in a separate openid connect claim, outside of what SMART has defined.  But I'd like to know if I'm wrong here.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192576">@Robert Scanlon</span> you're not wrong here. Still, while the kind of info you might find by following links from Practitioner --&gt; PractitionerRole and looking at <code>PractitionerRole.code</code>aren't <em>security/user roles</em>, they certainly can be "operational roles info", which was the initial question.</p>
