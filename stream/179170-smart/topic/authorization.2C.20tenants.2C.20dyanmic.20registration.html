<p>I currently have a different fhir "base url" per tenant. different authorization requirements for patient vs ehr-user seems to make it necessary to have _two_ base urls per tenant. Sure would be fantastic if the spec supported multiple "security metadatas" instead of one (eg: user vs system vs patient) -- for cases like mine where there is just one resource server, but multiple authorization endpoints.</p>
<p>I am also trying to support dynamic registration. I'm having trouble navigating this... it seems that the idea is that the client finds out about the auth server via the metadata / well-known endpoints. How did the client find out about those endpoints??</p>
<p>Curious if others have one client registration that works among its tenants, or are client credentials managed on a per tenant basis?</p>

<p>You can have multiple tenants (FHIR end points) sharing the same authorization server, but not vice-versa</p>

<p>It is really one end point: the FHIR one - and the client must know it from some internal configuration or setup, there is no discovery mechanism</p>

<p>In SMART, the FHIR server endpoint is sent to the app (the iss) if it is launched. The app <em>should</em> still whitelist it, but that is the "discovery" today that exists. Standalone apps typically configure this in some way.</p>
