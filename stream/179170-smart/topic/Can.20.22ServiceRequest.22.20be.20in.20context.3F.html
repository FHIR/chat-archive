<p>From what I read when launching SoF apps it seems that it is always based on the context of the patient or encounter resource. Is there ever a concept of being in the context of a specific ServiceRequest/ReferralRequest?</p>
<p>(I ask as I'm trying to build an eReferral SoF app, which has 3 modes: 1) submit an eReferral, 2) view a patient's referrals, 3) view and update a specific referral at the referral destination via a SoF app.</p>
<p>1) can be done with a patient context, but could also leverage a ServiceRequest context if the referral is started in the EMR, 2) is fine with just patient context, 3) requires a ServiceRequest context. </p>
<p>Is it reasonable to pursue an idea of a ServiceRequest context, or should I just assume that will never be a thing?</p>

<p>it's very reasonable to pursue. there'll be lots of contexts - anywhere where you have a user, and what to help them</p>
