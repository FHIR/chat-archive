<p>I'm working on a short panel presentation and I'd like a few slides on SMART on FHIR.  I could develop them myself, but I'm betting there might already be some slides out there licensed under Creative Commons.  Can anyone point me to some (preferably recent-ish)?</p>

<p>We keep links to our evergreen decks at <a href="http://bit.ly/smart-fhir-tech">bit.ly/smart-fhir-tech</a> (you're welcome to reuse these under CC-BY and I can add an explicit copyright slide if/where helpful.</p>

<p>Thanks, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>!  Google docs is blocked on my work network, but I'll check it out once I get off the VPN!  As for licensing, I think an explicit slide would be helpful for people who stumble on the slides and aren't sure of the licensing restrictions (and helpful for proving to legal/communications departments that the slides can be legally re-used).</p>

<p>Great. I added a license statement + link at the entry page above. Can add slides too.</p>

<p>Awesome.  I actually was excited to see the slides, so I popped off VPN just now and saw you typing in the license statement in real time.  This is where the magic happens.  Thanks, Josh!</p>
