<p>Posting a question just in case anyone has gone down this path and has insights to share:</p>
<p>Currently working on a provider-facing SoF application where we need to augment the client and current-user (provider) with licensing and training-completion data in order to determine the correct content for the user. We can create a mapping of clients using the iss and users by requesting the profile / fhirid and are currently looking at storing this additional licensing and training information in an external data store.</p>
<p>Just curious if anyone else has gone down this path and has any lessons learned / hints / warnings to share.</p>

<p>No specific experience with this -- but the options generally are to store data back in the system of record, or in your own app db. The latter has the advantages that it's in your control (many EHRs don't support most writes), and that you might share this kind of licensing or training-completion data across systems (e.g., if the same physician uses your app in different settings).</p>
