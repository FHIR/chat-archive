<p>New here and new to FHIR.  I have some questions about how to implement a health certificate for COVID-19 PCR test results as a Verifiable Credential.</p>
<p>By way of background, my company NextID is working on the Safe Travel project in Singapore (<a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/pdt-digital-certification">https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/pdt-digital-certification</a>).  We are adding a feature to our NextCert issuance application to support HealthCerts which use FHIR syntax, much like the Health Cards example (<a href="https://healthwallet.cards/credential-modeling">https://healthwallet.cards/credential-modeling</a>).  These certs will record the result of a COVID-19 PCR test based on a nasalpharyngeal swab.  The presentation layer will display the result as 'positive/negative/inconclusive/invalid'.</p>
<p>The sample certificate given in the specification (not to be confused with a JSON schema) has capability for recording the clinical lab result as a text string such as 'negative'.  But we feel that the certificate should be more informative and include also the Ct (cycle time), igG and igM (2 types of antibody) in the certificate data, whether or not is shown in the presentation layer.  Here is a snippet from the observation block of the sample cert as shown in the specification document:</p>
<p>{<br>
            "resourceType": "Observation",<br>
            "identifier": [{<br>
                "value": "123456789",<br>
                "type": "ACSN"<br>
            }],<br>
            "code": {<br>
                "coding": [{<br>
                    "system": "<a href="http://loinc.org">http://loinc.org</a>",<br>
                    "code": "94531-1",<br>
                    "display": "Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test"<br>
                }]<br>
            },<br>
            "valueCodeableConcept": {<br>
                "coding": [{<br>
                    "system": "<a href="http://snomed.info/sct">http://snomed.info/sct</a>",<br>
                    "code": "260385009",<br>
                    "display": "Negative"<br>
                }]<br>
            }</p>
<p>I'm not sure if the only value we need to make dynamic is the valueCodeableConcept display.  It seems from what I've read that the code number also changes if the result is other than negative.  Aside from this point, my primary question is, how would we add the fields to capture Ct, igG and igM and what is the data type to be captured (eg- are they text, integer values or scientific notation)?</p>

<p>No apologies needed.  This forum is a big place.  The recommendation was more about where you might find more people with the right expertise paying attention.  Unfortunately, we can't move posts.  You'd have to re-ask the question elsewhere.  Normally asking the same question in multiple places is frowned upon, but it's fine if someone suggests you post elsewhere (and best practice is to include a link on the old discussion to the new discussion so those late to the party can see where things moved to.</p>

<p>sorry, about the confusion on where to post. This is getting into details about modeling specific lab results, but briefly: I would think about capturing these kinds of attributes of a test as components of an observation, via <code>Observation.component</code>.</p>

<p>I would be happy to work with you on writing out some examples that we could make public, if you like. Oftentimes the process of doing this translation reveals areas of ambiguity or mapping details that we will need to work through.</p>

<p>Right now, "presentation context" is a way of shaping what details the issuer should include in a Health Card; it's not <em>necessarily</em> a field baked in to the VC itself.</p>

<p>We've been thinking about removing "presentation context" as a concept from the spec altogether, to focus on one "primary" use case initially -- a use case that includes a pretty rich set of details in the issued card.</p>

<p>In this QR scheme, we can resolve DIDs by linked domains  (.well-known/did-configuration) and/or trust framework-hosted registries; the suffix data is always verifiable, since the short-form DID is calculated by hashing this data.</p>

<p>Got it – yeah, re: "we are not going to introduce a hard dependency on sidetree nodes in v1 of Health Cards)." what's the thinking there? Just that the ION nodes are perhaps too immature at this point or that the infra requirements are too much to get started? Some other thoughts/concerns (which may or may not be warranted, just thinking out loud):</p>
<ul>
<li>Is supporting a QR-able flavor of a VC (distinct from a general Health Card) too much complexity for issuers? I imagine this would be another VC type with it's own schema, so perhaps not, but it's still definitely "more stuff to support" for issuers.</li>
<li>It feels a bit against the grain of sidetree-based DID methods to have a, effectively, a closed network, of DID resolution. At least, that's my gut impression -- would love to learn more about what you thinking there.</li>
<li>To play out how .well-known/did-configuration.json plays a role here, is the following correct. QR VC includes short-form DID and DID origin -&gt; verifier/holder resolves origin's well-known/did-configuration.json domain linkage VC -&gt; check that short-form DID in VC matches long-form DID in domain linkage VC -&gt; if check passes, resolve long-form DID in domain linkage VC to DID Document (local res; not DLT) -&gt; verify signature of VC using signing key in DID Document.<ul>
<li>This assumes that the DID @ .well-known/did-configuration.json is long-form, but perhaps that's a fair assumption</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It's just  early; it raises questions for instance about whether DIDs need to be public (for issuers, they are; for users, that's another story, and by simply avoiding ledger-backed DIDs for now, we avoid those questions).</p>

<p>Yes doing something (anything!) specific for QRs is more work for issuers -- but it's a core part of the problem we're committed to solving, given the importance of supporting users without a smartphone. There are trade-offs, but we want to develop the best system we can.</p>

<p>For sure :) – I haven't dug too deeply yet, but I would hope that there's some specification for "concatenating many QR codes together", so that a data-rich VC could be encoded via 2/3 QR codes without any modification to the VC payload - of course that would be only be useful if QR scanners/libs implement said spec. If of interest and not done already, I would be happy to do some research there.</p>

<p>Thanks -- I haven't done any research in this regard, and would love to know what's out there. (E.g. in scanning multiple codes, presumably you'd need to ensure you weren't order-dependent, so each chunk would need to embed its own index an the total set size.)</p>

<p>On scanning multiple QR codes, there is a specification for it; my exploration so far has found exactly one library that implements it.  I haven't spent too much time looking, but I'm not too confident in it either.</p>

<p>Trying to take in the documentation here, and related specs.. and make sure I've connected all of the dots correctly.  Say I'm taking on the perspective of an issuer.  The user has given a VC I've issued to a holder.  Some time later, the holder presents the VC I issued to a verifier...</p>
<p>I wasn't totally clear on interactions between the verifier and the issuer; or, perhaps the verifier only deals w/ the holder.  I do think that the verifier does have some interaction w/ the issuer... in <a href="http://healthwallet.cards">healthwallet.cards</a> docs, this bit stuck out to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Verifiers will discover public keys associated with an issuer via .well-known DID URLs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sequence diagram, "Complete the Presentation", has a note joining the the holder and the verifier "Verify VC" and subsequent operations on the verifier participant "extract issuers did and resolve".. then another operation titled just "...". </p>
<p>Switching gears quite a bit, I was reading about "Status" and "Revocation" (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#status">https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#status</a>).  I'm interested in bolstering my mental model on this subject as it relates to healthcards.  Say, for example, an immunization resource is "entered-in-error".  How will the VC's status be updated w/ the holder?</p>
<p>I'll probably need to read through all of the specs involved (DID, VC) a few more times before everything really "clicks"..</p>

<p>Re: updates, we're not currently planning to support updates to a Health Card; they're designed to cover (more or less) immutable clinical facts. This isn't perfect, but neither is vaccine protection; if I give you a card with information that turns out to be incorrect... you can still show that card to people. Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The holder can always go request new cards from the issuer, so if there's a change to the data that the holder <em>desires</em>, they can obtain and use a new health card. But if the holder <em>wants</em> to keep sharing the old one, that's a threat we don't try to mitigate.</li>
<li>If an issuer's keys are compromised, the issuer may decide to revoke them in a way that may invalidate health cards (e.g., from a particular date range) -- so at the time of validation when a verifier goes to determine "is this signature valid," they may decide "no, the associated key isn't trustworthy". This isn't quite what you're asking about, but has some similar properties.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes. If the request only specifies <code>#covid19</code>, the response's <code>vc.type</code> should include all of <code>#health-card</code>, <code>#covid19</code>, and <code>#immunization</code>, or should it only include the types that were requested?</p>

<p>If the request includes type X, then all responses should include type X (in addition to the other types needed to describe them).

<p>The core Health Cards spec only describes bare keys in a jwks.json file. (We're interested in developing guidance for linking out to certs as well, as part of trust framework options -- but that's something we'd layer on top; discovery bare keys should always work.)</p>

<p>I am reading the health card IG and would like to clarify how the .well-known endpoint is constructed: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Issuers SHALL publish keys as JSON Web Key Sets (see RFC7517), available at &lt;&lt;iss value from Signed JWT&gt;&gt; + .well-known/jwks.json.</p>
<p>The URL at &lt;&lt;iss value from Signed JWT&gt;&gt; SHALL NOT include a trailing /.

<p>I don't quite understand how this works</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any JWS longer than 1195 characters is split into "chunks" of length 1191 or smaller; each chunk is then encoded as a separate QR code to ensure ease of scanning. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this mean that after scanning the initial QR code, the second one pops up automatically? I have never seen this before. Is there any reference to the requirement (about the subsequent codes) and real world implementations?</p>

<p>To be clear, we look at multi-QR Health Cards as an exceptional case / escape hatch; generally health cards are expected to fit in a single QR, and if we find this isn't the case, we may want to re-work the way we encode data to be more efficient.</p>

<p>A couple of us from the Health Cars / VCI crew participated in the WHO process gathering input. A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WHO scope it is broad compared with the scope for SMART Health Cards. It includes continuity of care use cases in addition to proof of vaccination, and because of this, it assumes there will be a centralized national database that each public health authority makes available for queries from authorized users or outside jurisdictions. In Health Cards, we are entirely focused on giving individuals a copy of their own data in a verifiable format, with a workflow that allows paper-based or electronic presentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "RC1" doc from the WHO does not yet include recommendations from the ethics workstream; I'm looking forward to seeing these land in a subsequent revision.</p>

<p>So, I've been piecing a Vaccine Wallet/Passport together also, but I've been taking a slightly different approach, since we're using Apple Health Records.  We get the Immunization records raw, which I can generate a QR code with.  So, for instance, if you take out your phone, and scan the following code, you should get a FHIR Immunization record for Candace Salinas.</p>

<p>Hi Richard,<br>
Once the data gets to the patient, it's their choice to share the data freely and publicly if they wish.  The security aspects are primarily required when dealing with somebody else's data.  The auto-opening in Safari is maybe not desired, but the intent was to demonstrate that FHIR resources can be shared via QR codes.  Also, there may be interest in sharing FHIR resources insecurely as a Receipt function.</p>
<p>Also, I added the security components in during the connectathon and in another stream.  You're continuing a conversation from early in the implementation and connectathon.</p>
