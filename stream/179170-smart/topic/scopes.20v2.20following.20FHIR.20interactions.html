<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191325">@Dunmail</span> quick follow-up from the Q&amp;A after my SMART presentation Tuesday. I think you'd asked about why we don't more directly follow the FHIR interaction model in our proposed scope system. I wanted to highlight that 1) we do map very closely, providing FHIR resources + interactions + (optionally) search params restricting the grant ,and 2) the main place where we "add" something is our <code>user/</code> and <code>patient/</code> prefixes, which don't directly correspond to anything surfaced in the FHIR API, but which are useful in tying together a FHIR authorization with out-side-the-FHIR-realm rules about which records are accessible to which users. I hope this helps; I feel like I didn't answer this live as clearly as I could have.</p>
