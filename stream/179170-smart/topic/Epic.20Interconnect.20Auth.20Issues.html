<p>Not sure if anybody here could help, but I am attempting to connect to an institution's Epic Interconnect and it keeps failing with "invalid_grant" and "Invalid launch token". I am doing everything listed in the documentation and have tested thoroughly on Epic's Simulator and Smart Launcher. Everything works well there. I just can't get it to work on the institution's  Interconnect. </p>
<p>My questions is not necessarily what I am doing wrong but rather if this happening from the institution's Interconnect side or something from my end? I have talked to my Epic point of contact and keep constantly working with the institution to solve this issue with no success. Just looking to see if anybody has had a similar experience and could give some insight into how to solve this issue.</p>

<p>Hi Mateo, not a lot of information to go on here. I'd suggest reaching out to your AOTS or the AO Forums and provide an example http request to the /authorize endpoint. Maybe:</p>
<ul>
<li>confirm that you're using your non-prod client id with non-prod environments and your prod client id with prod environments.</li>
<li>your redirect_uri(s) are case-sensitive and must match explicitly (I think that even a trailing slash between what's registered with the auth server and what's in the querystring param will cause an error). </li>
<li>you have to request the launch scope in an EHR Launch</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two bullets would've been caught when testing, though.</p>
