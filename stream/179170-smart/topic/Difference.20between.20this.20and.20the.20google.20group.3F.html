<p>Is there a difference in purpose between this chat stream and the smart-on-fhir Google Group?  (It would be helpful if the purpose were stated in the stream's "description", if someone can do that.)</p>

<p>This is for live chat. The Google Group is a mailing list. they're both open for community discussion though.</p>
