<p>I have a couple of questions related to generation of a token when a Provider/User smart app is launched outside of EHR. If the app requires a patient context, is the expectation that the app calls the "authorize" endpoint (assuming we are going with Authorization Code grant type in the oAuth flow) with launch/patient scope and the authorization server displays the patient lookup screen after provider authentication? My other question is - how will the "authorize" endpoint know if a provider or patient login screen be displayed for authentication. In the SMART App Launcher test page, I saw that "login_type=provider" or "login_type=patient" is being used.  Thank you.</p>

<p>Yes, if <code>launch/patient</code> scope or other <code>patient/</code> scopes are requested. Handling this is part of the job of the "authorize" endpoint (i.e., knowing how to authenticate users, and knowing which users are allowed to access which records).</p>
