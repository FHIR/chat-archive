<p>Hi, We're investigating a use case where a SMART on FHIR application would want to trigger the launch of another SMART on FHIR application and include some additional launch context. The specific use case is a decision support application launching an application that sends referrals to a specialist provider, with the additional context being the type of referral etc. I can't seem to find this covered in the docs and was wondering if anyone has encountered a similar use case before or could point me to a relevant implementation guide?</p>

<p>In this scenario, do you want App A to play the role of the EHR with respect to App B? Or do you want App A to get the EHR that launched App A to then launch App B?</p>

<p>(If the former, this is possible, but an odd pattern. The latter could be done with a SMART Web Messaging activity.)</p>

<p>Thanks Josh! We would ideally like App A to request the EHR to launch App B since as you mention that is the more standardized approach. SMART Web Messaging looks promising, however its unlikely that the EMR's were integrating with will implement it anytime soon. Thanks again!</p>
