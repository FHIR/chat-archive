<p>In last week's SMART Web Messaging ballot issue reconciliation call, we looked at <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-29392">FHIR-29392</a>, which addressed the omission of guidance for the topic of data provenance in the balloted IG.  The proposal we landed on (<a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=104565559#SMARTWebMessagingBallotReconciliationCC20210219-Jira9b965702-34a7-3433-bf10-7f66fd69238cFHIR-29392">and voted for</a>) in the call was to defer provenance specification until a future version - so I prepared a <a href="https://github.com/HL7/smart-web-messaging/pull/45">pull request</a> that mentions provenance and that specification is considered for future use.</p>
<p>If anyone has suggestions for wording or edits - I'd appreciate the feedback!</p>

<p>Following up to my own thread - I think what we voted on was to Defer, but internally I was thinking of it like a Defer with Mod (which I don't think is a real thing).</p>
<p>So, I think the PR I created can be considered as a resolution for an as-yet issue.</p>
