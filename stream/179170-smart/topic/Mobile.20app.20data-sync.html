<p>Hi everyone, consider a mobile app for health workers (“practitioners”) that is supposed to work offline too but also synchronizes its data with a central FHIR server when online. Each practitioner should have access only to their patients but multiple practitioners might have access to the same patient. So syncing data works both ways. I am trying to see if the sync can be done through the SMART on FHIR (SoF) framework. Here are some questions which I hope the community here can help with:</p>
<ol>
<li>IIUC, the patient ID that is being accessed is not tied to the <code>access_token</code>. In other words, the app can get one access_token with some <code>patient/*.*</code> scopes and use the <em>same</em> token to access different patients, correct? OR is it necessary to get different tokens for each patient, if we use <code>patient/</code> scopes? </li>
<li>Now let’s assume that we want to use <code>user/</code> scopes instead. Is there any standard and/or recommendation on what a <code>user/</code> scope access means in terms of FHIR resources that can be read/written? Or is this completely left to the server to decide. For example, with <code>patient/</code> scopes, I think Patient Compartment is used to decide what resources can be accessed; is there any similar recommendation for <code>user/</code> scopes?</li>
<li>In general, does it make sense to use SoF for this sync problem? Has anyone else done anything similar to this through SoF that they can share?</li>
</ol>

<p>Practitioner apps usually use <code>user/</code> scopes. <code>user/*.read</code> (or <code>user/*.*</code>) give access to all resources, otherwise specific copes like <code>user/Patient.read user/Condition.read</code> can be used to give access to only specific resources</p>

<p>1) It's <em>possible</em> to use patient-level scopes and user-level scopes together in this same access token, but it's probably not a good fit for what you're talking about. If your goal is to have a practitioner accessing multiple patient records in an offline scenario, you'll probably want then to get an access token with just user-level scopes, since there won't be a single patient in-context across all these interactions.</p>
<p>2) You can define <code>user/Observation.read</code> in SMARTv1, or things like <code>user/Observation.cruds?category=...</code> in SMARTv2. Keep in mind that the actual rules about what the end-user is <em>allowed to do</em> live in a layer below SMART authorization; SMART just defines a delegation protocol for sharing a user's access with apps. See <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/smart-app-launch/scopes-and-launch-context.html#smarts-scopes-are-used-to-delegate-access">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/smart-app-launch/scopes-and-launch-context.html#smarts-scopes-are-used-to-delegate-access</a></p>
<p>3) SMART on FHIR will help with a piece of this problem (delegation to apps) but your authorization server and resource server still need some underlying way to know what roles and permissions each user has; SMART won't help with that part.</p>

<p>Thanks both for the quick responses. Yes, we are also inclined to use <code>user/</code> scopes. However, the reason we are still considering <code>patient/</code> scopes is that the underlying resource server has decent support for imposing access-controls for patient scopes which we like to get advantage of. So again, is it okay to fetch one access_token with some <code>patient/</code> scopes and reuse it with different patients?<br>
Also thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> for the link, that was useful. There are other interesting pieces in that version like separating search from read. How far is this newer version from being published as the new SoF spec?</p>

<p>No, that's not what patient Scopes means. Patient level Scopes are only relevant if you are requesting permissions about a single patient -- think of these as meaning "there is a single patient identified in the context of the launch and I want permissions on that record". If you don't have a single patient identified in the context of your launch, and patient level Scopes are not for you. (In my answer to question one above, I noted the technically patient level Scopes can be combined with user level Scopes -- and that is correct, but it does not accomplish what you are ooking for here.)</p>

<p>I see, thanks. Now let's consider a case that the practitioner wants to use the app for accessing data of a single patient only. It seems to me that the general flow is to ask for <code>launch/patient</code> scope and then during the authorization, the user goes through a "patient picker" step to choose the patient (since practitioner has access to many patients). But what if we exactly know which patient we need in advance (using the local data on the app)? Is it possible not to ask for <code>launch/patient</code> but later provide patient context when the app uses the issued <code>access_token</code>? OR is the access_token for a <code>patient/</code> scope supposed to be issued only when it is clear what the patient context is?</p>

<p>You are making things more complicated that they need to be. Just use <code>user/...</code> scopes, and have the practitioner select the patient they want from inside the app</p>

<p>The main reason I am still considering <code>patient/</code> scope is to benefit from the support that the resource server provides. Otherwise we need to implement a lot of access control rules on top of that (with <code>user/</code> scopes). With the <code>patient/</code> scope I can simply check if the practitioner is allowed to access information about that particular patient and then leave everything else (e.g., what are the FHIR search parameters used, etc.) to the resource server to deal with.</p>

<p>So just to close the loop here, I think the answer to my last question is that patient context has to be included in the access token as an extra claim. Previously, I was looking at some JWT access tokens with <code>patient/...</code> scopes but no patient claim in them (I think I know why now) which confused me. So to summarize, I think patient context has to be known when a patient scoped token is issued.</p>

<p>Correct, patient context must be known when a patient scoped token is issued. See for instance <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/smart-app-launch/scopes-and-launch-context.html#standalone-apps">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/smart-app-launch/scopes-and-launch-context.html#standalone-apps</a> --</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note on launch/patient: If an application requests a clinical scope which is restricted to a single patient (e.g. patient/*.rs), and the authorization results in the EHR granting that scope, the EHR SHALL establish a patient in context. The EHR MAY refuse authorization requests including patient/ that do not also include a valid launch/patient scope, or it MAY infer the launch/patient scope.</p>
