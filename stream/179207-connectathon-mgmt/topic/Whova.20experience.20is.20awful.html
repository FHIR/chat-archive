<p>We use <a href="https://discord.com/">https://discord.com/</a> a lot internally - i think, this tool would be ideal for connectathon - you will be able to walk between sessions. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span></p>

<p>Agree <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191318">@nicola (RIO/SS)</span>  that the Whova experience for joining sessions is painful.</p>
<p>The <em>agenda</em> feature is pretty useful for conferences like DevDays where you want to search talks/tracks. Discord is great but only addresses the "see a list of channels and join one" part of the problem, not schedule management. (This Discord workflow can also be approximated by publishing a wiki page with static links to track-specific Zoom or Jitsi meetings.)</p>

<p>Published zoom links make restricting access to only registrants more difficult, which matters for the financial viability of the event.</p>

<p>For discord, you can manage access to  it - the only discord problem - there is no video recording by default (but it can be plugged as a bot)</p>

<p>What's good about discord  - it will give us the filling of offline connectathon openspace - which i missed  :( Let's make a small experiment?</p>

<p>I think recruiting a few tracks/leads for this experiment would be great. (We did something similar within the SMART App Launch track with <a href="http://gather.town">gather.town</a>; but I think most of the value from Discord would be if there are multiple tracks using it. Discord chat would also probably draw activity away from the Zulip streams, which is not ideal but probably manageable. Whova and <a href="http://gather.town">gather.town</a> have pretty poor chat functionality, so its use is self limiting :))</p>

<p>For me the low hanging fruit is still: track leads just set up a persistent meeting (Zoom, Jitsi, whatever) leave it non-recorded, and encourage your participants to hang out there full time, so you can have little discussions there the way you would around a table,  etc.</p>

<p>around a table, it is clear who is listening. One can look at the attendee list, but hard to know who-is-who by names we have never seen before... and when you want someone to pay attention, presuming they are is not effective. - not any tool I have seen addresses this... (although some funny comedy skits lately about going back to the office and forgetting that you are not working from home).</p>

<p>The main issue with choosing alternative sites and software is always accessibility. Members of some organizations and government branches are very restricted in what software they are allowed to run and sites they're allowed to visit. Zoom was popular enough at the start of the Pandemic to get an exception made for many of these rules. We have experimented internally with other solutions, Discord was brought up after the first Connectathon, but always run into roadblocks.</p>
