<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194993">@Sandra Vance</span> can I get an additional teleconference room for breakout sessions?  I don't want to disrupt work in progress when I need to have a conversation with a smaller group.  (This is for the FHIR Shorthand track.)</p>

<p>I found the breakout room button. It looks like I'm all set.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191447">@Mark Kramer</span>   Glad to hear that Mark.  I think you'll be pleased with the breakout room functionality.  Just know that, from my limited exposure to Zoom breakout rooms,  if someone leaves their breakout room and wants to go to a different breakout room, the host has to let them into that other room...so you'll be the 'bouncer'.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="286087">@Dave Hamill</span>  - can Mark use the "Break Out Room" functionality on GTM for this?</p>

<p>Is there anyway people can move themseleves in/out of breakout rooms w/o having a hall monitor in the main room at all times?<br>
Is there a way to download the attendee list for each track?<br>
Can breakouts record their individual session?</p>

<p>•   Is there anyway people can move themselves in/out of breakout rooms w/o having a hall monitor in the main room at all times?<br>
Unfortunately no. While a participant can leave a breakout room themselves, a Host is needed to allow a participant into a breakout room.</p>
<p>•   Is there a way to download the attendee list for each track?<br>
The Host can access this report (exportable to Excel, etc.) by logging into the account via a browser and selecting ‘Reports’ at the bottom left menu</p>
<p>•   Can breakouts record their individual session?<br>
With my limited exposure to Zoom, I’ve never tested this out.  Per the following Zoom support page, it looks like breakouts can be recorded…<br>

I don't believe so.  In fact,  I don't believe a co-host has that ability; only the single Host on the Zoom meeting.</p>
