<p>Hello!<br>
On a lark, we posted a FHIR meetup after the ONC rule was announced, to see what kind of interest there was in regular meetings in the Chicagoland area, and promptly registered 40 people and got RSVP from a dozen people.<br>
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-FHIR-Meetup/" target="_blank" title="https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-FHIR-Meetup/">https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-FHIR-Meetup/</a></p>
<p>The thought is that we want to try to have quarterly mini-connectathons for the Chicagoland/Midwest area for the next year or two, as local companies get up to speed on 21st Century Cures compliance.</p>
<p>Anything we need to know or do?  And advice?  We're planning on taking attendence, meeting minutes, and trying to run the meetup in the same spirit as the official connectathons and working groups.  <br>
Abby</p>

<p>I'm happy to report that we had a very successful meetup last week of the Chicago FHIR Users Group.  </p>
<p>We had 14 people attend, representing 2 universities and 8 businesses.  There was interest all around in continuing regular meetups and holding quarterly mini-connectathons for the foreseeable future, as well as perhaps coordinating travel to the Working Group(s) and DevDays.  </p>
<p>We held 5 votes total, including an affirmative unanimous vote to apply/register as an HL7 Regional Meetup and Connectathon.  We also have some meeting minutes to register on the Wiki.</p>
