<p>We're currently looking at the feasibility of hosting a connectathon for some of the English NHS FHIR APIs.  We have this pencilled this in for the early part of next year. NHS DIgital have a collection of APIs in development and as such we would look to theme the event based on the different APIs. More formal comms will be going out shortly but if you have queries/questions feel free to get in touch at <a href="mailto:apilabs@nhs.net" title="mailto:apilabs@nhs.net">apilabs@nhs.net</a></p>
