<p>You are invited to join NHS Digital and NHS Wales Informatics Service for a two day connectathon event on Wednesday 2nd October &amp; Thursday 3rd October 2019 at Cardiff City Football Stadium, Leckwith Road, Cardiff, CF11 8AZ</p>
<p>If you are a healthcare organisation or software vendor who needs to manage and implement complex code systems such as SNOMED CT or any of the Health and Social Care Code Systems this may be of particular interest.  </p>
<p>This event is primarily for developers, facilitated by developers. However, the introductory plenary on the first morning is suitable for those in policy and planning, information management, programme management, clinical informaticians and analytical roles.</p>
<p>At this technology-focussed event we aim to: </p>
<p>introduce the NHS Digital and NHS Wales National Terminology Services (NTS) and their use of the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR®) specification.<br>
gather input on further development of the specifications and infrastructure for the NTS. This includes feedback on the planned functionality as well as understanding the priority functionality that implementers and users require.<br>
develop a community of interest to enable participation in the future development of the service.<br>
You are able to attend either day one or both days – full details on how to register, what to expect and preparation guidance are all detailed on the registration page.  Find out more and register your interest in attending here </p>
<p>We reserve the right to limit the number of delegates from each organisation (owing to venue capacity constraints).  We also reserve the right to record the event for future use, to publish attendee lists and use your email for follow up evaluation.</p>
<p>If you have any queries about this event, please email: <a href="mailto:nhsdigital.industryqueries@nhs.net" title="mailto:nhsdigital.industryqueries@nhs.net">nhsdigital.industryqueries@nhs.net</a></p>
