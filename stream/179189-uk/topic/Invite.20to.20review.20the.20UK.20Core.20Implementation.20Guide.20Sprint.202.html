<p>Message from the <a href="https://simplifier.net/guide/UKCoreDevelopmentGuidance/SeniorLeadershipTeam">UK FHIR Delivery Senior Leadership Team</a></p>
<p>You are invited to attend the sprint 2 of the UK FHIR Core Clinical and Technical Assurance process </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are invited to register to participate in Sprint 2 of the clinical and technical assurance process of a set of components for inclusion in the candidate ‘HL7 FHIR UK Core Implementation Guide R4’ in development.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ‘HL7 FHIR UK Core Implementation Guide R4’ is proposed to form a foundation for derivative FHIR Implementation Guides in development in a UK context and is based on the international standard that is common in other countries such as Canada, the US and Australia.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The scope of Sprint 2 is Allergies Intolerance Resource, along with other associated FHIR conformance assets such as Extension, CodeSystems, ValueSets and ConceptMaps.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of the Sprint 2 is to approach the development of all FHIR assets required to support Allergies in FHIR R4 UK Core with a view to support the widest possible usage throughout the UK and to ensure a standard way of handling Allergies so that any interactions between different systems will use the same FHIR structure to greatly improve interoperability and therefore safer outcomes for patients. This will then be part of a Minimum Viable Product release of a candidate ‘HL7 FHIR UK Core Implementation Guide R4’ which would be published via HL7 UK and would ultimately go through an HL7 UK ballot process. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The key value of this Clinical and Technical Assurance process is to have a multi-disciplinary collaboration in an agile team and provide the ability to improve the quality of the product for all. It helps stakeholders, including vendors, to understand the rationale and details behind the design based on use cases. The vendors can raise implementation issues and resolve these issues before the specifications are published. The process promotes consistency in FHIR assets across different programmes and use cases to support interoperability.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The current schedule for the Sprint 2 (all dates in 2021) is as below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposed review pack review <blockquote>
