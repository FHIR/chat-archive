<p>Gp connect spec has a model of medication issues where every issue (medicationrequest - order) has a basedon (parent) plan (another medication request plan). The supplier I'm working with and at least two versions from another supplier (I used to work for) doesn't follow this model (a gp issues a drug, they may plan an issue but normally they dont). <br>
The only way of following the spec is to create synthetic issues with a status of plan (but note I will have real planned issues).</p>
<p>As a consumer I will also need to filter out the synthetic  planned issues (wouldn't want to display/have duplicate/synthetic issues), however I only need to do that if I'm not using MedicationStatement.</p>
<p>I believe the spec is wrong in enforcing this model and interested in views?</p>
