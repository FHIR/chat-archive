<p>Are there any hoops you have to go through in order to setup your service for interperability with the NHS? Our company has been IGSoC registered for a few years - need to look at DSaPT imminently.<br>
Is NHS-related FHIR limited to the N3 / HSCN network? Or can calls be made to/from AWS "Official" secured hosting, for example?</p>
