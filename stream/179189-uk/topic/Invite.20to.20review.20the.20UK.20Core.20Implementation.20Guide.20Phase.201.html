<p>Message from the <a href="https://simplifier.net/guide/UKCoreDevelopmentGuidance/SeniorLeadershipTeam">UK FHIR Delivery Senior Leadership Team</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are invited to review the <a href="https://simplifier.net/guide/clinicalandtechnicalassurancesprint1documentationpack/home">Clinical and Technical Assurance Phase 1 Documentation Pack</a>. The purpose of this documentation pack is to provide a Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) review pack for a set of five UK Core Profiles collectively referred to as fundamental profiles within this documentation for the purpose of Clinical and Technical Assurance(C&amp;TA). The review period of the review pack is 3 weeks from 7th December - 8th January. A consolidated feedback review and disposition call will be held on 22nd January 9:30-11:30 to discuss your feedback. </p>
<p>This pack contains the guidance and reference material required to participate in the Sprint 1 of Clinical and Technical Assurance. The content of the UK Core to be reviewed is contained in the <a href="https://simplifier.net/guide/hl7fhirukcoresprint1snapshot27112020/home">UK Core Snapshot</a></p>
<p>The Sprint 1 of the clinical and technical assurance process is assuring the first set of components for inclusion in the candidate ‘HL7 FHIR UK Core Implementation Guide R4’ in development.</p>
<p>The ‘HL7 FHIR UK Core Implementation Guide R4’ is proposed to form a foundation for derivative FHIR Implementation Guides in development in a UK context and is based on the international standard that is common in other countries such as Canada, the US and Australia.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The scope for Sprint 1 is five resource profiles: Location, Organization, Patient, Practitioner and PractitionerRole along with other associated FHIR conformance assets such as Extension, CodeSystems, ValueSets and ConceptMaps.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Sprint 1 is to the test the clinical and technical assurance process for an initial set of limited FHIR conformance assets, based on use cases identified as needed to support to date, ahead of a Minimum Viable Product candidate release of a candidate ‘HL7 FHIR UK Core Implementation Guide R4’ which is planned would go through an HL7 UK ballot process. Based on the feedback the scope of further sprints will be developed working with the community and will be used to improve the process. Future Clinical and technical assurance will target prioritised use cases from the service, vendors, and NHS arm’s length bodies.</p>
<p>The key value add of the process is the multi-disciplinary collaboration in an agile team and ability to improve quality of the product. It helps stakeholders, including vendors, to understand the rationale and details behind the design based on use cases. The vendors can raise implementation issues and resolve these issues before the specifications are published. The process promotes consistency in FHIR assets across different programmes and use cases to support interoperability.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions, please email us at <a href="mailto:interoperabilityteam@nhs.net">interoperabilityteam@nhs.net</a></p>
