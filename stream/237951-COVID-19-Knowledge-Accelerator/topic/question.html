<p>I was wondering what codes refer to the Vaccination details and testing (especially covid) and is there a directory of other codes for different parts of data?</p>

<p>I don't have  a simple answer to this request.  The COVID-19 Knowledge Accelerator has been focused on FHIR Resource and terminology development for the expression of evidence (scientific knowledge) and statistics, and has focused mainly on therapeutic interventions for COVID-19, so have not directly explored the code systems or value sets for vaccination and testing.</p>
