<p>We have a use-case where a FHIR Consent is generated based on a QuestionnaireResponse  which is in turn based on a PDF form. We want to keep track of both of these sources but <code>Consent.source</code> is <code>0..1</code>. My first impulse was to file a CR to make this an array but I realized that apparently <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/formats.html#choice">an element with choice of data type cannot be an array</a>. I think we should be able to express more than one source for the consent and this might mean we have to allow an array of attachments as well as an array of references to accommodate both. Any thoughts? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192587">@David Pyke</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="199026">@k connor</span></p>

<p>That's been changed in the build</p>
