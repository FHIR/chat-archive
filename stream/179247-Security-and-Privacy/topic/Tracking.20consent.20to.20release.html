<p>I’m sitting in a presentation about management of data about indigenous Australians, and one of the subjects that was raised was effectively implying that there’s a need for tagging information with the consent arrangements under which it was released, so that residual implications of the consent (and who it was from) can be considered. </p>
<p>We don’t really have a framework for this... there’s nowhere for me to put a link to policies applicable to the information and it’s restrictions of use. We do have security labels, which allows for concept labels, but not for tracking specific agreements. Is this something we’re missing, or have I missed something?</p>

<p>If I understand your use case, that's what Consent.policy is for.  Then you would use Consent.source[x] to attach the specific consent to the patient.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  The best approach is to publish the policy and have the policy point at the data that it covers. Having the data point at the policy is a fragle system over time. It seems right at first, but as data ages and as policies change it breaks down. So as long as the access control engine knows it must find the policies that apply to requests for data, then the directionality of the pointer does not matter. Essentially from a high level this is what they are asking for, but technically it is a pointer in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The security tag vocabulary is - mostly - tags that would be used to make factual statements about the data absent any specific policy. However the intent is that becomes bread-crumbs for access control to go find the current policy about that kind of data.</p>

<p>And there are a set of Security tag vocabulary more intended for a communication wrapper (Bundle.meta.security) that identify handling instructions such as do-not-redisclose, do-not-print, must-encrypt, etc. --- these are the odd balls that are security relevant, but used in a very different way. Aka they should not be on data, but should be on communications or used in policy statements (Consent rules).</p>

<p>You can tag the data as falling into a class of data that requires specific policy. This is what the compartment categories are used for, and often a local compartment is defined for a regional privacy regulation (e.g. HIPAA relevant).</p>

<p>So I think we are missing this. Concretely the "permission" or "granting" that says 'this data instance can be processed because of this reason type' e.g. mr doe's data can be shared with insurer because we need to get coverage info, I.e we need this for a contract, and the contract is .../server/contract/contract1. Or instead of contract we have Mr doe's consent, which we recorded over there .../consent/c002</p>

<p>Catching up with thread, I think this demonstrates the need for a more general mechanism for tagging a resource with the custom policies that must govern its use by the recipient. This is very similar to the case of digital rights management where a resource is published together with a <em>license</em> that describes all the rules that must be applied to its use. <br>
General security labels can support this when the applicable rules are general (e.g. do not redisclose or delete after use), but when rules are specific, we need a mechanism to actually articulate the applicable rules rather than referencing them in the form of a value from a standard vocabulary. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  I wonder if this can be covered by labeling with <br>

<p>Note that there is discussions of extracting out the permission rules language out of Consent so that one can have a set of rules that one could publish independent of Consent. This concept would be leveraged by Consent, but useful as a set of permission rules for many other use-cases.</p>

<p>The Security Labels include Privacy Tags for Policy and Consent Types - no need to use Compartment, which is more about a specialization of a POU by a particular project - e.g., a specific Care Team or Research Projects.  There are already generic and specific privacy policies and consent directives in v.3 under ActPolicy @ <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/v3/ActCode/cs.html" target="_blank" title="https://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/v3/ActCode/cs.html">https://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/v3/ActCode/cs.html</a> - there's no URL to this part of the code system so search on ActPolicy.  Using this Privacy Tag one can differentiate why information is deemed to have a certain level of Confidentiality protection for a particular Sensitivity type and this combination drives the security control/handling caveats for POU, obligations, and refrain codes.  One issue that this thread points out, and was discussed on today's FHIR Consent call is that  we may need both an URL and a version number because those can change while the policy/consent agreed to may have been made against a precedent and may be effective for those terms for a period of time that extends beyond the introduction of a new version/URL.</p>

<p>RE previous discussion on adding an extension to the Obligation label Comply with consent directive and an extension that provides the link to the specific consent resource that must be followed.  How would an extension for an instance of a  consent directive be constructed?  E.g., <br>
  &lt;security&gt;<br>
            &lt;system value="http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode"/&gt;<br>
            &lt;code value="42CFRPart2"/&gt;<br>
            &lt;display value="42 CFR Part 2"/&gt;<br>
        &lt;/security&gt;<br>
Or an extension on a Compartment label that identifies a specific Care Team?<br>
Also, any ideas on an extension to point to the entity that assigned the label?  For example, a CUI PrivacyMark that is displayed to end users as required under 32 CFR 2002, must also include the name and contact information of the designating Federal agency.   Seems like there should be a common approach for these use cases.</p>

<p>These policies would live in the Consent Resource. (Unless they were broader organizational policy not specific to the patient or transaction). Don't put transactional or patient specific policy into the data. Those are attributes about the transaction or about the patient; they are not attributes about the data. The meta.security should be only meta about the data.<br>
Where a policy is about specific data, the Consent.provision would have rules about that specific data. That is the Observation in question would explicitly be listed in a Consent.provision.data.reference with a .data.meaning of instant; and the .securityLabel holding the security obligation.</p>

<p>this argument that the data must have a pointer to the policy is counter to both policy modeling, and to REST itself (we might as well change all of FHIR so that the References are bi-directional, Patient should have a data element that points at every piece of data where the patient is the subject, thus changing Patient every time new data is created) -- this is not the REST model, where one directional pointers are used and the pointer lives in the resource that was created last (usually). There is also plenty of experience in Access Control domain and expressed in Access Control standards that show that policy should point at the data it controls. Attribute-Based-Access-Controls is fundamentally based around this concept. The meta element is meta about the data, independent of policy, yet informing policy about meta attributes about the data.</p>

<p>Maybe restating would clarify my question:<br>
I was asking whether the Part 2 policy code in a security label could reference the actual  instance of a Part 2 consent directive URL .<br>
This isn't about having the data point to a consent and having to be updated for every consent (Patient Resource example from John.)  It's just specifying the instance of a policy code in the security label.<br>
RE Compartment - there are several "team" type codes already in v3.  But if I want to limit to access to a team, which may be designated by a consent directive - again, Part 2, it would be helpful to have an extension that could be used as an identifier/URL list of the actual care team members.   When the team members want to access/share the care plan, then they could declare the Care Team compartment code and an identifier.  <br>
CUI use case is the need to always display the name and contact of the original classifier (designating federal agency) - see page 13 of <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/20161206-cui-marking-handbook-v1-1.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/20161206-cui-marking-handbook-v1-1.pdf">https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/20161206-cui-marking-handbook-v1-1.pdf</a>.  </p>
<p>Having an extension of the PrivacyMark security labels would work for CUI because they are rendered.   </p>
<p>But not all security labels are rendered so perhaps I also need to create a new Obligation Code (e.g. Record Classifier, Reclassifer, Declassifier) for the "Share with Protections" use case, and have an extension for the actual contact name/contact.</p>

<p>The rules around CUI that compell some message be displayed is something that would be in business logic.

<p>Having the policy point to the data doesn't help if you receive the data and have no clue where to look for the policy(ies).

<p>So in your scenario you seem to have access to the repository holding the policy... thus you can just look there to see if there is a policy. If you receive data, and wonder if the policy is remote, you can always check at that time and have an implementation specific policy pointer cache. This efficiency design cache is an implementation detail, not something we break the specification for.<br>
If you don't have access to this policy repository, then it is important that when I send you data, that I also send you the policy.<br>
This sending of the policy may use the current Consent, or might be good use-case for the new Permission resource. (need good use-cases to drive this new design).   Even the remote access of a policy repository might be good use-case for the Permission resource. But the Permissions would still point at the data, not the data pointing at the policy.</p>

<p>Having access and knowing where it is are very different things.  There could be thousands of policy servers all over the place (and some of them might move).  The fact I have access to data doesn't necessarily mean I know what servers are relevant.

<p>I guess the question is whether you presume that a formal legal agreement will exist with all entities where data is disclosed to and that all such entities will also have the technical mechanism to locate all relevant servers.  (And/or that if no formal legal agreement exists that asserted policies become irrelevant.)  I, personally, think we're trying to move to a place where pre-negotiated agreements are the exception rather than the rule and so long as the players are in a 'community' that the systems involved can come and go without advance notice.)</p>

<p>I agree with Lloyd's assessment that we're evolving to an exchange ecosystem in which static agreements are no longer scalable. Mohammad and I have been talking about this idea: Could a Server's CapabilityStatement include the policies it requires of clients, which a client could discover and compare to its own CapabilityStatement capabilities for enforcing?  If it can, then it requests interactions with the Server.  The Server can examine the client's CapabilityStatement as one of the factors in deciding whether to agree.  This could even be legally binding.  </p>
<p>E.g., the Server says it only interacts with Clients who are certified to meet some discoverable Trust Framework - e.g., CARIN Alliance Code of Conduct <a href="https://www.carinalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019_CARIN_Code_of_Conduct_05082019.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://www.carinalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019_CARIN_Code_of_Conduct_05082019.pdf">https://www.carinalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019_CARIN_Code_of_Conduct_05082019.pdf</a>.  The client asserts their credentials, which the Server could potentially validate.  If the client is non-compliant, at a minimum, the certification would be revoked.</p>
<p>There could also be dynamic negotiations, e.g., if a client can't enforce some aspects of a policy but is able to enforce a subset, then the Server would restrict disclosures to information for which the client could compliantly protect?  This is perhaps a FHIR approach to implementing what is described in the HL7 Trust Framework for Federated Authorization conceptual model that Security balloted.</p>

<p>Where it gets really close is with DRM, where the object sent is wrapped in a DRM package which encrypts the content with a header that indicates where the policy engine is. Upon use of a DRM package the policy engine is challanged with various context and user tokens, and possibly a key is exposed to unlock the DRM package. This might be the system you invision, if it is.. then fine.. that solution is available off-the-shelf, and does NOT need us to add pointers at the header of each Resource pointing at the policy.</p>

<p>As to Kathleen's question around security negotiation by using the CapabilityStatement, yes, this is built in today. It needs a set of security Implementation Guides defined. There are a set already available, but more are always useful. Note that the CapabilityStatement takes care of one level of this negotiation where the security protocols themselves take care of other level negotiations (TLS, Open-ID-Connect, App Reg, etc). Where a security layer has negotiations, we should leverage it, and not try to duplicate it.</p>

<p>The point I keep trying to make is that data should not have an instance pointer to the policy, that the policy would point at the data. This is a principle that has been learned the hard way in Access Control standards. This is a principle that I learned the hard way in IHE when I originally wrote BPPC to work that way. I am not saying that it should be obvious why this principle must be followed, I failed to follow it myself multiple times. It doesn't fail hard until time and reality come in and make your policies dynamic. Once that happens all of your data must be UPDATED, for only the reason of access control policy reason, while those modifications (with provenance) will not be easy (because data gets copied and moves) and many agents using the data will see the data was updated and not understand it was only for access control policy reasons.</p>

<p>Where a Research project receives data, it is common for a research database to create local policies that identify from where did this data come from and what restrictions are on it. They need this Provenance for their records-keeping, and the policy for any further secondary use. This provenance/policy is is often self generated based on business policies informed by the trust-relationship, but could be augmented by policy that might be in the data transfer package (embedded Consent, or 'Permission').
