<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="199026">@k connor</span>  and I discussed this on the FHIR Security call. Would like others comments and endorsements.</p>
<p>Add an extension on the Coding datatype, for use when the code is a CUI*** code, so that the author of that CUI tag can be identified and so that the manditory banner can be included.</p>
<p>this annotation extension is only to be used in .meta.security, and only when the system is v3-ActCode and the code is one of the CUI codes.</p>

<p>The problem the extension is addressing is that there are regulated requirements on what must be displayed on the screen when the data have CUI class of tags.  The thing that is displayed is a combination of codes, not just the list of codes.. I am not clear.. see the link Kathleen adds.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don't understand. what's the 'author'? THe organization that defined the policy? That should be part of the definition of the CUI code? Why is any of this needed to display a banner?</p>

<p>take a look at the example I gave above. It started with the example on the security-labels page, and adds the three CUI codes that will typically be added (they are always added in tripplets as far as I can tell). They then have the annotation explaining that this data must have the text "CUI//SP-HLTH/HLTH/PRVCY" displayed on the screen</p>

<p>It seems to me that what we are missing is a mechanism (either as an extension to the narrative section, or as a security label) to specify a marking that SHALL be displayed in any rendering of the resource to a human user (e.g. on screen, printout, etc.). If we have this mechanism, then an IG can define the rules for computing the mandatory marking from the CUI codes, either by the sender or the recipient.</p>

<p>where do you want to specify it? We have a way to do this in an implementation guide, to mark an element and particular codes as 'must-support' and to say what this means, such that if you claim to conform to the IG, you are bound to do what it says</p>

<p>One thing I'm a bit concerned about is the notion of calling it out in <em>all</em> US implementation guides.  I don't think it's appropriate to replicate the same language across all of the various Da Vinci, CARIN and other IGs.  It would be better to stick the expectations in one place and then those IGs where the requirement is relevant can just 'point'.  It also means that if the guidance or recommendations evolve, there's only one place we'd need to make the change rather than worrying about trying to update everything.</p>

<p>In John's example at the top of this thread, you'll see 3 security labels that contain CUI codes that are already adopted by HL7.  The Annotation extension is intended to indicate how the 3 codes are to be concatenated for display to end users via the narrative along with the Designator's Federal Agency name and contact information.  The Designator is the CUI classifier.  So we have the mechanisms to meet 32 CFR Part 2002 requirements.  I agree that this guidance should be documented in one place, e.g., the Security Label Module, so that any IG can reference it.  I will create a CR for this.</p>

<p>I like this idea. So it would not be on each .meta.security code. but rather would be one narrative extension at the resource level? This would seem to be more easy to process and more easy to create and manage</p>

<p>I guess we would define an extension that has a mandatory banner, with a type markdown, with the idea that this is some explicit narrative that systems are required by applicable regulation to display one way or another when they display the resource</p>

<p>@Grahame Grieve - Please let us know how to fix the example if Annotation is the correct extension to use or suggest a different extension.  My understanding is that the Annotation  text is where the correct concatenation of the 3 CUI labels goes.  CUI IG would  required implementers to display the Annotation text  at the top of the narrative and in the following line, display the name and contact information from the authorReference Organization. If there's a better way to meet the rendering requirements, please advise.</p>

<p>well, I don't understand what is being proposed and it doesn't seem to correlate with the discussion. 3 CUI codes, each with the same extension... are you being asked to do the same thing 3 times? </p>
<p>What does the combination CUI//SP-HLTH/HLTH/PRVCY mean anyway? </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CUIHLTHP: "A displayed mark, required to be rendered as "(CUI//HLTH)", indicating that a portion of an electronic or hardcopy information is protected at the level of the subset of CUI for which the authorizing law, regulation, or Government-wide policy does not set out specific handling or dissemination controls. "</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CUIPRVCY: "A displayed mark, required to be rendered as "CUI//PRVCY", indicating that the electronic or hardcopy controlled unclassified basic privacy information is private and must be protected at the level of the subset of CUI for which the authorizing law, regulation, or Government-wide policy does not set out specific handling or dissemination controls"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CUISP-HLTH: "A displayed mark, required to be rendered as "CUI//SP-HLTH", indicating that the electronic or hardcopy information is protected at the level of the subset of CUI in which the authorizing law, regulation, or Government-wide policy contains specific handling controls that it requires or permits agencies to use that differ from those for CUI Basic"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of those makes no sense to me - they're all saying the same thing. Which is a null statement. This resource contains information which is controlled as set out by some regulation.... or not... what?</p>

<p>This is why I liked Mohamed's recommendation that there need be only one extension at the .meta level for a security-header. <br>
I fail to see why that is not covering the need. I do not see how the requirement is that the narrative must be so directly embeded in the exact location where the codes are, and that the narrative be repeated three times</p>

<p>Thanks for the example. Problem is that all of the required CUI codes must be concatenated into one for the banner. So how do we avoid putting the same extension-must-display after each of the security labels with CUI codes, i.e., CUISP-HLTH, CUIHLTH, CUIPRVCY so that the "must display" text = CUI//SP-HLTH/HLTH/PRVCY?</p>

<p>Thanks for the example. Problem is that all of the required CUI codes must be concatenated into one for the banner. So how do we avoid putting the same extension-must-display after each of the security labels with CUI codes, i.e., CUISP-HLTH, CUIHLTH, CUIPRVCY so that the "must display" text = CUI//SP-HLTH/HLTH/PRVCY?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why does it need to repeat on each code? It is one thing that must be displayed...</p>

<p>I'm fine if it works to put the extension on one of the CUI labels as long as the display requirement is to concatenate all of the CUI labels in the prescribed format.  Just wasn't sure how this works.  Seems like the rules are set in an IG and then programmed to do what's prescribed.  I'm happy if you all think this works.  Just in time, because Sequoia will be meeting on this again on Thursday, so should I update the information with this new extension???  Do I need to put into a CR?</p>

<p>RE Grahame's noting the seemingly duplicative definitions at <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/SEC/HL7+CUI+Codes+for+Security+Labels-" target="_blank" title="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/SEC/HL7+CUI+Codes+for+Security+Labels-">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/SEC/HL7+CUI+Codes+for+Security+Labels-</a> one has to check the link to the multiple "authorities" categorized by these codes. A bunch of lawyers went through the statutes and regs and pulled out ones that seem to be in a particular domain (e.g., Health vs Privacy, but those are overlapping), and then differentiated those that seemed to have different security requirements than specified by NIST SP 800-171 - and made those laws/authorities "specified". So check the examples for the codes for idea on why they are different. <br>
I'm the last to argue that any of this makes sense. It would likely have been much more efficient to just tell everyone to comply with 800-171 except where there's a more stringent security safeguard. Guessing this was the only way to downstream these security controls to the private sector. Oh well. </p>
<p>Anyway, had some questions about Grahame's example so I can write a proper CR. <br>
We think we need to have all 3 CUI labels in the text, and that each of the CUI should be listed as a label so that access control systems can key off of the codes to determine which security controls to apply to the contents.</p>

<p>This is very much a U.S.-specific notion.  I've never heard of this happening elsewhere.  (To be honest, I haven't heard of it happening for real in the U.S. either).

<p>This IG might be a rather small one... requiring compliance with NIST 800-171, requiring all data are labeled with three CUI codes (providing a ValueSet with these codes, and a combination rule),  requiring all data have this annotation attached, and requiring all display of data display the annotation found in the data. That could be a nice compact security IG to add to the library of security/privacy IG.</p>

<p>I'm fine with a US Core CUI IG, but think that are other use cases for the extension - e.g., take COPYMark or ConfidentialMark.  There's nothing US specific about a business need to have certain security labels generally or PrivacyMark specific security label, defined as being used for rendering.  So I propose that the extension-must-display be added to FHIR Core and that a US Core CUI IG, which would include a profile on that extension specific to the CUI use case be developed.</p>

<p>The CUI security labels tell the access control system about which of the CUI policies apply - e.g., SP-HLTH (specified health) says enforce HIPAA Security Safeguards in the statute, which governs IIHI in addition to the subsect ePHI governed under the HIPAA Security Rule, which is considered basic health (HLTH), for which access control must enforce  NIST SP 800-171. PRVCY is also NIST SP-800-171 for purposes of protecting against breach of PII.  So there's more going on here than requiring a display.  There's a machine readable aspect which is the same for the other security label tags - Confidentiality codes limit access to those authorized for that level of confidential information, ditto purpose of use restricts the uses per policy.</p>

<p>RE is the list of medications sufficient to require the banner?  Yes, I'm fairly sure that there won't be "portion marking" - i.e., everything will be treated as CUI if anything is CUI.  Portion marking would be very burdensome with little value.  The difference between the security controls required by HIPAA Security Safeguards in the statute [which covers a broader set of information - i.e., IIHI, and not just ePHI] and those required by NIST SP 800-171 is a set of 26 controls, which are not heavy lifts - although in combination, they will take effort.  But that's nothing compared to trying to segregate CUI from non-CUI.  And that's likely not unintended - raising all security boats via CUI.  Eventually every provider/payer/BA will have CUI in their system, so think they'll all eventually comply with 800-171 in addition to whatever other security requirements pertain from other policies.</p>

<p>Seems the codes we have are the right thing to do on each Resource. However it seems to me that these banner and many of the marking functions would be much better handled with Provenance. It might be a specific kind of Provenance so that it can be readily found (and included in a Bundle). Much of these banner requirements seem far more Provenance based. Including who put the tags on, why (policy), etc.</p>

<p>Initial review suggested that 3 codes are needed for each of the authorities that apply.  That still hasn't been fully vetted.  However, NARA agreed that at least SP-HLTH is required. RE Provenance inside of Bundle - not sure that makes sense since Bundle doesn't support narrative.  But can't really include Provenance in a Composition or a Resource as far as I know.  As for algorithm to determine how to concatenate - that might be useful if we were solving the issue for other industries, but NIEM has that job.  Hope is to land on a single default CUI marking for exchanged health information, so having an algorithm that only yields the same display seems like overkill. <br>
RE GG "why in the Resource itself?" If a Resource is displayed on its own, it's a CUI document per <a href="https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/cui-glossary.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/cui-glossary.html">https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/cui-glossary.html</a> so it needs it's own banner.

<p>Another thought about why this is not provenance (over and above the case that provenance resource doesn't seem to work for the use case as stated above) - the purpose of CUI markings is to control access and to give obligations to the recipient, and to tell them who told them so - not to give the history of who told them so - specifically so that the recipient can go back to the classifier (Designator's Agency) and ask to reclassify or to let them know that they classified it incorrectly.  Access control is not something that provenance should be used for - unless we want to greatly expand the scope of this resource.  It's prospective instructions, not historical metadata.</p>

<p>Note, I am not moving the tagging into Provenance. That is clearly data tagging. What I am suggesting is Provenance is the banner and the requirements to indicate who applied the tags and why they assigned the tags.  I see no reason why a Provenance can't be included in a document, where do you see that as a limit? However, documents already have mechanics for banner so in a document I would leverage THAT mechanics (might use both if one really wants to).</p>

<p>I think the argument here is that FHIR specs seem to have already accepted that certain provenance information (e.g. author or some things in <code>meta</code>) be encoded inline with the resource, for reasons such as simpler and more efficient traceability and/or to minimizing the risk of separating the resource from the metadata. So, considering we already store <em>some</em> provenance information within the resource, I think the question is whether those arguments apply here to the case of CUI labeling authority. I think if the CUI guidelines consider the labeling authority a mandatory field which must be displayed as part of the CUI banner, then that is an argument in favor of not separating the labeling authority from the label.</p>

<p>RE inline provenance, <br>
I thought of this as a potential remedy instead of defining all kinds of new extensions. Will it be helpful if we allow <code>meta</code> to encode a Provenance resource for the cases where it's crucial that (certain types of) provenance information remain tied to, and inseparable from, the resource?</p>

<p>anything is possible. There is a proposal above that is an extension on .meta, and it is still part of the discussion. Having Provenance as a Resource has merit. Pulling that inline can be done with "Contained", but then the benefits of being a Resource are lost.  My point of preference for Provenance vs extension on .meta is because everything I hear about the authority and banner requirements simply are Provenance. I don't think we should have a totally different provenance mechanism for CUI provenance, than we expect for all other kinds of provenance.</p>

<p>I am expecting that we would have a CUI Implementation Guide that has specific requirements on data publishers and data consumers. That IG can demand the consumer to do all the required mechanics regardless of the FHIR encoding we use. Thus we should not look to overload the encoding with mechanics, the encoding should be logical and efficient. So the mandate to display the banner has more to do with the IG, any of the proposed FHIR encodings would likely work.</p>

<p>so, hearing that possibly the banner requirement might be satisfied by simply making sure all participants agreeing to CUI (an IG conformance) will assure that all .text elements have the banner text encoded within, and all who display will display the banner text (and make the .text element available )</p>

<p>so we might be down to just needing a simple extension for the authority that applied that code. This might be a useful thing for other purposes too?  is this just a .meta.security need? Or is this more general to CodeableConcept everywhere?</p>

<p>yuck. that is over-engineered and I predict that if that is the solution then the whole CUI system will totally fail (like the government mandate for us to retire TCP/IP and use TP4/CLNP). Regulations that are unrealistic are ignored and go away.</p>

<p>Why 3 codes.  Review of applicable CUI authorities suggests that there are 3 types of CUI Categories involved in general US health information exchange: HIPAA Statute Security safeguards (SP-HLTH), prevalent health privacy laws - e.g.,42 CFR  Part 2 (SAMSHA SUD), Title 38 Section 7332 (VA Confidentiality), and HIPAA Security/Privacy Regulations (not the statute, which covers IIHI of which ePHI/PHI are a subset), and the Privacy requirements under OMB -17-12, and this intersection of authorities is explained at <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/SEC/Controlled+Unclassified+Information+%28CUI%29+Problem+and+Solutions" target="_blank" title="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/SEC/Controlled+Unclassified+Information+%28CUI%29+Problem+and+Solutions">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/SEC/Controlled+Unclassified+Information+%28CUI%29+Problem+and+Solutions</a>.  But I didn't create the concatenation from hell code set when I put in the CUI codes. I made one for each CUI type in the CUI marking handbook since each has their own conceptual space.  So if more than one CUI code applies, they need to be concatenated in the display required to be rendered to end users.  Hope this helps. Maybe we won't need 3 codes in the end.  Maybe we'll only need SP-HLTH, which NARA has already confirmed we'll need.  Then this issue may evaporate at least for this CUI use case.</p>
