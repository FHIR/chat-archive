<p>I have noticed that in FHIR we have not made clear a rule that we have had in IHE for 15 years. That rule is that when recording any security / privacy relevant event, WHEN YOU KNOW the patient identity, include the patient identity as another .entity. This rule has "when you know" because there are plenty of times that you don't know. But when doing operations on patient relevant resources in FHIR the patient id is right there in the patient relevant resource (e.g. Observation.subject), or clear on query where a ?patient parameter is used...   Thus the existance of an .entiity of the Patient becomes a required-if-known.  If we did that, then the AuditEvents would show up in the patient compartment, and be more easy to find.<br>
Seems we should have a profile in the core specification on AuditEvent to define this... right?</p>

<p>Patient as a user -- note that accesses by the patient would all be audited with the patient's user identity in the auditEvent.agent; so these are all fully covered and the situation context is understood.   It is possible that their delegated agent might also be understood...</p>

<p>Query/Search/Operations -- these are not fully covered in a simple "reasonable effort" rule, so might need special handling that is not today recommended in IHE (often). In IHE a query/search or operation are just logged as an Execute with the parameters encoded. with an exception where the query specifically identifies the patient. So the cases that are not covered are those search/query/operations where there is not a patient identified in the request. This is seen as a gap caused by it being too hard to properly handle the result. This gap is not a problem when the audit analysis is occasional deep inspection (user is suspected of bad behavior, patient complains of bad behavior, malpractice suit needs evidence, law asks for specific evidence); these cases can re-create the results. The problem is that this solution does not work well for Patient Access/Accounting of Disclosures function.  The solution is to tell the server audit logging agent to wait until the response is known, then iterate through the response for all indications of patient(s). In these cases one needs to log as many auditEvent records as there were patients exposed in that one search/query/operation. This is done in a few cases in IHE that were seen as specifically Privacy problems, and we could leave this to specific FHIR IG too.  The need to make many audit events is because of the privacy use-case.</p>

<p>Im just wondering how to drive everyone to include the patient when they can... vs today where it is not said, and thus I have found audit logs with no patient.. and because there is no patient, then the patient user can't see those audit logs.. so looking for a mechanism to drive better logging. So I think the profile would simply be a generic AuditEvent that has a .entity that is a Patient with the entity.role of "1" - Patient</p>

<p>the easy solution is to add a section to the AuditEvent narrative (like 6.4.4.7 - Identify Patient whenever possible). Add the above explanation and exceptions. -- hopefully others help with that text.</p>

<p>Note that this proposal to add patient entity to auditEvent records is independent of the decision to make auditEvent records available to the Patient. I think they should be available to the Patient, but THIS thread is more about getting useful AuditEvent records. The addition of a Patient entity, where ever possible, enhances all use-cases for AuditEvent and not just Patient access.</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not logging the fact that a patient result was included in a search unless the resource was actually returned to the client (e.g. based on paging)</li>
<li>it's a big hit on my search performance since I now actually have to process the object (can't send out pre-prepared byte streams without parsing)  (that's an implementation issue specific to me)</li>
<li>I'm not logging transactions and batches; I already log the individual operations in them, so patients won't see the transaction/batch </li>
<li>I am logging hits on the history too, but I think that must patients won't see that</li>

<p>in the case of Delete, wouldn't you capture the Patient being affected prior to the delete? Yes you would still need to wait to log until you knew success/failure... Given this is obvious, I am wondering what I a am missing. Or is this just code workflow that gets in your way?</p>

<p>correct. The results of query/search/operation are not logged. just the parameters of the request; but this new guidance does ask that an audit event is recorded with an .entity of the patient affected.</p>

<p>yes, that's what I do. But if then, later, someone syncs using a history request and is informed that this resource has been deleted, I can no longer link that to the patient since I no longer know what the resource said</p>

<p>well, that doesn't look like it is exposing data, so that reason for logging is not present. It is however that someone is 'trying' to get at the data, which is interesting to privacy or security office. I suspect simply logging the request is sufficient. Makes me wonder how you would indicate it was a request for something that has been deleted. Not exactly success, nor failure. I guess you could use "Minor Failure", although the description for that is that it is like 4xx responses. Is there OperationOutcome encoding?</p>

<p>this is <em>not</em> unusual. This is an inevitable consequence of the history operation - you might listen to a resource type. It's a request that says 'let me know of all changes to Observation since X' where X is the time from the header last time I made the request. You get all added / updated resources, and a note about any deleted resources so you know to delete them too. But all you get is the id of the deleted resource, so you can find it and delete it. </p>
<p>In this case, the patient audit trail will note that the resource was sent in a history when the history picks up it's creation/update, but won't when the history picks up the fact that it was deleted</p>

<p>correct. a AuditEvent for a Query event just records the query that it responded to, with success vs failure. The presumption is that the results are deterministic, and could be re-created historically if needed. That the query parameters are far more important.  </p>
<p>There are some proposals to include some request id that is internally useful, or possibly a response id. </p>
<p>Given REST, I could see an advanced version that enumerates just the id values of the resources returned. </p>
<p>But certainly shall NOT replicate in the audit log the resources that were returned. Otherwise your audit log becomes a huge replication upon replication of your database. And further the audit log would then become very sensitive.</p>
<p>I should explain this.. Ill add a TODO to explain this.</p>

<li>The server is quite likely not going to have a resource that describes the client. At a minimum, I will have an IP address. I may have an openID connect url if I used OAuth to identify the client - but no, you split that out to a different agent, so all I'll have for the client is an IP address, and possibly a secret that implies a software id </li>
<li>the human - again, I may have an openIDConnect id, I may have a name, I may have an email address</li>

<ul>
<li>I only profiled success. I stated this in the sushi, but forgot to bring that forward in narrative. Errors would be reported as normal errors would be reported, I can add them. Is there specific errors ? I don't want to profile all possible errors.</li>
<li>The server is the source, when the server is the one detecting and reporting the audit event. But the client can also record an audit event, and I would encourage the clients to also record the audit events. The reason is that it creates a pattern that  can be watched and deviations flagged for followup. Such as when the client stops recording an audit log, is likely a case where the client credentials have been stolen. You would notice this far sooner when both parties are recording. </li>
<li>The Device resource just seems the closest thing , from the possible agents, that we have to a resource for identifying an app or a server. I imagine it is just described in terms of the identifier. Thus the degenerate form is to use who.identifier. I didn't go into all of these as they are generic auditEvent use, not specific to REST operations when a Patient is a subject.</li>
<li>network can be the domain name, it does not need to be IP.</li>
<li>I am fixing the patient to 1..1 because I am only profiling REST operations that involve a patient as the subject.</li>

<p>In theory the difference between a client recording and a server recording the same fact is simply that the .source is different. All the other information would be profiled the same for both..   In fact something I should have included is that these AuditEvents could also be recorded by the OAuth authorization service. Thus in FHIR one might have three AuditEvents for the same event, although given OAuth token re-use this is likely to not be one-for-one, but would be visible over a session. I should add this?</p>

<p>Client v Server logging is likely to be different in practice. When success happens, they are closest, but the client might know more about the reason the transaction was requested, like the context within an episode of care or care plan. Information that is not needed in the FHIR REST interaction. This could be put into the one AuditEvent from the client.   When failures happen, the client is at a disadvantage, the server is more likely to be able to elaborate on the detail.</p>

<p>IHE has historically defined both client and server audit messages. But these are in the context of the audit requirements given some other transaction (e.g. XDS Query). Thus the goal is to profile the AuditEvent more tightly to the expectations of that other transaction context. I think this kind of specialization will happen.</p>
