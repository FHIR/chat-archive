<p>Hi folks - I know nothing about security issues except in the most generic terms, but:</p>
<p>I just ran into this February report, which, if valid, seems pretty appalling. <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/cybersecurity/30-popular-mobile-health-apps-vulnerable-to-cyberattacks-phi-exposure.html">https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/cybersecurity/30-popular-mobile-health-apps-vulnerable-to-cyberattacks-phi-exposure.html</a></p>
<p>Holy crap, hard-coding security keys?? And things like that. And a vulnerability where a hacker can just replay a FaceID session to reactivate the authentication and play around? Etc etc.</p>
<p>Or am I falling prey to a bogus press release? I know the project was funded by Approov, who makes a product that claims to remove the vulnerabilities; that's a separate question from: are these vulnerabilities truly there?</p>

<p>I am not surprised at all. In fact most SMART-on-FHIR apps likely have their client_id password hard coded.   Security is hard, idiots are powerful.</p>

<p>I agree with John - I feel like this is pretty much expected and normal in software.  And is not a healthcare specific problem.  As long as there are mortal humans building things, the outcomes reported in that article will remain true.  Giving more parties access to patient data was always a decision that involved pros and cons.  I think we both agree that the pros far outweigh the cons, but you've discovered one of the cons:  the more parties that have patient data, the more opportunities there are for that data to be stolen and misused by bad actors.</p>

<p>To be clear, the problem here isn't the patient being "trusted with their data."  It's basic security standards for FHIR API's.   I'm currently on ONC Steering Committee for FHIR Factories and working to get this research in the hands of the right stakeholders at ONC.  FHIR vulnerabilities are fixable problems, and pretty basic when developing secure API's.  For example BOLA is a very common and fixable vulnerability found in 100% of the FHIR API's tested in this attached report.  I wouldn't expect patients to know the first thing about this.  Rather, I'd expect Health IT professional to know how to secure their FHIR  API's.  This is all new and we'll get there ( :  <a href="/user_uploads/10155/gdvRUKw9vvCc5scYkxGK2NRI/FHIR-hacking-mhealth-apps-with-apis.pdf">FHIR-hacking-mhealth-apps-with-apis.pdf</a></p>

<p>That's perfectly fine - if your authorized to look at multiple patients and multiple types of records - which may well be the case for the providers, and with constraints, even for patients (e.g. a patient might be authorized to access records of a minor child, etc.)  However, the system should absolutely not honor a query you don't have the right to execute.  It should assume everyone knows how to formulate a valid query.</p>

<p>For BOLA, that sounds like it's talking about servers, not clients? I think the ecosystem of servers is a different problem than the ecosystem of client apps. Servers are not something chosen by the patient, so there should be more accountability.</p>
<p>Regardless, the statement "Out of the API endpoints tested, 100% were vulnerable" is difficult to believe. It would indicate that no one enforces access control successfully.</p>

<p>I'm not seeing what the issue issue is in the inset image above; a client is authorized with certain scopes of access up-front; the client can then issue many potentially different queries (e.g., with different query parameters), and it's the server's job to ensure the client only sees data it was authorized to see. Asking about different LOINC codes in different queries is generally fine, when this is consistent with the authorized scope of access.</p>

<p>To be clear, I'm not talking about queries where access is authorized.  Alissa was able to look at entire record sets of patients admitted to a hospital.  Here is one example of many.   I'd be happy to connect anyone w/ her or set up a call if there are questions. My takeaway:  there's some pretty basic things that can be done to harden the security of FHIR API's and standards are lacking.   <a href="/user_uploads/10155/seHsepQz0Ej3mNr_18L0if9O/Screen-Shot-2021-05-25-at-1.41.13-PM.png">Screen-Shot-2021-05-25-at-1.41.13-PM.png</a></p>

<p>Ok, I read through the report more carefully and the vulnerable APIs aren't the EHRs (which is what gave me pause about "100% vulnerable", I'm pretty sure some of the EHRs have successfully implemented access control) - it's the server backends of the mHealth apps.</p>

<p>I just looked at the screenshot stating "BOLA vulnerability found allowing me to see all patients admitted into the hospital". I know I should be reading the article but haven't gotten around to it yet; if it wasn't an EHR vulnerability, what system <em>was</em> storing/leaking these data?</p>

<p>I'm not seeing, from the document, where there were documented access problems in real clinical systems using Smart on FHIR here. BOLA would imply some predictability around the random numbers in the access tokens. I haven't worked with any implementation that wasn't using UUIDs for those (I haven't worked that many real ones...)</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> to be clear some of the vulnerabilities found do directly impact the hospital.   Not all is published in this report and will be disclosed in June.  How about:  let's take conversation to DM and coordinate a call w/ Alissa.   My goal is to figure out who the coordinating body for this would be (ONC?) so there are some basic security standards / patches before the July deadline.  Thx!</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="379458">Andrea Downing</span>! I'd be very happy to meet with Alissa -- from the description above, this sounds like a critical vulnerability. I know how challenging these can be to report and track (e.g., <a href="https://smarthealthit.org/2014/04/case-study-security-vulnerabilities-in-ccda/smarthealthit.org/2014/04/ehr-security-vulnerability-reporting/">this blog post documents my experience</a> reporting across multiple vendors in 2014)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> While there may be a larger discussion going on on the vulnerabilities. I want to take this opportunity to seek guidance on what does FHIR or SMART say about securing documents/imageURLs like you stated in your post <code>&lt;img src="http://hack.me/leaked-from-image.png"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;</code>. The custom scopes are at resource level, and the resource endpoints are protected by them. But there can be a case where even a server can leak these URIs/URLs, leaving them vulnerable and hard to track the origination of leak. Since these are free form URLs they don't follow a resource model. How can they be protected in a shared model like FHIR ?</p>

<p>It's important to consider specific threats here. Are you worried about clinical data leaking inadvertently from a document to a third party? Intentional tracking by the documents author ("phone home")? EHR session compromise when a maliciously authored document is displayed?</p>

<p>In the general case, clinical documents are part of a record and can be shared. Documents can include links. That's not inherently a problem. If dereferencing a link would <em>unintentionally leak</em> information, then document authors should avoid creating links like that. But in general, document receivers should also be cautious about when/where to dereference a link. For an analogy: in GMail, I have "do not show images" enabled by default, which prevents a lot of tracking; email authors know this is a common setting, so they directly embed most visually important images to ensure they can work locally.</p>

<p>In the case of releasing data that has embedded URLs certainly does not remove the responsibility for the client to be careful getting the content at that URL, or proper security of that URL. It is not uncommon for Access Control being needed to access those URLs. The case of a style-sheet or images supporting a style-sheet; is likely a case where the GET will not encounter any access control. although the links should still be https, and be confirmed as coming from a trusted server.</p>

<p>There will be other cases where embedded URLs are to protected resources.
