<p>Hey all sorry for the spam, but this is the group I think could bring incredible talent and skill to the problems we are facing.</p>
<p>Protenus is seeking a Senior Health Data Engineer to help prevent the violation of patient privacy and stem the abuses of prescription medicine within health systems. Our solution presently works directly with the major EHR systems but as we look to provide health compliance analytics to the whole industry, FHIR knowledge and skill will become increasingly valuable. If you are someone with a strong background in health data, particularly with systems like Cerner Powerchart and Epic Clarity, with an interest and enthusiasm for interoperability and strong software development practices, please apply: <a href="https://grnh.se/9f6a5f7a2" target="_blank" title="https://grnh.se/9f6a5f7a2">https://grnh.se/9f6a5f7a2</a></p>
