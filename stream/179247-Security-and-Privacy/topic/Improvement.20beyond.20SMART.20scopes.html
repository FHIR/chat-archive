<p>The SMART-on-FHIR project has a fantastic starter set of scope patterns. But these scopes are considered too basic. There are many proposals for improvement that were submitted to the SMART-on-FHIR ballot in HL7. These proposals have been deferred, and would be input for this improvement opportunity. There are also many proposals that have been created as part of various projects.  Please catalog here your scope needs, and your scope proposals.</p>

<p>I would like to see the community resolve the current differences in how scopes have been implemented today first. After that, we'd look to making further changes to scopes.</p>
<p>1. Epic requires <code>.search</code> and <code>.create</code> scopes for search and create requests, respectively. The SMART on FHIR specification uses <code>.read</code> and <code>.write</code> for these types of requests. We should have a discussion as to why Epic went that route and if all other vendors should also implement scopes in that matter.</p>
<p>2. Cerner disagrees with wildcard scopes on two fronts: the encourage app developers to request more data than necessary and we feel providers + patients should not be asked to share all current and future data with the app (this is incredibly broad and Cerner feels users should not be asked for something so sweeping, nor will they likely understand what it means). While Cerner's implementation is not contrary to the SMART on FHIR specification, we should have a discussion as to if wildcard scopes should be removed from the specification.</p>
<p>After these two topics have been resolved, I think it would be great to explore other changes to scopes.</p>

<p>I'm kicking myself for not raising my concerns with wildcard scopes last year. At the time, since our implementation was still compliant with the SMART spec (as you don't have to support all of the scopes), I didn't think it was a problem. However, I realize I should have spoken up as I think wildcard scopes promote implementations and user experiences that do not have good security (data privacy) practices in mind.</p>

<p>i think this is particularly acute while the scopes are so technical. I just want my PHR to have everything I can get... I think most patients would assume that they can say this about their own personal store of data. And I think that Cerner is looking at patient trust the wrong way around about this. I could ask SPM for opinions, I guess</p>

<p>I can write up a detailed write up as to our position. I think we're approaching this very rationally.</p>
<p>There is also a very easy alternative to wildcard scopes -- an app can simply explicitly request each scope they want! For new scopes a FHIR server adds in the future, the app can request those too and the user will be re-prompted to authorize that new scope.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> we broke ours down by interaction, which was long enough ago I don't know why we did not bring this up as a comment. If I were to make a ballot item about it now I'd say scopes should be interaction based as it provides a clear representation of what a client is able to do.  Does write  = create, update, delete? Does read = read or read = read, search?</p>

<p>Josh's Github example is not an analog. Yes, when you grant a Github app access to your repositories, it is to all of your current + future repositories. However, that's like saying you grant a SMART app access to patient/AllergyIntolerance.read -- all of your current + future allergies. Github's permissions cannot be granted wildcard access to a 3rd party app.</p>

<p>I don't understand that. Sure, the client asks for it.... but the authorization server then asks the patient... what..? and if the patient doesn't get asked about it, why differentiate it?</p>

<p>Yeah I get that - the patient only cares at a content and read/write level. But I think there is another piece in there for a lot of our workflows - where before a patient or provider sees an app, a healthcare organization has said I'd like to "buy"/"install"/"share" this app, what does it want to do. Ex: The organization decides to make an app available to providers via an embedded SMART app - why does it need "Patient.search" when it is only ever launched from a patient's chart? Or I want to advertise a patient facing app to my organization's patient population - it should be able to file patient entered meds but not update existing ones.</p>

<p>ok so you're talking about organization authorization at registration... that makes more sense. Which reminds me... both Epic and Cerner agree on the scopes at registration, right? what the app asks for at authorization time has to be the same? or is ignored? either way, this is part of the app registration question</p>

<p>For Cerner:</p>
<p>Provider apps: Yes, we agree on scopes between Cerner &amp; the app at registration time. What the app is granted at launch is an intersection of what the app asks for + what the registration scopes are.</p>
<p>Patient apps: The scopes are defined by the app at registration time. What the app is granted at launch is an intersection of what the app asks for + what the registration scopes are. In the future, we will allow patients to selectively choose the scopes granted which means that this will be a further set in that final intersection.</p>
