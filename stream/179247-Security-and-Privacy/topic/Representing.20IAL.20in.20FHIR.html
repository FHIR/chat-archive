<p>Is there a well defined pattern for representing identity assurance level on a FHIR Patient resource?</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/issues/1">https://github.com/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/issues/1</a> discusses two ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>custom extension;</li>
<li>apply a security label borrowing from the <a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationValue">http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationValue</a> Code System -- but that seems like a funny code system to be using in a security label, since it's documented as "HL7-defined values for the Observation value element, when it has a coded datatype"</li>
</ul>
<p>Any advice (here on on the GH issue) would be appreciated (FYI <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> ).</p>

<p>I presume you mean specifically IAL? As in to what level of assurance has the Patient resource been confirmed to be specifically the identified human? This is the level of assurance of the identity provisioning. (Distinct from the AAL, which is the assurance that the user has been authenticated for the purpose of a transaction/action/etc.).</p>

<p>Unfortunately NIST 800-63 defines the concept of IAL, and does define some levels by number; BUT they did not define a vocabulary. They tend to stay away from declaring vocabulary as that is seen as outside their scope.</p>

<p>If this hasn't come up in FHIR before, I think using a dedicated extension is fine, but I'm open to any other suggestions! e.g., is an ad-hoc <code>.meta.security</code>label better than an ad-hoc extension?</p>

<p>Wouldn't that be an assertion per Patient.identifier?  I.e. they might have definitively been shown to be person with drivers license number X, but not passport Y?  If so, extension seems like the only way.</p>

<p>Generally the NIST guidance assigns an IAL to the overall identity proofing step -- so like if I check your name and dob based on two forms of ID that you provide, I can say I did an "IAL-2" identity proofing.</p>

<p>I would tend to believe that an organization defines a policy for how they proof to 1, 2, and 3. That policy indicates what is looked at, what procedure is executed, and who is allowed to do the work. This is a policy.  There is also the complexity of multiple organizations using a shared Patient resource registry, thus each might have proofed.</p>

<p>In the new DS4P IG that Kathleen is creating, she is adding extensions available for explaining who applied a specific .meta.security vocabulary value. This is needed for the CUI codes, as it is important to know who marked something later when someone else wants to remove that mark.  That extension could be used to indicate who applied the IAL indicated. <br>

<p>which lead me back to the Integrity codes... I wonder if your use-case can use the integrity confidence codes? reading them, and thinking about how they are intended to apply as <a href="http://meta.security">meta.security</a> and what that means about the elements in tagged Resource... it seems really close (might be not close enough)<br>

<p>put all that together... you could use the IAL codes defined in LDAP, use them on the <a href="http://Patient.meta.security">Patient.meta.security</a>, and if people want to meta-the-meta they can use the extensions from DS4P...</p>

<p>For health cards, the answer to "who determined IAL" question is basically: the organization that performed the clinical service (immunization), because if you weren't confident in the patient's identity at that point, nothing that happens later can achieve a stronger binding to the Identity </p>
<p>You mentioned "codes defined in LDAP", but just to be clear, which codes are these?</p>
<p>I also share your concern that <a href="http://meta.security">meta.security</a> doesn't "feel right" for this kind of information about a Patient IAL, but I'm willing to squash that concern if there's a clear recommendation to use it.</p>

<p>So Josh, you're saying that the assertion about identity of the patient would be made on the Immunization?  In that case, would it be an extension on the Reference type?  (And presumably you'd want the reference to be version-specific?)</p>

<p>While I am working on a MVP for Vaccination IG security requirements on <a href="https://pahisp.org">https://pahisp.org</a> I am planning on having the patient use a persistent XML XADES signature validated by ETSI based on what was developed at CMS ESMD by Bob Dieterle to prevent medical device fraud. That doesn’t address the IAL issue directly. However 800-63 doesn’t map internationally. Passports do work internationally and come under the UN trust framework ICAO with Country level PKI digital certificates.  The source of the data such as a Pharmacy or Provider is known to the patient and in my case I uploaded a photograph of the CDC shot card into an Epic EHR and then downloaded it to Apple IPhone Health App. On the back end there could be a validation step against the vaccine registry which already is using HL7 v2.</p>

<p>I think that your use-case is indeed what a <a href="http://Patient.meta.security">Patient.meta.security</a> tag of the  IAL would address. The IAL is a tag indicating the the data within the Patient have been assessed as level X. I disagree with Dave, this is about the data in the Patient resource.</p>

<p>One of the use-cases that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="199026">@k connor</span> has been working on for the FHIR DS4P IG is to be able to assign a security label  to a subset or an attribute of a resource. I think this perfectly fits in that use-case; we need a security label (in this case from the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-security-label-ds4p/branches/master/ValueSet-valueset-trust.html">Trust valueset</a> which includes the LOA values) scoped at the particular patient identifier, the entire identifier block, or a reference. <br>
This is not in the build yet but we have thought about two alternatives for doing this: either defining a standard security label extension that can appear anywhere in the resource, or defining a <code>scope</code> extension for the security labels in <code>meta.security</code>with a FHIRPath expression (or an array thereof) to specify where in particular a security label applies to.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the Patient in the Bundle can be stored and then linked to all sorts of other things.  It seems to me that the assertion you're trying to make is the strength of the linkage.  I.e. "I'm very confident that the person I jabbed in the arm and pushed the plunger on is indeed the person with this name, gender and date of birth".  Other entries subsequently linked to that same Patient resource might not be nearly so certain.   Alternatively, you could put the stamp on the Bundle, not the Patient or Immunization, but then you'd somehow have to differentiate your confidence that "this was indeed the patient" from your confidence that "this was indeed the administering Practitioner".</p>

<p>Certainly in clinical workflows like administering a vaccine or medication, there is the procedural steps commonly called "The Five Rights". The "right patient" in the Five Rights is a Authentication step (AAL).  I don't say that there might not be some use to recording in the medication administration record the AAL steps taken by the practitioner executing the Five Rights. Typically there is a policy that indicates the process, and nothing happens unless all Five Rights (including Right Patient) are all executed to the satisfaction of the process.</p>

<p>The situation where a patient is given a drug, in an emergency room setting, where the patient is not able to be identified, are exceptions. I would expect that the Patient identity in that case is not Identity Assured. I would expect that the Five Rights process still checks that the drug is about to go into the patient with the wrist band that the drug is intended for.  Thus even in this case the IAL at the Patient resource level is what is needed.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> I think these are two separate valid concerns.

I may know for sure that the patient identified by name and drivers' license number was identity proof-ed at the time of check-in, but I may not be sure whether the person receiving a shot is the same patient because I didn't look at their ID. </p>
<p>However, I think the essence of all the of these cases is the level of confidence and trust in an attribute in a resource: the <code>name</code> or <code>identifier</code> on the patient resource, the contact information (e.g. "email or phone number was verified by call back"), or a reference that links a resource like Immunization a patient. </p>
<p>I think the general solution of being able to assign a trust security label to an attribute in a resource (i.e. a security label scoped at sub-resource level) can cover all of these cases.</p>

<p>We discussed this  a bit on the FHIR-Security call today. What we recognized is that there are two very different things that are needed by the original use-case ask.</p>
<ol>
<li>IAL of the Patient Resource. </li>
<li>AAL of the link between the Immunization activity record and the Patient Resource. How sure is it that the immunization activity being recorded has correctly selected the indicated Patient reference. This is authentication, not identity provisioning. Thus this is AAL, not IAL. But it is based on the IAL of the Patient (1).</li>
</ol>
<p>both of these seem to be needed. overall. The question is if they both must be recorded in the FHIR resources..  I had given the example of (2) being part of the process behind the Five Rigths. If you your procedure is strict, then recording that you followed the procedure with a (2) kind of record is not needed. The same can be said for (1), for example if a Patient Registry requires that the patient was highly proofed before they were given a Patient record, then the Patient resource does not need a (1).</p>
<p>So it is important to understand which of these is going to be variable within your data. If you know that (1) is going to vary within your data, then you need a way to record which value of (1) each Patient resource has been proofed at. If you know that (2) is going to vary within your data, then you need a way to record the (2) for each reference.</p>
<ol>
<li>can be handled with the <a href="http://Patient.meta.security">Patient.meta.security</a> with a valueSet of IAL vocabulary. This seems appropriate as it is "meta" about the contents of the "Patient" resource. The vocabulary is unclear, but the concept is clear. An IG specific vocabulary (which the vaccine-credentials project seems to be doing) seems reasonable. </li>
<li>seems this needs an extension on the Immunization.patient element to indicate the AAL of the patient binding to the Immunization activity. This would need a different vocabulary, as AAL is different from IAL. (Even though NIST 800-63 uses numbers for both). </li>
</ol>
<p>Further (2) is not security meta about the content of the Immunization.patient element; it is specifically an AAL of the linkage confidence. Thus this is not a general extension carrying .meta.security at the element level (which is a task that DS4P is likely to add). The AAL need is different.  </p>
<p>This (2) might be first needed in this Immunization use-case, but one could see that this is generalizable such that any Reference anywhere in FHIR might need some evaluation of level of assurance that the reference value given is absolutely correct. We surely expect that any Reference in FHIR is always highly sure, we all know mistakes happen. What is not clear is if there is a true generalized need for the FHIR DataType Reference to add a core extension for tracking the confidence of the reference values.</p>
<p>So, now that I have elaborated about the need for (1) and (2) theoretically... which ones are actually needed in the vaccine use-case, and which ones might be more generally needed? These both seem unusual to be needed as values, vs simply being baked into procedure/policy.</p>

<p>In the original ask, these are the same (or more precisely: they can be unified), by virtue of the the narrow scope of a Health Cards bundle (includes a patient and the immunizations given for that patient, as signed by a single issuer).

<p>In forming a response, I'm curious to hear what the relying party hopes to do with this information (for example, who needs to know that FHIR data is associated with an IAL2-proofed person and how does that change how they use the information? would there be a reason to exceed typical system of record type requirements?). I'm aware of other use cases where level of identity assurance is important when coming from a client app (individual access request without portal credentials on the system) or knowing the identity of the institution securing the data (a proxy for provenance/confidence in the data).</p>

<p>The goal is to convey how closely a vaccination record is tied to an individual identity. Some verifying parties might decide they are willing to trust these records at IAL1, and others might set a higher threshold.

<p>Adding an identity assurance level to the resource seems like a good idea in general. We have talked about similar questions in the FAST Identity tiger team so some of those materials might be relevant to your use case. It seems knowing the assurance level would soon be followed with the question "what is the verified name, DOB, &amp; DL# or passport #" of the identity this vaccination relates to (or do you not think so?). Related topic: the big vaccination supersites are not doing IAL2 today that I am aware of, so we probably want to also be able to express more granular levels including LoA-2 In Person which is certainly better than IAL1 (no proofing) but not as strong as IAL2. My point is: it may matter more to indicate which evidence and attributes have been verified, than to just know a level of assurance and having only IAL1 and IAL2 as options might not be as meaningful as other levels could be in the short term (happy to hear more &amp; try to help tho'!).</p>

Indeed there may be targets &lt;IAL2 that are still worth delineating from IAL1; that's a great point <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194368">@Julie Maas</span> . (Realistically we want a clear way to get at "did you check an ID at the visit where you administered the vaccine".)</p>

<p>I've been looking at this as an IAL1 vs IAL2 distinction, and my reading of the NIST guidelines suggests this isn't massively far off, but if there's a clearer or more accurate set of concepts we should consider using, that'd be A-OK (we just want to give issuers a way to codify their practices with a single well specified code on the Patient).</p>

<p>Interesting conversation.  I've been calling this (jokingly) this NIST "IAL 1.8"   Is ...more than 1 but less than a full 2.  Could be a "soft 2".  As <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194368">@Julie Maas</span> points out we really do not expect a true IAL2 at a vaccination site.</p>

<p>Regarding the difference between IAL1 and IAL2, I see a huge difference. IAL1 is self-asserted. According to 800-63A, the credential service provider does not verify or validate identity attributes. IAL2 requires either remote or in-person proofing with well-defined documentation requirements. IAL1 is unsuitable for establishing identity. That said, I agree IAL2 might be overkill in some use cases. But a level of assurance greater than self assertion is needed.</p>

<p>Jenni. That is the distinction that I have made between IAL of the Patient resource, vs AAL of the linkage between the Immunization record and that Patient resource. The AAL is session specific (authentication), vs the IAL which is identity proofing. It is very important to differentiate and be specific about what is being represented.</p>

<p>I think that is why Josh is focusing on IAL. The IAL of the Patient is critical, and that is what they recognize they need to accept that some patients will bring a government issued picture ID, thus able to get to IAL3; while other patients will not have access to that so might only be able to be assured to IAL2. Thus they need to record the actual IAL achieved.</p>

<p>That being said (this is intended to only be relevant to the vaccination record), I'm wondering how useful it would be to be able to express how (name, dob) is validated &amp; that could apply to this use case and then also to a record more generally. Presently DL or Passport might be indicated as the method for validating (name, dob). Later, IAL2 may be possible. Alan, your 1.5 for self assertions seems generous. John, I'm not seeing how IAL2 is done at a supersite, certainly not IAL3. Today they're LoA-2 In Person <em>maybe</em> because you also have to confirm the home address.</p>

<p>I see what you mean. Communities exist today which use LoAs only for identity assurance and not authentication; in that case they state "LoA-2 identity verification" (etc.) and do not then require an authenticator, so long as language is clear authentication level of assurance is not specified. Self asserted means I'm telling you my name and dob without substantiating that through evidence. LoA-2 In-Person means someone looked at me next to my photo ID to confirm my name, address and dob (plus this extra a,b,c part that's achieved by mailing notice to home address of record, verifying electronic account associated with me in records, etc). But address doesn't seem to be verified in the workflow as I understand from Josh. At any level of assurance, it's not as simple as what we are discussing here but I'm trying to distill down to the pieces of identity evidence involved so we are even in the right ball park...</p>

<p>This has been an enlightening discussion.  I'd been hoping to align with existing terms and practices to avoid this kind of ad-hoc-ery, but after reviewing this discussion, I'm thinking there's nothing "out there" that comes very close to what we want. Am I crazy to think the "low hanging fruit" would be essentially a coding system with values like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>code-a</code> "name and birthdate were self asserted"</li>
<li><code>code-b</code> "we checked some kind of ID or other evidence to verify name and birthdate"</li>
<li><code>code-c</code> "we checked a US state or nationally-issued photo ID to verify name and birthdate"</li>
</ul>
<p>... and we'd ask issuers to assign the "highest" value that applies?</p>

<p>Of course you're not :) I see how this makes sense if we can't meet the address verification piece. One question...what is an example of evidence that might fall under "code-b"? Birth certificate perhaps?

<p>I worry that none of the usage is going to be super precise; like, I can totally imagine a scenario where relying parties want to make this distinction and might have different rules, but how accurately are issuers really going to convey this nuance?

<p>Agree. It might be very useful to make a list of recommended code-b ("other") identity evidence if there were possibility of a little more structure though. For example: "confirm name and dob using NIST 800-63-3a strong or fair identity evidence that includes both items" (there are a few lists circulating &amp; additional guidance is expected to be forthcoming). This would also help rule out things like SSN on its own and show the relationship to that standard.</p>

<p>The challenge is that IAL 1 doesn't provide any indication of whether a vaccination checked IDs at all. I don't disagree with you that it's good enough for many relying parties, but it doesn't technically convey <em>any</em> binding between vaccine record and a person's identity.</p>

<p>Earlier we identified two new levels of assurance that seem relevant to vaccinations: b) name and dob verified through some evidence other than c) name and dob verified through a US driver's license or nationally issued passport.

<p>Those would be published in the Trustmark, which is just a URL that points out what the P and C values in the vot claim mean.<br>
For example, an IAL of 2 and an AAL of 2 would like   vot= P2C2" / vtm="https"//example.com/trustmark".  I dont think the C would apply at all in this use case since there is no password and no transaction.  That only makes sense in an OIDC/SAML login event.</p>

<p>I just checked with a senior in my family. To signup for a timeslot for COVID-19 vaccine, their identity was proofed by their healthcare provider portal login, which likely was proofed by way of a postal-mail challenge. This is when they filled out the typical medical questionnaires too. <br>
At the vaccine time, they were identity proofed by way of their state issued drivers license, and they did not have the REALID qualifying drivers license. procedurally this was likely quickly linked to the scheduled timeslot above. <br>
When the vaccine was administered they were asked to state their name, birthdate, and address. Typical of a "The Five Rights" process.<br>
They did observe few (one) person was filling out the forms on-site, so everyone knew to do the above steps prior to showing up. What level of authentication the one person registering on-site is unknown.<br>
So, none of this seems to fall nicely into the given IAL levels.    But we certainly know that healthcare accepts a much wider IAL in the name of safety and care for health.</p>

<p>This comment from LinkedIn (thanks for creating the post) is spot on, to my mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A requirement to achieve IAL2 before receiving any healthcare services including a vaccination cannot be mandated.  This is not like voting or getting a passport.  However, a HC provider needs to do their best to confirm the identity of the patient.  And public health needs to do their best to keep accurate vaccination records.  There will always be a number of people who can’t or won’t provide sufficient evidence around their identity.  And there will be those who provide fraudulent identity info.</p>

<p>on the security wg call, we concluded that healthcare needs to step forward and provide our own concepts of 'identity proofing'. This has been done in the past, but I don't know of anywhere that these discussions have moved into a standards organization. This discussion was specific to separate the Policy decisions for the various grouping, from the technical discussions on how to convey it and what the expectations are. We reminded ourself that NIST 800-63 is specific to Remote access to Information Technologies. It is neither intended for healthcare, nor intended for physical or telehealth situations. Thus alghough it is a useful model, it is not one that fits healthcare well.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span>  I agree healthcare needs its own model, but I don't think doing it in FHIR is a good idea.  Best to use standard non-healthcare specific identity constructs like vectors of trust and make a healthcare specific set of codes for healthcare there. Representations of identity should be compatible with things like OIDC, SAML and LDAP in my opinion.</p>

<p>Yes, that is what I was proposing. The need is a Policy Standard, much like NIST 800-63 is a policy standard. These policy standards then have implementations in technology such as FHIR.</p>

<p>Yes <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> after sleeping on it i think putting this info in the patient resource seems okay, but would like to suggest using the "vot" as a field name and define a health-specific Trustmark.

<p>interesting spec (vot). not sure that adding an extension for this is so much better of a solution than using the element that we already have for the purpose. the .meta.security is intended to hold integrity evaluations, there is a valueset available for this use in other contexts. We do have LOA codes in that valueset, we just have not added IAL codes into that valueset. So seems like this proposal for a vot extension seems unnecessary.<br>
Also, the IAL need is not a transaction, it is an assertion of fact. So I am also not sure it fits our need.</p>

<p>your 1.5 seems closer to a 1.2..  Is this really the set of criteria that people are willing to accept is higher than 1 ?  I am especially not liking</p>
<ul>
<li>a successful login wiht an associated account -- associated with what? Twitter? I think you mean a medical portal account?</li>
<li>a cryptographic key verification -- like a zero trust cert ? Just because I have a self-signed cert should not be useful for anything (PGP). Just because I have a TLS cert issued by lets-encrypt should not mean anything... I suspect you may have implied a certificate proof with certificate root in a trusted root (like Direct Trust).</li>
<li>Presentation of a state or federal (sp?) id.... if it is REALID , then doesn't that rise to IAL 2?  I think the gap is when that ID card is not REALID compliant. Right?</li>

<p>So in my simplest use case just to walk through the logic the subject makes an appointment (might be done by proxy that has some identifiers provided patient) and the data is further refined to a specific IAL level as required by the relying party.At the appointment the pharmacy or injection site  verifies ID for billing purposes and to create the CDC shot card while taking any other pertinent medical information such as allergies etc.</p>

<p>The output of that verification process is a shot card. </p>
<p>The patient photographs that and the lot # etc is entered into the EHR after upload through the patient portal. </p>
<p>At that point the patient is already registered with the provider and has a login.  </p>
<p>The binding of the patient and immunization record happens in the EHR at a sufficiently defined IAL to prevent liability in HIPAA context. Notably my smart on FHR application that I use notes that they are not HIPAA compliant. What was lost in translation, versus a HIPAA defined transfer of data? Seems like any data flow to a patient comes under HIPAA rules?</p>
<p>The provider processing the shot card data into FHIR has a reasonable IAL level expectation of identity quality and potentially verify the immunization encounter with the pharmacy /injection site out of band if necessary.  However the registry is the ultimate source of ground truth.</p>
<p>The patient then downloads the same data (now in FHIR format) as “self reported” and it is present in the smart on FHIR app and can be exported  I am assuming the connection to the provider was not spoofed.  That’s a big assumption considering recent personal testing and issues surrounding JWT token theft as well as general OWASP vulnerabilities. </p>
<p>At that point the patient/subject seals the FHIR data with a 800-63 identity since it was not included with the immunization resource.  The patient has the data, they have the provenance for the data in terms of an audit, and the next step is to digitally sign the data as the owner.  </p>
<p>Even a simpler approach would be to use Adobe scan for the shot card and apply a digital signature in Acrobat using a valid x.509v3 certificate to the image of the shot card.  Of course if the image is altered from the original they could sign garbage but that can be checked via a verification loop to the registry.  I don’t think identity is the problem here except it’s not passing through from the EHR so if this was done before the patient got the data, that would save the patient having to attest to it with additional steps. Personally signing the actual XML seems to be simplest.</p>

<p>I think the "Validation Requirements "  for IAL2 are what make it hard for organizations to call it a 2....  Here is an excerpt from: NIST 800-63-3 "The CSP SHALL validate each piece of evidence with a process that can achieve the same strength as the evidence presented. "  In the common case where a  driver's license is presented, but not really verified,  that would not count as a 2.  To count as a 2 the license verification process would need to be "STRONG" according to NIST.  The person inspecting the license would need training/technology to achieve a true 2.</p>

<p>Even in cases where some identity proofing is occurring,  such as showing a license, this rigor of document inspection is probably almost never occurring in practice.   I think IALs would be be mostly 1s and "1.5s" at any mass vaccination sites, with very few 2s.</p>

<p>Seems like  the discussion about representing IAL is more relevant to identity providers than actual  vaccination providers. </p>
<p>Certainly is relevant to validated vaccination credentials. </p>
<p>I am still looking to get a electronic validated vaccination list for my use case as an after the jab UX to build something at a specific  IAL level.  </p>
<p>I presented a valid but  non real ID DL at my two appointments which was acceptable. </p>
<p>I was able to get a print out from a different branch of the same pharmacy chain after presenting the same DL.  </p>
<p>So now I have the shot card, which the second pharmacist changed to add the phone number of the first pharmacy, some print outs of the vaccination record, another record from the original pharmacy, a Yellow Card from the 70’s they didn’t want to update and multiple failures of an unknown origin based on Credit KBA on their website to get anything electronically. </p>
<p>The data never made it to my provider EHR, still have check the state IIS.  I formerly had LOA3 credentials before NIST changed the standards to IAL.  It’s not clear to me that electronically,  exactly where validation is passed to the consumer for reuse.</p>

<p>I am learning more about the digital vaccination use case day by day and it has a lot of moving parts. Mostly it indicates the complexity in keeping the system open. Right now the use case involves FHIR data that is valid and sourced from the EHR because I photographed the CDC card and they loaded it into my personal record where there has been multiple forms of identification already. So I got the data from the Pharmacy and using the patient portal, uploaded it and then got the same data back. Is it suitable to use for a EU Covid-19 certificate or some kind of ZKP? It is self reported since my provider never got a fax from the Pharmacy. I have other options, I can convince EPIC to sign the Immunization Record first before I get it downloaded to Apple Health. The provider is supposed to have a bilateral data relationship with the State IIS, so they can validate the Immunization Resource or I can work on the Pharmacy to Provider Link. I can also walk a copy of the Pharmacy vaccination history over to my provider but is the FHIR record still self reported? </p>
<p>It is very likely Epic and Cerner are planning to send  signed data to me which is a vast improvement if it is usable in the right format  and I can keep the validation linked to my identity to create the European Covid-19 certificate.  My goal however is to take the patient obtained XML and sign just the relevant parts for data minimization. Right now Xades XML signatures.  Then present it using Verified Credentials and possibly ZKP. I also could reach the necessary IAL by convincing the stakeholders to put in a e-passport and real Id reader to merge the Pharmacy  data into a VC and then package it or use ISO Micov digital id for those who wanted a EU compatible object with ID verification and the immunization record.</p>

<p>There is not specific IAL/AAL in SMART; I would expect it to come from the OpenID-Connect, as that is the authority for identity and authentication. SMART is focused on authorization.</p>

<p>SMART profiles OIDC and indeed any standardized properties can be included as claims in an id_token. But the doc John referred to is quite new, so in addition to the limitation he identified, I also wouldn't expect to see real world support for such capabilities in SMART enabled EHRs anytime soon. This would likely need quite a bit of consensus work.</p>
