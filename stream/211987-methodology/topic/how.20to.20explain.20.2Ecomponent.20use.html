<blockquote>
<p>Some comments have been received expressing that Observation.component should not be used. Yet the IG was designed following the rules of when .component is allowed to be used. (see <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-35612">FHIR-35612</a> ). There are three Observation profiles in the radiation dose IG that really do need to use .component as the values recorded are not useful on-their-own. How should the fact that the IG was properly designed to properly use .component be expressed so that the reader understands that the use of .component was not improper? Do we need to have a pattern of narrative explanation that is used consistently by all to indicate that they have properly designed the use of .component?</p>

<p>I don't know that there's standard language.  People yelling that "you're doing it wrong" isn't a typical problem.  And, as a rule, we try not to overload IGs with explanations of "why did we do it this way" unless it was unclear/controversial.  (If that information was captured, it would typically be in ElementDefinition.rationale in the differential - so it shows up if you wade through the data dictionary, but not in the main profile page.)</p>

<p>Yes, that is my concern. I can't think of a way to express that the use of .component was properly designed such that each time the IG goes to ballot it does not continue to receive these comments. Thus I was looking for guidance.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> did you mean .comment? I don't see a .rationale in ElementDefinition</p>

<p>Actually, I meant <code>.requirements</code></p>

<p>so, they chose to write a paragraph explaining the rational for using .component rather than individual Observations; and they put a .requirements on those slices that pointed to that paragraph.</p>
