<p>Please don't import comments that say "see comments submitted by xxx".  We should only be importing comments that are actually resolvable.  Importing comment lines that say "see spreadsheet" just adds unnecessary noise to the tracker.  The votes are captured in the ballot desktop (and will eventually be captured in the Jira BallotSubmission items.  There's no need to create specification feedback items for them.</p>
