<p>There is too much outstanding for it to be practical for us to start QA in less than 2 weeks.  FMG is preparing a document of what our alternative options are, reflecting the gap between volume of feedback we're getting and our capacity to address it.  We hope to have that out soon (days, not weeks) and will be seeking feedback from the community on it.</p>
<p>Please continue to push to get changes out, but adjust your priorities on the basis that the deadline is going to be at least a bit further out.</p>
