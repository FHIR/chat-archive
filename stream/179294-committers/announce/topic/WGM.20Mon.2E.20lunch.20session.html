<p>As has been our convention, the FMG will be holding a lunch session (12:45-1:30ish) in Salon 7 for FHIR content developers.  The focus of this particular session will be IG templates.  We're in the process of migrating the IG development process to us a standard HL7-defined template which should simplify some of the development process and also increase consistency in the look &amp; feel of HL7-produced IGs.  As we do that, we have the opportunity to introduce changes/improvements in the way the content of our IGs is consumed (filenames, file organization, types of files used) as well as in how the resulting IGs look (colors, fonts, layouts, representations, etc.)  We're soliciting feedback as well as examples of what you'd like to see - both what you want to keep as well as proposed changes.</p>
<p>Grab your lunch before you come.</p>

<p>The topic for this Monday's lunch will be the new HL7 FHIR template, its associated documentation and free discussion about timelines for transition (as well as feedback on what's there and what's not yet there).  As per usual, grab your lunch and bring it to the meeting room.  Discussion will begin ~ 12:45</p>
