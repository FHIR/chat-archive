<p>@All we are having some challenges with the use of the FHIR Logo and the HL7 logo on IGs outside HL7. I'm re-iterating the policy here:</p>
<ul>
<li>the FHIR icon can be used in an IG resulting by any project from hl7 or affiliate or accelerator that is going to HL7 ballot, or by written permission</li>
<li>the HL7 icon can be used by any project from hl7 or accelerator project when preparing an IG that is going to HL7 (note: Affiliates use their own icon, not the base HL7 icon)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the IG is not on ballot track at HL7 (whether it's an HL7 project or not) then it can't use the HL7 icon at all. It can use the FHIR icon, but I need to grant written permission for that. </p>
<p>There are a number of external organizations cloning our fhir IGs (for templates) and running with the resulting output, without removing the HL7 icon, or the FHIR icon. If you are aware of these IGs, please convey this policy to them. HL7 is very sensitive to IGs claiming HL7 approval when HL7 approval has not been sought (via ballot, which is our only way to approve things)</p>
<p>Note: there'll be a new icon shortly, a FHIR community Process icon, which we will be encouraging non-HL7 IGs to sign up for.</p>

<p>So we have several Argo guides that are not going to ballot  - they need to remove the HL7 logos right?  but can still use the fhir icon right?  and we need a need new Argo logo without HL7 in it?</p>
