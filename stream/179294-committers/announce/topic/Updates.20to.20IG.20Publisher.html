<p>I'm starting the process to push out a new version of the IG publisher. In this version, I'm redoing the algorithm I use to generate target links for element definitions. </p>
<p>I've tested it on several IGs but I don't have a closed box for this problem  - so it's possible that conditions I haven't encountered while testing. </p>
<p>The upshot of this is that you may suddenly get new broken links on the Ci-build. if you do, don't freak out, but don't say nothing either - bring them to my attention ASAP.</p>
