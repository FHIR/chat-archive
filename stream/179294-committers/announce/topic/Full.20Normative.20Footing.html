<p>I have a PR processing now that moves FHIR to a full normative footing. What this means is that the artifacts no longer identify themselves as being balloted as normative, but actually being normative. There's been a lot of changes across the board to make this happen. Please check the standards status of your artifacts as you work with the specification. thx</p>
