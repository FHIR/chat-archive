<p>FMG has confirmed that the "freeze" deadline for the May ballot of FHIR R5 (both normative and STU ballots) will be at midnight, Eastern on Sunday March 6. This is just over a week earlier than the regular ballot freeze deadline A 2-week QA period will then follow, followed by a short period for applying corrections prior to ballot opening.</p>
<p>All work groups need to work to get caught up on resolving and applying core tracker items before this date. Prioritization should be as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Substantive changes to normative and normative candidates</li>
<li>Substantive changes to non-normative artifacts</li>
<li>Non-substantive changes to normative and normative candidates</li>
<li>Non-substantive changes to non-normative artifacts</li>
</ol>
<p>Priority #1 issues MUST be dealt with before the freeze deadline. In theory, priority 2+ issues can be dealt with as part of ballot reconciliation. However, it's best to get as many of them as possible applied prior to then. If there are key changes that will NOT be made prior to ballot, those should be highlighted in the specification prior to ballot</p>
