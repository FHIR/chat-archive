<p>In case some might not be aware, FHIR Infrastructure has a long-running "workflow" project that has a mandate to provide guidance and improve consistency around how workflow is implemented using FHIR.  I.e. how is FHIR used when orchestrating business processes, exchanging data between systems, asking for activity to occur, etc.  There's a <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html">section</a> in the core specification dedicated to this.  As well, the workflow project has a <a href="#narrow/stream/179196-workflow" title="#narrow/stream/179196-workflow">stream</a> here on <a href="http://chat.fhir.org" target="_blank" title="http://chat.fhir.org">chat.fhir.org</a> and we have weekly conference calls on Mondays from 2-3 Eastern.  We invite projects developing IGs that have questions around workflow or that are implementing "novel" workflows to share what they're up to and/or to ask questions.</p>
