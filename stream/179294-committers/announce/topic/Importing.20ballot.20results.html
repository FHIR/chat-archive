<p>For those of you who have ballots that just closed and are wondering how to get the spreadsheet contents into Jira, I've written up some documentation that explains the process.  It's been executed successfully several times, but there are undoubtedly creative balloters out there that will find ways to make the process unhappy.  Let me know if you have issues and I'll help as best I can.  Documentation is here: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Importing+ballot+results+from+spreadsheets" target="_blank" title="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Importing+ballot+results+from+spreadsheets">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Importing+ballot+results+from+spreadsheets</a><br>
Issues should be raised on <a href="#narrow/stream/184932-JIRA.2FConfluence" title="#narrow/stream/184932-JIRA.2FConfluence">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/184932-JIRA.2FConfluence</a></p>
