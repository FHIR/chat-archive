<p>I believe I've fixed the issue with the IGPublisher incorrectly warning about differences between the 'generated' Jira file and the one in Github.  As part of the fix, I improved the generation process so that pages and artifacts are now listed alphabetically by name - which should be more intuitive/less confusing to submitters.  That means that before you can make the warning go away, you'll have to re-gen your IG and make a pull request to update the Jira-Spec-Artifacts file (called FHIR-[your ig id].json).  Note that <em>all</em> IG authors should be doing this as it will make it easier/more precise for users submitting change requests.  Discussion on the non-announce stream please.</p>
