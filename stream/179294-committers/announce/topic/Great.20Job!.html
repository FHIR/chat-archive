<p>At today's FMG call, we had scheduled time to block vote to defer all of the remaining ballot items from the Sept. FHIR STU ballot that had not yet been reconciled (as we've had to do for all STU ballots in the past).  I was pleasantly surprised to find that there <strong>weren't any</strong> :)  Thanks to everyone for getting these cleaned up so I can post the reconciliation spreadsheet tonight.</p>
