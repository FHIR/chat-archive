<p>Hello, Could you advise me on how to model the patient assistance program information on FHIR?</p>
<p>Use Case<br>
The patient was enrolled in the PAP. We have a system (FHIR server) that contains this data (program name, enrollment date, relation with patient, etc.). How can I organize the exchange for this information based on FHIR? What type of resource can I use for that (info about PAP for a patient)?</p>
<p>I know about general resources (Patient, MedicationRequest, Condition, Coverage for Insurance info), my question about a suitable FHIR resource for information about a specific assistance program for a certain patient.</p>
