<p>Hi @Isaac Vetter , @Daniel Zhang<br>
We've been thinking about how to address the typical pharmacy's challenge of locating the right endpoint for patient info associated with a prescription they receive through an intermediary... while enabling EHRs to participate in a standard, RESTful way.</p>
<p>To accomplish that, we've added a RESTful Data Source role to the IG. An EHR server fulfilling this role could respond to searches submitted directly by the pharmacy in a direct-connect mode, but we expect it will more often interact with an intermediary that...</p>
<ul>
<li>receives a pharmacy's request message</li>
<li>locates the right EHR endpoint</li>
<li>performs a patient match based on info in the request</li>
<li>performs the pharmacy's requested searches </li>
<li>and then returns the results in a response message back to the pharmacy.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is described <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-specialty-rx/branches/master/workflow.html">here</a> in the IG</p>
<p>Very interested in your thoughts!</p>
