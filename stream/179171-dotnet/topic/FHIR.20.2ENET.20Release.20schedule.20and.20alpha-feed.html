<p>Now we have released 1.0.0-beta, we are going to try to structure our process of doing releases similar to Rust (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/appendix-06-nightly-rust.html" target="_blank" title="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/appendix-06-nightly-rust.html">https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/appendix-06-nightly-rust.html</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>We will release a new version of the library on NuGet every 6 weeks. At the moment we release 1.0.0-final, we will also release a 1.1-beta</li>
<li>Six weeks later, we will release 1.1 final, and release 1.2-beta, etcetera.</li>
<li>This way we have 6 weeks to catch blocking issues and create hotfixes before we release the final version.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these beta and final releases, we now have an alpha-feed containing the NuGets built from each merged PR. This means that if you donate a PR and we pull it, you will have an alpha-build with your fix ready in about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Of course, this would contain other alpha-level features too, so be aware. You can find this alpha-feed here: <a href="https://www.myget.org/F/fhir-net-api/api/v3/index.json" target="_blank" title="https://www.myget.org/F/fhir-net-api/api/v3/index.json">https://www.myget.org/F/fhir-net-api/api/v3/index.json</a>.  As you can see, we keep alpha releases out of the main NuGet repository, so we do not confuse users that are not interested in alpha-level releases.</p>
