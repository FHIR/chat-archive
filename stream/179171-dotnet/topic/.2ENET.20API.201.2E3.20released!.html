<p>First off, congratulations to us all as a community: the .NET API NuGet packages have surpassed the magic 1M downloads mark, thanks to your continued support and enthousiasm.  The Firely team really enjoys supporting this project that is obviously useful to a lot of us!</p>
<p>As a bonus, we'd like to announce that we have just released the new 1.3.0 version of the FHIR .NET API.  This is mostly a bugfix release, but we have also included noteable new functionality like support for validating custom resources and performance improvements for the DirectorySource. You can read the full releases notes <a href="http://docs.simplifier.net/fhirnetapi/releasenotes.html" target="_blank" title="http://docs.simplifier.net/fhirnetapi/releasenotes.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, you can find the binary distribution on <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hl7.Fhir.STU3/1.3.0" target="_blank" title="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hl7.Fhir.STU3/1.3.0">NuGet</a> and the sources for the master branches on <a href="https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhir-net-api" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhir-net-api">GitHub</a>.</p>
