<p>I am working on a project that requires the use of the API v0.95.0.  The NuGet package Hl7.Fhir.Specification.STU3 is installed.</p>
<p>I am struggling to pass tests of the most simple of validations.  </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>    // Arrange
    // .. code to create Organization resource
            var zipSource = ZipSource.CreateValidationSource();
            var validationSettings = new ValidationSettings()
            {
                ResourceResolver = zipSource,
                GenerateSnapshot = true
            };

            var validator = new Validator(validationSettings);

    // Act
    var outcome = validator.Validate(organizationResource);

    // Assert
    outcome.Success.Should().BeTrue();
</pre></div>


<p>I encounter the following issue:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>{&quot;Overall result: FAILURE (1 errors and 0 warnings)
[ERROR] Unable to resolve reference to profile
&#39;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Organization&#39; (at Organization)&quot;}
</pre></div>


<p>I anticipated the Validator would have, by default, used the specification.zip file included in the Hl7.Fhir.Specification.STU3 package.</p>
<p>Any help to identify what I'm omitting or doing incorrectly is appreciated.</p>

<p>This obstacle disappears when i create a new console project.  I believe I have something else going on in my code.</p>

<p>Looks like your code is right, maybe the specification.zip isn't in the runtime folder where it runs and therefore isn't able to use it.</p>

<p>Thanks for your input Brian.</p>
<p>I have corrected this.  The obstacle to validating turned out to be the presence of conflicting NuGet packages for Newtonsoft.Json and System.ValueTuple; the Fhir packages depended on different versions than the code base I was working with.  </p>
<p>These conflicts presented as warnings rather than build errors.  I made the error of discounting the importance of these warnings.  </p>
<p>When I took the time to address these conflicts, the validation worked just fine.</p>
