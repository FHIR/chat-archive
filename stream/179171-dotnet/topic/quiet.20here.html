<p>Things have been a little quiet here in the dotnet stream for a while...<br>
Just to let you all know that there has beeb quite a bit of activity going on in the background, I've recently pushed to GitHub a fhirpath tester project <a href="https://github.com/brianpos/FhirPathTester" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/brianpos/FhirPathTester">https://github.com/brianpos/FhirPathTester</a><br>
The FHIR Client itself has beeb getting a lot of love from our dedicated contributors, the profile validation is well under way and quite stable (thanks Ewout), the Snapshot Generator is going great (thanks Michel) and I've added support for Compression.<br>
We are expecting to publish a new NuGet package soon containing all this good work (all in DSTU2 by the way)</p>

<p>..but we are almost done. I just wrote a blog about what we have been doing over the past month, including the addition of the new .NET Profile validator.</p>
