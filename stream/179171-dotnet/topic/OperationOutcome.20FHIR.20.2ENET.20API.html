<p>Hello all.</p>
<p>I am currently working on a basic FHIR client (ASP.NET) and would like to display the results of a transaction in a simple memo style text box. An example would be the success message when a new patient resource is created. I am able to create a patient resource with the following code:</p>
<p><a href="http://ewoutkramer.github.io/fhir-net-api/client-crud.html" target="_blank" title="http://ewoutkramer.github.io/fhir-net-api/client-crud.html">http://ewoutkramer.github.io/fhir-net-api/client-crud.html</a></p>
<p>var pat = (Patient)FhirParser.ParseResourceFromJson(jsonString);<br>
var patEntry = client.Create(pat);</p>
<p>"Most FHIR servers will return a human-readable error description in the OperationOutcome to help you out"</p>
<p>I am looking to add a few lines of code to capture and show the HTTP response message from the server showing success (or failure) on my client page.</p>
<p>Using the .NET API, how would I capture and display this information as a simple HTML string? I have been researching for quite some time and still unsure if I am on the right track. It looks like I need to focus on the "OperationOutcome" class, but I am just not sure of the syntax.</p>
<p>Any ideas or help?</p>
<p>Thank you! -- Thomas K.</p>

<p>what version of FHIR are you using? </p>

<p>You might get some inspiration from this<br>

<p>(Grahame) - Currently I am using the "DSTU-2" build of the following project. Is this the information you are looking for? I am sure these is a more robust version / build number, however I am not too sure where to locate that information as I am still in the learning phase on this technology / spec.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/furore-fhir/spark/tree/dstu2/master" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/furore-fhir/spark/tree/dstu2/master">https://github.com/furore-fhir/spark/tree/dstu2/master</a></p>
<p>(Brian) - Thank you for the link. I am going to look further into the code provided as suggested and see what I can come up with.</p>
<p>One thing I have noticed is that many of the public testing sites (client pages) seem to have a VERY similar look / layout for performing searches, updates, etc. Perhaps playing around with my own client code is not necessary if an open source client exists? I will continue my research and see if I even need to really be going down this path. I just like to know how things work, thus building my own "play" client using the .NET API.</p>
<p>Thank you both again and I will be in touch. Just need to keep researching I think.</p>
