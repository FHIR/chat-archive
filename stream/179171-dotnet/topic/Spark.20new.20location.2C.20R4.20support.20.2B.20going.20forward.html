<p>The official site for Spark has moved to <a href="http://spark.kufu.no" target="_blank" title="http://spark.kufu.no">http://spark.kufu.no</a>, FHIR endpoint: <a href="http://spark.kufu.no/fhir" target="_blank" title="http://spark.kufu.no/fhir">http://spark.kufu.no/fhir</a>, endpoint is currently running STU3.</p>
<p>I am working on R4 support for Spark and there is an early version in the r4/develop branch which can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/FirelyTeam/spark/tree/r4/develop" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/FirelyTeam/spark/tree/r4/develop">https://github.com/FirelyTeam/spark/tree/r4/develop</a></p>
<p>I would like to point out that although the source code is hosted on Firely's GitHub it does not mean that Firely has any responsibilities for the development or moving the software forward that is now done by me as an independent software developer.</p>
<p>For anyone who wants to chime in and help please see the contributing section in the README :)</p>
