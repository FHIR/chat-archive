<p>I am developing a feature in our clinical software to access a FHIR server. Our development is done in C# .NET targeting .NET Framework 4.7.2. We use Visual Studio 2017 as our development environment. Our final production builds are done using MSBuild in an automated build process on a separate build vm.<br>
I have incorporated the FHIR R4 DLLs into our Visual Studio solution. This builds perfectly well in Visual Studio with no problem.</p>
<p>However, the automated MSBuild comes up with errors relating to a version mismatch with the FHIR DLLs.<br>
*C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Microsoft.Common.targets(1605,5): warning MSB3258: The primary reference "Hl7.Fhir.Serialization" could not be resolved because it has an indirect dependency on the .NET Framework assembly "System.ValueTuple, Version=4.0.3.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51" which has a higher version "4.0.3.0" than the version "4.0.2.0" in the current target framework.
*</p>
<p>I am hoping that someone might have some insight as to why this is happening. Any assistance would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Have you tried comparing to other projects that use them, like the fhirpathtester and see if that builds in your environment.<br>
I build heaps of projects in Azure build infrastructure and haven't had issues.<br>
Do you have an issue with binding redirects in your app.config or web.config?</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply Brian. Your comments led me to the path that eventually solved my puzzle. It turned out that we were using an old version of MSBuild. Once I changed to a newer version, my problems disappeared. Thanks again.</p>
