<p>I worked as a volunteer and head of a developing chapter in Brazil, and Hacking Health taught me a lot.<br>
It's interesting to see how open innovation can speed things up, but my feeling is that it was a long time before ideas were converted into something material.<br>
I don't know how the movement is today, apparently they are moving towards a better structuring. The HL7 + HH combination can be a phenomenal tool of change.</p>

<p>The interest in HH in Australia was significantly eroded because there were great ideas, but almost all of them required real integration, and that wasn't possible in the HH framework</p>

<p>I reached out the HH people in hte past to see if we can work together on DevDays, but they weren't very responsive.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191354">@Rien Wertheim</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>,  yes, all what you say is true.<br>
I worked with the movement for about three years and I can say (from within) what moves them.<br>
The movement is purposely disorganized because it assumes that people can benefit from it.<br>
Even more boldly, I always wanted to understand why there were no pre-leveling activities or whatever, but then I noticed that the issue is in the absolute openness of the volunteer mind.<br>
The consequences are as bizarre as possible. Illegal or unethical solutions between.<br>
Only it changes people, and I saw the modifying power that movement leaves behind.</p>
