<p>Hello, I am mapping FHIR DiagnosticReport and Observation resources into Results Section in the Continuity of Care Document and I have two questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, Result Organizer (<a href="https://hl7.org/ccdasearch/templates/2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.1.html">https://hl7.org/ccdasearch/templates/2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.1.html</a>) requires one classCode from CodeSystem: HL7ActClass 2.16.840.1.113883.5.6 STATIC. There are many codes in this system. How can I recognize which classCode should I use when mapping FHIR resources into Result Organizer? I found examples with classCode="CLUSTER" and classCode="BATTER" but again, how to recognize which one should I use? Maybe it should be hardcoded into one of them?</li>
<li>Moreover, when parsing any FHIR resource into any CDA template, should we use the id of the FHIR resource to create an &lt;id /&gt; tag in the document or we should just stick to the identifier field and use only identifiers to create &lt;id /&gt; tags?</li>
</ol>

<p>So section 4.3.6.5 of the underlying CDA standard explains CLUSTER vs. BATTERY. It's something like this: BATTERY (battery) A battery specifies a set of observations. These observations typically have a logical or practical grouping for generally accepted clinical or functional purposes, such as observations that are grouped together because of automation. CLUSTER (cluster) A group of entries that have a logical association with one another. The Cluster class permits aggregation into a compound statement.</p>
<p>You can look in a large sample of C-CDA documents by multiple technologies for certification here: <a href="https://github.com/jddamore/ccda-samples/">https://github.com/jddamore/ccda-samples/</a> <br>
You can look at published results samples here: <a href="http://cdasearch.hl7.org/sections/Results">http://cdasearch.hl7.org/sections/Results</a></p>
<p>Ultimately, I don't think it will have a huge impact whichever you choose, but unless you need complex logical groupings, it may easier to just do BATTERY.</p>
