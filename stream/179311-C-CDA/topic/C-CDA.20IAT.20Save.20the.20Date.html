<p>Save the date! The next C-CDA Implementation-A-Thon (IAT) will be held on Wednesday, July 28, 2021. </p>
<p>The focus for July’s C-CDA IAT is “accelerating advances through collaboration and teamwork”.  We’ll be teaming across the Sequoia Data Usability Work Group, IHE, and DirectTrust to advance the use of the synthetic suite of documents created for demonstrating how C-CDA can be used to create more effective communication, enable closed-loop referrals and improved care coordination.  </p>
<p>Topics will include greater understanding about the International Patient Summary implementation guide, how to utilize the support processes within the CDA Community to address a challenge, and what is happening with a new initiative at HL7 to develop mapping guidance for C-CDA to and from FHIR.  The crowd favorite, Ask the ONC session will focus on the released version of USCDI V2 and new guidance about the ongoing evolution of the USCDI process. </p>
<p>Expect a summer field-day feel with team-building exercises that focus on building skills, knowledge and an appetite for collaboration that will help the CDA Community improve faster.</p>
