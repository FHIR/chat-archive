<p>Just a few questions as we are working through our tests on this...</p>
<p>In the PDF for the scenario....<br>
"e.  Entry Level Markings<br>
 i. Empancipation Age Finding of the patient has be marked with 'No Redisclosure with patient consent' "</p>
<p>Am I off on interpretation here, or shouldn't that likely read WITHOUT patient consent"?   Or is this saying even IF you get the patients consent, you can't redisclose it (although, that doesn't seem to fit with the rule?)</p>
<p>Secondly, the validator currently does NOT appear to be checking for the Emancipation Age, or the Entry level markings to place in that section... we are passing the test with just the general document level restriction setting, and the section for the document restriction, nothing involving "Emancipation Age" (which we don't even have in the document).</p>
<p>Is this accurate?   Is this just poor testing with the validator (at <a href="https://ett.healthit.gov/">https://ett.healthit.gov/</a>)... would the proctor likely be manually checking for that (at least until they get it in the validator)?</p>
