<p>Hi,</p>
<p>What code systems can be provided under Authorization Activity for authorized treatments?</p>
<p>C-CDA IG has this as description but not specific about code systems etc.<br>
Authorization Activity :<br>
[act: identifier urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.1.19 (open)]<br>
An Authorization Activity represents authorizations or pre-authorizations currently active for the<br>
patient for the particular payer.<br>
Authorizations are represented using an act subordinate to the policy or program that provided it. The<br>
authorization refers to the policy or program. Authorized treatments can be grouped into an organizer<br>
class, where common properties, such as the reason for the authorization, can be expressed.<br>
Subordinate acts represent what was authorized.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Ozlem</p>
