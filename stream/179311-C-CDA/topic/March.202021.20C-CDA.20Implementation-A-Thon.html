<p>March 24, 2021 will be the first of three C-CDA IAT’s to be offered by HL7 in 2021. It will be a full-day virtual event and promises to be one of the most relevant implementation-a-thons to date. Topics will be led by experienced implementers seeking to drive progress for CDA-based information exchange. The community will be tackling issues that cause challenges for implementers today. </p>
<p>Two of the topics focus on key use cases for C-CDA--one on using C-CDA documents in the NCQA Data Aggregator Validation and HEDIS measurement certification programs, and the other on using C-CDA documents to support closed-loop referrals and improve care coordination. The quality measure use case topic will feature a panel of experts and implementers discussing the good, the bad, and the improvement possibilities for C-CDA documents to support their use in quality measure programs. The closed-loop referral use case topic will describe a multi-year mission to align testing efforts across IHE, HL7, and DirectTrust to amplify the benefits and accelerate the progress achieved through implementer testing.</p>
<p>One topic address new data classes and elements in the Draft US Core Data for Interoperability  (USCDI) V2. It will help implementers identify areas where their comments and input could make a difference in this important national data standardization effort. There's also a topic led by ONC Representatives who make themselves available for questions from the implementer community. They will be talking about Certification, the ONC Scorecard, USCDI V2, and the new Real World Testing program launching in December. </p>
<p>Implementers also will get an update on the CDA Product Roadmap.  This is an opportunity for implementers to provide feedback on their priorities and views regarding the use of CDA R2.0 and the potential use of CDA R2.1.</p>
<p>Registration is open. Don't miss this fun and informative event designed specifically for the C-CDA implementer community. Sign up for the March 24th 2021 virtual event today. <a href="http://www.hl7.org/events/c-cda/implementation/2021/03/">http://www.hl7.org/events/c-cda/implementation/2021/03/</a></p>

<p>C-CDA Implementation-A-Thon <br>
March 2021 Executive Summary<br>
By Lisa R. Nelson, MS, MBA</p>
<p>The March 2021 C-CDA Implementation-A-Thon (C-CDA IAT) was held as a full-day virtual event on Wednesday, October 21st, from 10am to 6pm ET. This was the fourteenth running of the Implementation-A-Thon and our 3rd virtual event. </p>
<p>This IAT was well attended with 49 participants including program facilitators and topic presenters. Five EHR vendors sent representative: Allscripts, Cerner, e-Clinical Works, and Epic. Representatives from the Sequoia Project, Carequality, eHealthConnection, and CommonWell communities attended. Representatives from IHE International, SHIEC, the VA/DOD and SSA as well as representatives from the US Government participated as well. Optum participated from the payer communities. Two DirectTrust HISPs and DirectTrust executive leadership along with many integrators and innovators who utilize C-CDA in information exchange solutions also attended. </p>
<p>The March 2021 C-CDA IAT focused on two key use cases for C-CDA: quality measures and care coordination in the form of closed-loop referrals.  A panel of experts involved in using C-CDA for quality measurement discussed the growth of this use case. The group explored the some of the current challenges with data quality in C-CDA documents and offered specific recommendations about how to make changes that would lead to improvement. The group was introduced to a new care coordination use case that is being developed to raise the bar on using C-CDA to improve communication and care coordination between care team members. The use case focuses on the benefits of expanding a diabetic patient’s clinical care team to include eye care providers. It shows the use of additional types of C-CDA encounter summary documents such as Referral Notes to initiate referrals, Consultation Notes to close the communication loop between providers, Progress Notes to keep providers informed of ongoing care, and Care Plan documents to track the progress and outcomes of care.  The use case also includes the element of using C-CDA documents to share information with clinical data registries. The group creating the use case is working with IHE, HL7, and DirectTrust to utilize the patient story and the detailed clinical communications to advance testing of the 360X profile and demonstrate improvements in the way system consume and reuse information exchanged via C-CDA.</p>
<p>Other topics included a review of the new USCDI Version 2 data classes and elements, and Ask the ONC session, and an update on the CDA and C-CDA roadmaps from the CDA Management Group (CMG). The group reviewed potential issues with the draft USCDI V2 and showed implementers how to contribute their input before the April 18th deadline. The ONC presented progress for the USCDI expansion and the new standards version advancement process (SVAP), and entertained questions and feedback about requirements for the Real-World Testing program that will be at the end of 2021.  CMG delivered a strong message to the C-CDA Community regarding HL7’s ongoing commitment to the CDA R2.0 standard. They described the investments being made to sustain and advance CDA IG Publishing capabilities to make use of new FHIR IG tooling as part of HL7’s vision to focus the organization’s efforts on developing the new FHIR standard and align existing product families with those efforts.<br>
C-CDA IAT facilitators Jean Duteau, Joginder Madra and Lisa Nelson closed the day by thanking the ONC for sponsoring the event and thanking Natasha Kreisle for the amusing break-out slides inspired so much fun conversation and community building.  </p>
<p>It was announced that the next C-CDA IAT will take place as a virtual event on July 21st, 2021. Participants were encouraged to work on advancing the available guidance for implementers by contributing to the ongoing work of the C-CDA Examples Task Force which meets on Thursdays from noon – 1:00pm ET.  Conference calls for the group are announced on the <a href="http://HL7.org">HL7.org</a> Conference Call Center. The Zulip chat C-CDA Stream will be used to continue discussion on the topics introduced during the event. (<a href="#narrow/stream/179311-C-CDA">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179311-C-CDA</a>)</p>
<p>Dave Hamill reminded everyone how important and valuable the feedback surveys were to improving future IATs. The topic sign-up form for upcoming C-CDA IATs is already available on Confluence (<a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/IAT/Upcoming+IAT%27s">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/IAT/Upcoming+IAT%27s</a>). Topics for the July IAT need to be identified before June 15th, 2021. C-CDA IAT facilitators are available to help topic presenters develop and prepare their topic presentations.  Participants were encouraged to keep these conversations going via the C-CDA and CDA streams on <a href="http://Chat.fhir.org">Chat.fhir.org</a> and to save the date of October 20th, 2021 for a C-CDA IAT this Fall.</p>
