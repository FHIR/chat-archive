<p>Hi Lisa, I am also looking to provide the best place for Diagnostic Study Performed in CCDA  that can be used for CQM. I am thinking Procedure or Results section but there is also Procedures in CQM. So I am not sure if I need to look for some type of indicator to differentiate them somehow. (I am not clinical so I am not sure if they are too different at all either). Thanks for your time.</p>
