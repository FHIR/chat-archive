<p>There are three different procedure sections in CCDA...<br>
2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.14 (procedure) - This clinical statement represents procedures whose immediate and primary outcome (post-condition) is the alteration of the physical condition of the patient. Examples of these procedures are an appendectomy, hip replacement and a creation of a gastrostomy.</p>
<p>2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.13 (observation) - This clinical statement represents procedures that result in new information about the patient that cannot be classified as a procedure according to the HL7 RIM. Examples of these procedures are diagnostic imaging procedures, EEGs and EKGs.</p>
<p>2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.12 (act) - This clinical statement represents any procedure that cannot be classified as an observation or a procedure according to the HL7 RIM. Examples of these procedures are a dressing change, teaching or feeding a patient or providing comfort measures.</p>
<p>The splits for the most part make sense to me.</p>
<p>The question I have with them is, from a schematron/validation standpoint, is there any checking or "lists" (valusets?) of what codes are "valid" for each section?  Or is it more of a "the person making the document decides which 'bucket' they belong in"?</p>

<p>To be a bit more on point... if there is nothing schematically limiting it, then, there is nothing stopping someone from putting a "Hip Replacment" in the 22.4.12 section, or an EKG in the 22.4.14, etc.</p>
<p>I guess from that perspective, there are a lot of ways places can (and obviously do) make "poor" C-CDAs, and at a certain point, we can't "stop" them per se.   I just didn't know if this was an area where there are some (at least from a certification/validation standpoint) things that have been (or opinions on should be?) done?</p>
