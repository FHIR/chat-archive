<p>There is a new message that recently came up in Cures Update validation (as in, I passed with this file a few weeks ago, and now they appeared to add this new wrinkle in the last 2-3 weeks?)</p>
<p>"The scenario requires Provenance data of Time : 20150622 and an Organization Name of : Neighborhood Physicians Practice at the Document Level., which was not found in the submitted data."</p>
<p>I have that date and Org name many times in the CCDA, so it is unclear to me where it thinks the "Provenance data" is missing from (what section?).   Thank you!</p>
