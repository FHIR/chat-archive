<p>David Carlson is talking about a challenge he was facing to figure out how to represent a problem where the code for the issue in one code system requires multiple codes to be used to represent that same semantics in another code system.  Is this a common need that many implementers have?  Who else is considering how to do this?  Have you had a chance to look at the proposed solution in the C-CDA examples task force?</p>
<p>Here is the example that has been proposed to address this need:  <a href="https://cdasearch.hl7.org/examples/view/Problems/Problem%20Value%2C%20Translation%2C%20Qualifier%20examples">https://cdasearch.hl7.org/examples/view/Problems/Problem%20Value%2C%20Translation%2C%20Qualifier%20examples</a></p>
