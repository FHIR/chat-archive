<p>I am trying to contribute to the android-fhir but unable to understand the codebase. I have basic knowledge but I need to update it. Any suggestions.</p>

<p>The codebase is pretty well documented. I'll tell you my way of destructuring and reading the codebase: First start with the application, see on which activity/fragment you are standing, read what functions/features that screen supports(in our case it is questionnaire and answers to 'em, cql functionalities), click 'em one by one and each of 'em will have at least a single mention of 'em in the corresponding activity/fragment's kotlin file, read that file, <code>Ctrl + click</code> to navigate to the definition of a particular function/feature you want to understand, you can definitely add log statements with custom tags and run the application to understand the call sequence, i.e., which method is called when and you can also print the variables in logs to get a more clear understanding.</p>
<p>You can follow this in general, it has rarely disappointed me. If you're stuck at some point, you can definitely search it over the internet or read docs or youtube(whatever you prefer) there a bunch of good resources to learn stuff.</p>
