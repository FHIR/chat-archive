<p>A number of issues have been raised on the mCODE IG STU 1 version. The project team have begun to address them and will be scheduling a block vote in the CIC work group in the near future.  If there are any issues you would like to discuss individually, please let me know and I will pull them from the block.</p>
<p>Here is a query that will produce the same list as the enclosed in JIRA:</p>
<p>project="FHIR" AND Specification = "US Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) (FHIR) [FHIR-us-mcode]"  and "Raised in Version" = 1.0.0 and type = "Change Request" and Grouping = Block-Vote-1</p>
<p>Thank you! <a href="/user_uploads/10155/PAlRfalBguTjUbmm-GQfuit7/mCODE-Block-Vote-1-proposed-2020-11-09.xlsx">mCODE-Block-Vote-1-proposed-2020-11-09.xlsx</a></p>
