<p>Scheduling meeting that can be targeted at specific tasks and topics aside from the general Cancer-DTR meeting was brought up today.  This is something that most groups do and it works quite well. </p>
<p>I would suggest we consider a meeting specifically for modeling discussions around Breast and Lung.  When we are discussing more cross-cutting issues like Staging, that would be done with the entire group.</p>
<p>What does everyone think of this idea?</p>
