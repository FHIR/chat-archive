<p>Hi all, this is my first message in the community, I hope I'm posting the question in the right stream. I'm involved in a project that needs to track and show the different cancer stages a patient has been through. It seems that the Condition resource does not include any field for that. From your point of view, what is the best way of accomplishing this?</p>

<p>The Condition will convey the 'current' stage.  If you want to see past stages, you'd need to look at the 'history' of that Condition instance.</p>

<p>Thanks Lloyd, but I have not a clear view on how resource's 'history' should be handled. I mean, is it possible as per the standard specification to query the FHIR server for a historical condition/stage for a resource? I think I haven't seen that option before.</p>

<p>If the server supports it, you can retrieve the history of <em>any</em> resource.  Details are in the spec here: <a href="https://build.fhir.org/http#history">https://build.fhir.org/http#history</a></p>

<p>Thanks Lloyd! Will take a look at that</p>
