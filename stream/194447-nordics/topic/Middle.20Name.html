<p>Stumbled upon this and thought I’d add the plan for Swedish “middle name” or mellannamn. It is used historically as an “additional” family name, but the use of mellannamn has recently been removed, and those names should now be seen as part of the family name meaning we may just append a mellannamn to the family name. </p>
<p>So it is likely that we don’t include support for mellannamn in the Swedish core patient profile. </p>
<p>We do plan to use the extension mentioned above though (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/extension-iso21090-en-qualifier.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/extension-iso21090-en-qualifier.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/extension-iso21090-en-qualifier.html</a>) for pointing out the “preferred” given name using code CL.</p>

<p>During the nordic meeting here in June it was mentioned that this change in national name standards are not yet reflected in the regional infrastructure, so although middle name might not be officially in use anymore, it could be useful to provide the reasoning around this in the profile, possibly even offering guidance on how to map "old" middle names to the profile.</p>

<p>Have looked into this a bit more. </p>
<p>From a Swedish perspective, as it stands now, these are the national rules (<a href="https://www4.skatteverket.se/rattsligvagledning/330287.html" target="_blank" title="https://www4.skatteverket.se/rattsligvagledning/330287.html">https://www4.skatteverket.se/rattsligvagledning/330287.html#</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Middle name is <em>not</em> a form of Given name, hence using the name part qualifier like this is <em>not</em> correct as the middle name here is a given name:</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;given value="Östlund"&gt;<br>
    &lt;extension url="<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-EN-qualifier" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-EN-qualifier">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-EN-qualifier</a>" &gt;<br>
      &lt;valueCoding&gt;<br>
         &lt;code value="MID" /&gt;<br>
         &lt;system value="<a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-EntityNamePartQualifierR2" target="_blank" title="http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-EntityNamePartQualifierR2">http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-EntityNamePartQualifierR2</a>" /&gt;<br>
      &lt;/valueCoding&gt;<br>
    &lt;/extension&gt;<br>
  &lt;/given&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>Middle name is a form of last name/family name</li>
<li>It is no longer possible to acquire a middle name (e.g. Andersson), but people can choose to keep an old middle name (e.g. Andersson) as an explicit middle name, or either 1) append it to the family name (e.g. Svensson), giving *one *family name consisting of two names (family name=Andersson Svensson) or 2) replace the previous family name (family name=Andersson).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Requirements from a Swedish perspective</strong><br>
Even though middle names can no longer be acquired, they still need to be supported for people who have old ones. Hence, we need to support explicit middle names, and they cannot be a given name. This needs to be done using an extension as family name is 0..1 (if family name was 0..* we could have used the name qualifier extension).</p>
<p>What have other Nordic countries done?</p>
<ul>
<li>Norway have created their own extension for middle name, <a href="http://hl7.no/fhir/StructureDefinition/no-basis-middlename" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.no/fhir/StructureDefinition/no-basis-middlename">http://hl7.no/fhir/StructureDefinition/no-basis-middlename</a></li>
<li>Finland?</li>
<li>Denmark?</li>
<li>Iceland?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I think should be done</strong><br>
There should be a new standard extension for Middle Name when used in the context as a family name like in the Scandinavian countries. It can then be used by all countries with this use case. </p>
<p>The existing extension <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-EN-qualifier" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-EN-qualifier">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-EN-qualifier</a> does not support middle name as used in Scandinavia, despite the following code and definition. It would work if it was possible to have multiple Family names, so you can put a MID qualifier on one of them. But I would say it's directly incorrect to use MID on a given name for the Scandinavian/Nordic use case as it is described in the code definition below.</p>
<p>"MID    Middle Name Indicates that the name part is a middle name. In general, the English "middle name" concept is all of the given names after the first. This qualifier may be used to explicitly indicate which given names are considered to be middle names. The middle name qualifier may also be used with family names. This is a Scandinavian use case, matching the concept of "mellomnavn"/"mellannamn".

<p>"In some cultures (e.g. German, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese), family names are complex and composed of various parts that may need to be managed separately, e.g. they have differing significance for searching. In these cases, the full family name is populated in family, and a decomposition of the name can be provided using the family extensions own-name, own-prefix, partner-name, partner-prefix, fathers-family and mothers-family."</p>

We have the same situation in Norway. In the Norwegian naming law middle name is defined as a separate name type that makes the use of the naming qualifier unprecise. The naming law in Norway states that any family name can be a middle name. (Given names cannot). I guess this is a technical issue more than an actual obstacle, but in my mind the middle name is a separate entity in the naming law and should also be a separate entity in the information model, hence the separate norwegian extension for middlename as a part of the no-basis-HumanName, i still feel this is the most correct approach to define specific entities defined by national law. I would wery much appreciate further feedback regarding this reasoning.<br>

<p>You might want to duplicate the extension <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197234">@Martin Grundberg</span> because I have restricted it in documentation to scope middlename in accordance to the Norwegian legislation (Navneloven). "The basis extension defines the Norwegian middlename wich is called "mellomnavn" and defined by Norwegian legislation (Lov om personnavn)." You probably want some other definition in Sweden :-) We could however change the extension to be more general and maybe work in the Nordics instead of only be made for Norway. Feel free to suggest changes to the profile to make it apropriate for use in Norway/Sweden/Denmark.</p>

<p>Our understanding is that middle name only goes into the extension and in humanName.text if that's deemed necessary by the use case. humanName.family SHOULD NOT contain the middle name since the Scandinavian countries' naming laws specifically differentiate between the family name and the middle name.</p>

<p>If there is vital information about the patient that is only available in an extension there is a risk that the patient can potentially be harmed. From my point of view, the patients name is vital information and it is our responsibility to do all we can to ensure that it’s always available and as complete as possible. <br>
When doing a quick search for “wrong patient similar names” in Sweden I get a number of newspaper articles, for example:<br>
<a href="https://www.expressen.se/kvallsposten/patient-fick-fel-blod-hade-liknande-namn/" target="_blank" title="https://www.expressen.se/kvallsposten/patient-fick-fel-blod-hade-liknande-namn/">https://www.expressen.se/kvallsposten/patient-fick-fel-blod-hade-liknande-namn/</a> <br>
<a href="https://www.dagensmedicin.se/artiklar/2016/07/27/sjukhus-sovde-fel-patient/" target="_blank" title="https://www.dagensmedicin.se/artiklar/2016/07/27/sjukhus-sovde-fel-patient/">https://www.dagensmedicin.se/artiklar/2016/07/27/sjukhus-sovde-fel-patient/</a><br>
We know that there will be scenarios when systems that conform with the national Patient-profile communicate with other systems that do not conform to the national profile. Therefore, we need to take into account that there will be systems that only handle HumanName.given and HumanName.family and not the middle-name-extension. We need to ensure that those systems also have as complete information about the patient’s name as possible.<br>
From my point of view, we must provide the Swedish middle name in HumanName.family as well as in the nordic-middle-name-extension.</p>

<p>I am with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191756">@Viktor Jernelöv</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192856">@Thomas Tveit Rosenlund</span>  on this one. </p>
<p>First of all, I think its should be a fundamental principle to not change the meaning of information communicated between systems, hence the middle name should not <em>also</em> be added to to familyName for the simple reason that it is not a part of the family name (like Viktor said, no oranges in the apple basket). I dont know the details of naming in the other Nordic countries, but at least my assessment is that appending the middle name to the family name is against Swedish legal recommendations (<a href="https://www4.skatteverket.se/rattsligvagledning/330287.html" target="_blank" title="https://www4.skatteverket.se/rattsligvagledning/330287.html">https://www4.skatteverket.se/rattsligvagledning/330287.html</a>).</p>
<p>There are potential problems when the middleName extension is not handled by a system. If that is the case, having added it to the familyName means that the family name is incorrect and there is no way to find what is a middle name or a family name, and hence I would argue it cannot be accepted, meaning there is a risk of loosing the whole patient resource instead of just the middle name. From my point of view (an EHR vendors point of view), we would not accept a risk of saving incorrect data.</p>
<p>When it comes to the process of identifying a patient, a few things can be said about that:<br>
1) how to identify patients is a business decision based on the available information in the hospitals system and the interaction with the patient, it doesnt really have anything to do with how you profile the patient resource<br>
2) patient name is probably not a good way of identifying patients anyway, and the primary method for the business should be a patient identifier. As an example, different patients may have the same or similar names. There is a reason why scanning patient wristbands and id cards is the preferred identification method. </p>
<p>Extensions is a core part of FHIR, and we cannot introduce workarounds for all extensions like this and while doing so complicating life for producers and consumers of the information.</p>

<p>I am with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197234">@Martin Grundberg</span> on the point that a person name should not be the main identifier of a Patient receving care in most situations we will use an actual Identifier.</p>
<p>Furthermore I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191756">@Viktor Jernelöv</span> has an excellent point conserning the HumanName.text element. This could be used as a method to assure clients whitch do not conform to the no/se/dk HumanName profiles to still be able to see the full name of a Patient. A Norwegian argonaut IG (for example) could choose to add must-support and even a cardinality of 1..1 to the HumanName.text element to the profile.</p>

<p>I think that the last point from Thomas hasn't been considered enough in this thread - you can indeed make whatever rules you like internally, but it's the flow of information into consumer devices running international specifications that you have to consider carefully, since you have less control there. Consider this:</p>
<ul>
<li>you make the rule that middle name is <em>always</em> in the family name as well</li>
<li>any scandinavian software knows that a middle name in the extension is removed from the family name </li>
<li>other software just uses the family name</li>
<li>this assumes that the middle name isn't independently duplicated in the family name (is that valid?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively:</p>
<ul>
<li>you make the rule that middle name is <em>never</em> in the family name as well</li>
<li>all scandinavian software finds the middle name extension</li>
<li>other software just ignores the middle name</li>
</ul>
<p>The first feels inherently safer to me, but there's a proviso - maybe it's the tail wagging the dog, and losing the middle name in consumer software wouldn't matter? But this leads me to a follow up question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there any published research about what people do with their middle names when setting up apple/google accounts etc?</li>
</ul>
<p>One final comment: I think that if the international patient access spec doesn't make using HumanName.text must-support, then nothing is achieved by making it so in a scandinavian interpretation of that.</p>

<li>the middle name is not a part of the family name, hence you are representing patient names in a way that is in conflict with national naming conventions</li>
<li>Consumers that cant handle the extension has no way of figuring out if the family name is correct or not, which at least means it cannot be used for persisting the name in that application as you risk incorrectly changing the patients name that is in conflict with the master patient index.</li>
<li>Business logic is forced on all producers and consumers to append/remove the middle name from the family name. What if a producer is not aware of this intended business logic (it will not be obvious as it is in conflict with naming conventions)? </li>
</ul>
<p>I also see a risk of having this type of discussion for all extensions. That information is always at risk of being lost for a consumer that doesnt handle it, does that mean we should append that information also to some other standard element to be safe? And couldnt you have the same discussion about any non-extension element, what if it is not supported and removed from a profile, should that also be appended elsewhere?</p>
<p>It is true though that most people (in Sweden at least) will use their middle name together with their family name. And many would likely be confused to hear their name without the middle name. But keeping to the intended use of the resource elements and following national rules, as well as agreeing methods of integration between consumer and producer I would probably see as the safest path forward.</p>

<p>I would argue there is no inconsistency if you look at it a more closely. The Swedish (not sure about Norway or Denmark) Master Data source (MPIs) strictly seperate the middle name from the given name and the family name. Our job lies in achieving interoperability between systems, and to do that we need to maintain the semantic structures as far as possible. We don't want to remove the possibility for systems to  distinguish between the different name parts and also at the same time make sure they don't confuse the name parts with each other.</p>
<p>This is not a controversial thing.</p>
<p>The fact that human beings are confused while hearing their name with a part excluded or not is a different question. The standard is (hopefully?) meant to achieve system &lt;-&gt; system interoperability and not focus on system -&gt; human interoperability if that makes sense?  That comes in a later stage and is handled by how the systems implement their business supporting features and how the people using the systems act.</p>

<p>This raises the question about what a "national basic profile" is and how it should relate to other profiles of different sorts. The idea that I personally have, and that I know at least SOME people (to use Fox News rhetorics) share, is that the national basic profiles are predefined building blocks to represent solutions to profiling problems/needs that most consumers and producers in a specific FHIR context are going to have to solve. This could be for instance: <br>
*how do I represent a national specific address <br>
*how do I make sure my data is tagged with the country specific metadata needed to ensure the various laws can be upheld<br>
*how do I represent the different official identifiers used in our country<br>
*etc</p>
<p>These profiles and extensions could then be used and extended by consumers that have a use case within the same "affinity domain".  In the case with the middleName we simply state that "in the Nordic countries it's important to distinguish between the different parts of a person's name, and this is how you do it". If you are involved in a use case where this is NOT deemed important or meaningful, then by all means, use another profile that supports your use case!</p>
<p>If we try too hard to align all markets/communities to doing the exact same thing or representing the information in the exact same way you're removing one of the most vital cornerstone of the whole standard, clearly explained in <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility.html</a> .</p>
<p>If that's the ambition we have, maybe we're better off trying to standardise at the point of data creation and persistation (basically solving the interoperability problem the openEHR way) and not try to do it at a later stage in the data lifecycle when it's already been created and represented in a system?</p>
<p>Am I completely off track here? In that case, please enlighten me.</p>

<p>As we should, but I'm questioning whether or not we should be concerned by that in the national profiling initiatives or if we simply should treat that as a different use case which needs a new set of profiling work. The latter seems much "cleaner" to me and in a way supports a "separation of concerns" approach to the problem area.</p>

<p>but based on both public and private feedback, I think that populating HumanName.text has legs, and so both my earlier alternatives are less good than:</p>
<ul>
<li>you make the rule that middle name is never in the family name as well</li>
<li>all scandinavian software finds the middle name extension</li>
<li>other software just ignores the middle name, but since it uses the HumanName.text, that doesn't matter </li>
</ul>
<p>That does have the consequence that middle names are not really editable by non-scandinavian aware software, but I think that would be a very low or non-existent disadvantange</p>

<p>With those (I believe somewhat closing remarks) it seems evident to me (at least) that we use the same extension across the nordics for the middle name component in order to at least give vendors and communities outside the nordics a chance to achieve interoperability. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> The FHIR spec contains standardized extensions.

<p>There are still some scenarios that aren’t covered by the last suggested solution to only use the extension for communicating the middle name. One scenario is that there may be software that doesn’t use HumanName.text but uses a combination of HumanName.given and HumanName.family instead. A consequence is then that they will not get the middle name at all. As HumanName.text has cardinality 0…1 in the FHIR spec, that is something I think you must consider.<br>
When making national profiles, I argue that it should be a strong recommendation that the name should always be as complete as possible in all scenarios. The reason for that is that the patients name is used for ensuring the identity of the patient (often together with an identifier, but sometimes on its own.)<br>
I the Swedish group there has been discussions about whether it is our responsibility or not. From my point of view, it is absolutely the responsibly of the makers of national profiles to consider the interoperability in an international context (and in the national context as well, as there will be profiles that are not based on the national profiles) and to do all you can to ensure that vital data isn’t lost in the communication.<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>   Do you know how other similar scenarios have been handled in other national profiles? Do you know if there are any recommendations about how you should handle HumanName.given and HumanName.family? It is not a desired behaviour of an API that new data could “pop up” in HumanName.text that you cannot find in any of the other two fields. It is quite easy to imagine a scenario where a system that does not support the nordic profile has got the complete name in HumanName.text and is forced to prop the data into a model where only two attributes are available in the form of a field for given name and another field for family name. How should they then know what to do with the middle name?<br>
In Sweden, the situation regarding middle name is that you weren’t allowed to have two family names. If you wanted another family name (for example if you wanted to keep our own family name and also take your spouse’s family name) you had to take that new family name as a middle name. Today the rules have changed, you can now have two family names and it is no longer allowed to take new middle names. The persons who have middle names can change them into a family name and then have two family names instead. Therefore, in Sweden, the middle name could be regarded as a kind of family name.</p>

<p>Danish law is a bit different. You MUST have a single family name. There aren't any limits on either the amount of given names or the amount of middle names (though middle names tend to be like a family name). For identification in the healthcare sector, you are always asked for your full name and your civil registration number in order to ensure the identity. As such, the name is not used as a single factor in identifying the individual. It is the combination of name and registration number. Omitting eg. one of the given names and eg. a middle name in the bearing information is therefore not 'dangerous'</p>
