<p>Thank you @Mikael, straight to action as usual :-)<br>
To be clear: the legislation is the proposal by the Dutch cabinet that is being sent to Parliament. We're in a special situation, as in March we had general elections, and we don't have a new Cabinet yet (but we do have a new Parliament). So, now it's up to Parliament to decide whether they want to discuss this proposal with the old (current, demissionary) Cambinet, or wait until the new Cabinet is installed. Since the process to form the new cabinet is getting entangled in its own political web, that may take a while. So, I don't forsee this new law to be discussed and approved in Parliament anytime soon. </p>
<p>Having said that, it maight be more interesting to discuss possible alignment with the MedMij framework, of which there are far better qualified people on this platform than myself.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="216844">@Herko Coomans</span>!</p>
<p>Just to clarify, I didn't expect us to sign a binding deal between the countries in this meeting. :)</p>
<p>In Finland the legislation including API access for citizens to their health data through apps is being passed right now. And the implementation of the API's is already being discussed. Also other Nordic countries are not that far yet. However, I would greatly appreciate it if we could establish some kind of a roadmap for harmonization early on. The threat I see is that without any such plans Finland ends up doing what best suits Finland, which may then very likely be incompatible with implementations of other countries later on.</p>

<p>We’d love to compare approaches and challenges, to see where possible opportunities are! As we (NL) are also the eHealth Network member state co-chair, we might be able to link it to EU collaboration as well.</p>

<p>I would propose to send a statement advocating the approach where the patient can be the courier of their own health data, mentioning HL7 IPA as an example of how that could/should be implemented.</p>
