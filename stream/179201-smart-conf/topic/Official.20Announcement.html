<li>Evaluate the existing SMART on FHIR community based developer tools (SDKs, tutorials and documentation, sandboxes, data creation and manipulation tools, testing frameworks, and app galleries).</li>
<li>Hear from successful App Developers with panels such as: Lessons learned from getting a SMART on FHIR App into production.</li>
<li>Discover the business side of getting apps into production (validation, contracts, etc.).</li>
<li>Network with other Health IT application and platform developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Registration is <strong>$199/attendee</strong> for the full conference. Register now as space is limited. <a href="http://developers.hspconsortium.org/events" target="_blank" title="http://developers.hspconsortium.org/events">http://developers.hspconsortium.org/events</a></p>
