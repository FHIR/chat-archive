<p>Current suggestions for conference location are: Intermountain, Boston Kids. It would be nice for the location to be associated with a health system. Perhaps Hackensack University would be interested? There's a handful of university+medical center app incubators/accelerators. This could make a lot of sense as well. </p>

<p>Wanted to update everyone of the date and location of the conference: It will take place on October 26-27th at Hackensack University Medical Center (HUMC) in New Jersey. Be sure to put a hold on your calendars. </p>
