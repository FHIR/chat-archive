<p>This morning, we talked over the targeted audience for this proposed conference suggested that the primary audience should be non-expert application developers.  This group further divides into entrepreneurial / startup-type developers and dev shops (IT or academic) associated with healthsystems. This potential audience is both much larger and we can have a greater impact through outreach to this group.</p>
