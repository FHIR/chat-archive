<p>Hi,<br>
I have been in discussions with FHIR guys of how the patch functionality should work. I created the following bugs after those: <a href="https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/2897">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/2897</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/2918">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/2918</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/2919">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/2919</a>.<br>
The links to the discussions are also attached to the bugs.<br>
Could you confirm those are the issues? <br>
Or at least maybe you could look at the last one, since it seems to be most critical, since I couldn't find any workarounds about it. (the first two could work with workarounds to use insert and timeDateTime name).</p>
