<p>I was wondering if James or anyone would object to some PRs that "tone down" the DAO logging: it's super chatty, and a whole bunch of different things are included at the same category and level, which makes it difficult to filter.<br>
Specifically, I was thinking of adjusting it so that the "... transaction completed in XXms" events were INFO, and everything else was at DEBUG or TRACE.</p>
