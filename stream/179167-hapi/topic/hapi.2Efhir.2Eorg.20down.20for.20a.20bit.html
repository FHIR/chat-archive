<p>Hi All - FYI <a href="http://hapi.fhir.org">hapi.fhir.org</a> is offline for a bit. I just changed its sizing in order to avoid the regular crashes it's had recently (it keeps running out of RAM due to heavy load) and it lost its IP assignment.</p>
<p>Should be back soon - Just waiting on DNS to get updated.</p>

<p>Update: This server is now back up, and has been allocated a bunch more RAM. I'm hoping this will resolve the instability we saw over the last few months.</p>
<p>If anyone is curious about the root cause: <a href="http://hapi.fhir.org">hapi.fhir.org</a> was running on a server with just under 4 GB of RAM, and occasionally we'd get enough huge parallel requests that it would throw an OutOfMemoryException. The Postgresql JDBC driver has a longstanding bug where it becomes unusable if an OOMException is thrown while it's working under certain conditions. That server was really good at triggering that bug.</p>
