<p>Hello,<br>
I have developed some custom profiles and have written corresponding java classes which I added to HAPI. I imitated the style of the Java classes of the official profiles. I managed to add instances of my custom profiles to my cli-server and can retrieve them when I make a programatic search to all instances of my profile class. However, when restrict the search with constrains with a "where"-part I do not get any results. Could somebody give me an advice how to analyse my problem ? I would like to put some breakpoints in the running server to observe the querying process. Where could I start best with inserting some breakpoints ?<br>
Greetings</p>

<p>Another problem I just encountered is that nested structures/classes inside my custom profiles are somehow not stored. When I read an instance of my custom profile from the .json file and inspect the runtime object in the debugger, the fields for the nested structures are filled. When I store the instance in the server via "MethodOutcome execute = client.create().resource(res).execute();" the instance is stored, but in the resource instance contained in the returned MethodOutcome the nested structures are null. What do I have to check ? The nested class is static and derived from BackboneElement, it has a fully functioning copy method, an empty constructor, it is annotated with "Block". The custom profile class has a public field of the type of the nested class, which is annotated with "child" with all necessary annotations-fields. The primitive fields of my custom profile resource work as expected and are contained in the returned object. Only the nested custom classes are missing.</p>

<p>ah, the null values were a result of missing isEmpty methods of the nested classes. Now the fields are correctly filled.</p>

<p>hm, one thing I did not imitate from the official profiles are the methods "listChildren", "getNamedProperty", "getProperty", "setProperty", "makeProperty", "getTypesForProperty", "addChild". Are they a vital part of the search process ? How are the _hash values generated that are used within some of these methods ? Are those simply hashes of the Strings of the corresponding field-names ?</p>
