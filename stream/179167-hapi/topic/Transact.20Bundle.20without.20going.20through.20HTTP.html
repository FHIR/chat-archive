<p>If I'm inside a HAPI FHIR server is there anyway that I can get a Bundle with TRANSACTION BundleType transacted without going through HTTP/REST? My problem is that I have received a bundle over some other messaging channel and I now want to transact it. Right now I'm doing this by calling myself so to speak:</p>
<p>client.transaction().withBundle(bundle).execute();</p>
<p>This however is causing issues with the security layers on our platform. I have looked at the TransactionProcessor class inside the HAPI server, but this seems very much tied to the transaction happening due to an HTTP request.</p>
