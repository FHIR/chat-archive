<p>We've implemented R4 using java and the hapi fhir server. We're using custom operations and we've noticed that at random times, a url that has always worked and with no updates to the code, will sometimes return a<br>
{"resourceType":"OperationOutcome","issue":[{"severity":"error","code":"processing","diagnostics":"Resource is not known"}]}<br>
error. But if you just continue to call the same endpoint, it eventually realizes that its there. We've seen it more during load testing.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever ran into this problem?</p>
