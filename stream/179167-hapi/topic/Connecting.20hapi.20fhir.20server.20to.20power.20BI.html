<p>Hi peers,<br>
I am new with FHIR and tring to play and learn with a developed severe with hapi. I seek to make the data seems for folks like me,  who are not that much into IT,  more understandable and user friendly. I mean client like mode to have simple query etc on entries. I was thinking about Power BI, postman etc. Especially, I am interested to know how power bi can get connected to hapi fhir server.</p>

<p>Hi Abraham, </p>
<p>The latest version (2.78.5740.721) of <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/" target="_blank" title="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/">Power BI Desktop</a> includes a FHIR server connector for native access to FHIR servers (docs <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/connectors/fhir/fhir" target="_blank" title="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/connectors/fhir/fhir">here</a>). </p>
<p>It has some pretty neat features around query folding and expanding (to inline hierarchical data).  Seeing this made me realize that the announcement never happened, since it was bundled in the HIMSS announcements. </p>
<p>Thanks for the prod, I'll try to find the official announcement to post on Zulip!</p>
