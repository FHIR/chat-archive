<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>A few quick updates on what's going on at the HAPI FHIR project these days:</p>
<p>We have merged the HAPI 3 branch into master. This means a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for FHIR R4 (current draft) has now been integrated into the codebase</li>
<li>We had previously been targeting calling the next version of HAPI FHIR version 2.6, but it will now be called 3.0.0</li>
<li>If you have any code targetting version "2.6-SNAPSHOT", you should consider upgrading it to support "3.0.0-SNAPSHOT" instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that 3.0.0 will be an API breaking change release. We have dropped support for FHIR DSTU1 and removed a bunch of legacy code, most notably the old Atom-based Bundle class and related methods on the parser and client.</p>
<p>There has been some reorganization of the library as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>The FHIR client code has moved out of hapi-fhir-base and into a new library called hapi-fhir-client (which you will need to manually add to your project if you are building clients)</li>
<li>The FHIR server code has moved out of hapi-fhir-base and into a new library called hapi-fhir-server (which you will need to manually add to your project if you are building servers)</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also moved a few classes into new packages. If you have code which suddenly starts complaining of missing classes when you upgrade to HAPI 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT, you should make sure that you have included the appropriate client or server JAR, and you should use your IDE's "organize imports" function to re-import various HAPI classes that may have moved.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why we are making these big annoying changes, moving things around: The deal is that HAPI has grown significantly in the last few years. When we started the project it was a simple parser and server project, but we are now contending with trying to support client apps, SMART apps, OSGi containers, Android development platforms, and various server platforms, all from a single code base.</p>
<p>The previous arrangement meant that (for example) Android users had to include a server framework in their apps even thought they would never use it, OSGi users had to use a special massive build with every single dependency included, etc. Our new arrangement modularizes the code base in order to make this easier.</p>
<p>Please feel free to reply to this email if you encounter issues when upgrading. I expect there will be pains we hadn't considered yet..</p>
<p>On another note, our public test server has been upgraded to include initial R4 support. The test endpoint is here:</p>
<p><a href="http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseR4" target="_blank" title="http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseR4">http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseR4</a></p>
<p>On one final note, I should probably mention that I'm not as up to date on Zulip as I wish I was. Unfortunately the volume of requests coming in seems to be constantly keeping me underwater these days. If you have questions here that you can't find a resolution on, consider posting on the HAPI FHIR Google Group. There is a very active community there as well.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
James</p>

<p>I upgraded my hapi fhir to dstu3 3.0.0 but LocationPhysicalType which was part of "org.hl7.fhir.dstu3.model.codesystems". But got an error could not find LocationPhysicalType enum. I couldnot find it in hapi-fhir-structures-dstu3-3.0.0. Could you please advise ? Also, upgrading to r4, i got a error saying that "could not find any HAPI-FHIR structure JARs on the classpath" error.</p>
