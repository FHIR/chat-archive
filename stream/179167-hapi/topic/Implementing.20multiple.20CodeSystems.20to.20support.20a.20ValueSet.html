<p>I’m looking to support the US Core Condition Code ValueSet (<a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet-us-core-condition-code.html">https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet-us-core-condition-code.html</a>) on a UI I’m developing. We are trying to figure out how to meet the criteria of providing the end user with searchable access to both SNOMED and ICD9 and ICD10. I believe we have a handle on getting SNOMED into our FHIR server, however the additional requirement to support ICD9 and ICD10 has us spinning a bit. Has anyone added ICD9 and ICD10 as a CodeSystem to their FHIR server? Ideally we’re looking to build one field where the user can enter text or a code number and it returns a subset of results to choose from. Are we on the bleeding edge, or has someone implemented something like this successfully and can help guide our way? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>suggest that you ask on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179202" href="/#narrow/stream/179202-terminology">#terminology</a> where the ICD experts (a relative term) hang out</p>
