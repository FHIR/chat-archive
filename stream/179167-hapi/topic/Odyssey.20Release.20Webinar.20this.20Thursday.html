<p>Hi All,<br>
The HAPI FHIR 5.3.0 release webinar will be this Thursday, February 18 at 10:00am Eastern (Toronto) time. </p>
<p>The codename for this release is Odyssey. This is a big one, quite a few great new features have made it in (enough that I'm stressing a bit about how we're going to fit it all into 30 mins! :) )</p>
<p>Details on where to find the webinar can be found here: <a href="https://www.smilecdr.com/quarterly-product-release-webinar-reminder">https://www.smilecdr.com/quarterly-product-release-webinar-reminder</a></p>
<p>As always, we'll be posting a link to the recording shortly afterward so don't worry if this time doesn't work for you.</p>
<p>Cheers,James</p>
