<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>A number of people have noted that the POM for HAPI FHIR 4.0.0 contained a dependency on one SNAPSHOT POM version, which prevented successful upgrades to HAPI FHIR 4.0.0 for some users (Gradle users in particular).</p>
<p>This was our first attempt at a simultaneous hapi-fhir and org.hl7.fhir.core release and I guess we still need to perfect the process. Our apologies to anyone who was inconvenienced by this!</p>
<p>A new version of HAPI FHIR (4.0.1) has now been pushed to Maven Central. This release contains no new/updated functionality, it simply corrects the snapshot dependency. As such, there is no need to upgrade if you are already successfully using the new version of HAPI FHIR (but you might want to anyhow since snapshot dependencies can eventually cause unexpected issues).</p>
<p>While I have everyone, I'll also give a quick reminder of the 2019 Community Survey. Thanks to everyone who has filled it out so far. If you haven't, please consider doing so now so that you can help shape the next year of HAPI FHIR development!</p>
