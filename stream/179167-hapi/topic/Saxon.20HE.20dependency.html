<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We recently started auditing our project's transitive dependencies and found that Saxon HE is being brought in via HAPI FHIR.</p>
<p>Looking through HAPI FHIR's usages of Saxon, the only thing I can find is an unused import: <a href="https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/blob/master/hapi-fhir-base/src/main/java/ca/uhn/fhir/validation/IValidatorModule.java#L3">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/blob/master/hapi-fhir-base/src/main/java/ca/uhn/fhir/validation/IValidatorModule.java#L3</a></p>
<p>It seems like there was an issue and associated PR to remove Saxon back in 2016 (<a href="https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/440">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/440</a>), but this import was added to IValidatorModule more recently, so I'm wondering if it was added back erroneously or something?</p>
<p>It also seems like at least one todo calls out that Saxon is not needed: <a href="https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/blob/master/hapi-fhir-structures-dstu3/todo.txt">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/blob/master/hapi-fhir-structures-dstu3/todo.txt</a></p>
<p>Let me know if this dependency is actually needed and I'm off-base here. Thanks!</p>
