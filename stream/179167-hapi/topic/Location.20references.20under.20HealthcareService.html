<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>Regarding HealthcareService objects (org.hl7.fhir.r4.model.HealthcareService), in order to represent its coverage area, currently we are defining a Location object (org.hl7.fhir.r4.model.Location) which has associated an Extension object (org.hl7.fhir.r4.model.Extension) which, in turn contains all the coverage area information under an Attachment object (org.hl7.fhir.r4.model.Attachment). </p>
<p>Once the Location object representing the coverage area is added to the HealthcareService object via the addLocation() method, in addition to the Location entry created in the JSON file bundle ("resourceType": "Bundle") with all the coverage area relevant information (totally expected), a Location reference is created under the HealthcareService&gt;Location element (not desirable according to our expectations).  </p>
<p>Our question is: </p>
<p>Is there a way to add a Location object to a HealthcareService object and avoid including the HealthcareService&gt;entry&gt;location reference to the newly added Location object in the generated JSON file?</p>
<p>Our HAPI FHIR version is 5.4.0.</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>Undesirable HealthcareService &gt; entry &gt; location:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>    &quot;location&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;&lt;some valid reference to the HealthcareService location&gt;&quot;,
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Location&quot;,
        &quot;display&quot;: &quot;ABC&quot;
      },
      {
        &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;&lt;Undesirable reference to the coverage area Location object&gt;&quot;
      }
    ],
</code></pre></div>

<p>Thanks and regards,</p>
<p>Juan Ospina</p>
