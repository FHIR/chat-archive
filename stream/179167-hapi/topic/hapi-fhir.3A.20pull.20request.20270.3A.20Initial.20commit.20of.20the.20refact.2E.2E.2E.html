<p>Hi Bill- I see where you're going with this. I'm not totally clear on why it's needed/how it will be used though. Is the idea that you want to have your own implementations of the DAOs that don't use hibernate than then plug those into the resource providers? If so, why do they need to be in their own JAR for that to happen? Couldn't you just create a custom spring configuration that uses the RPs but wires them to a different implementation of the DAO interfaces?</p>
<p>Or am I misunderstanding the motivation?</p>
<p>One other thing to note- this pull request doesn't actually merge cleanly (you can see the <code>This branch has conflicts</code> message below that indicates this). It needs to merge in order for the CI server to build it and the test coverage tools to test it. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/" target="_blank" title="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/">here</a> are some details on how to fix this... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The METADATA.MF file is there so the project can be managed as a Plugin Project in Eclipse. This makes resolving package imports so much easier. I only put version numbers on the imports when it is actually needed. In OSGi, specifying version=”x.y.z” is just saying what the minimum version needs to be.. not the specific version. For instance, in hapi-fhir-base, the imports of org.apache.http.* specify version=”4.0” because the code references methods that were introduced in v4.0.</p>
<p>One thing I really don’t care for in the Maven bundle plugin is that it wants to put a version on every import and this is usually the latest version of things. The problem with this is it makes it really hard to install the bundle in an existing OSGi container that might not have that exact version in place. For things that are pretty generic like commons-io or commons-lang3, the version is not really useful. For things like javax.servlet, it can actually make it impossible to deploy if the version does not match the version of the underlying platform.</p>
<p>Like I said, I only use the versions when code references something that was not part of the base version of a package. Also, I pretty much never use “bracketing” version specifications (version=”(1.0,2.0]” which means version=1.x.x) since nearly everything has pretty good downward compatibility (v2.x will usually be compatible with code written for v1.x).</p>

Provider and DAO layers (#270)</p>
<p>Hi Bill- I see where you're going with this. I'm not totally clear on why<br>
it's needed/how it will be used though. Is the idea that you want to have<br>
your own implementations of the DAOs that don't use hibernate than then<br>
plug those into the resource providers? If so, why do they need to be in<br>
their own JAR for that to happen? Couldn't you just create a custom spring<br>
configuration that uses the RPs but wires them to a different<br>
implementation of the DAO interfaces?</p>
<p>Or am I misunderstanding the motivation?</p>
<p>One other thing to note- this pull request doesn't actually merge cleanly<br>
(you can see the This branch has conflicts message below that indicates<br>
this). It needs to merge in order for the CI server to build it and the<br>
test coverage tools to test it. here&lt;<br>

to fix this...</p>

<p>Yes, I found that out when I finally got the merge to master finished… also need to add hapi-fhir-providers</p>
<p>Not sure it is needed but I also added them to SITE &lt;profile&gt;</p>

<p>Hmm no, unfortunately I have no idea why that would be happening.</p>
<p>I'll try to check it out and run it myself at some point soon and see if I<br>
see anything obvious.</p>
<p>I think you need to add the new dao-base project to the list of modules in<br>
the ALLMODULES profile in the root pom.xml. The CI server is failing<br>
&lt;<a href="https://travis-ci.org/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/builds/97096585" target="_blank" title="https://travis-ci.org/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/builds/97096585">https://travis-ci.org/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/builds/97096585</a>&gt; but I think<br>
that's just because it's not finding that module.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

<p>Yes, the reason for the split is to be able to implement RPs and DAOs<br>
independently. In the OSGi world, there is good reason to keep them in<br>
separate JARs (bundles). Then you use Spring-DM (Gemini Blueprint) to wire<br>
across bundles via just interfaces.</p>
<p>I saw that message when I made the pull request and I’ll work on the merge<br>
today. It doesn’t look like it will be a big chore.</p>
<p>One other thing, most of the tests in ResourceProviderDstu1Test and<br>
ResourceProviderDstu2Test are failing with<br>
javax.persistence.TransactionRequiredException. However, all of the<br>
FhirResourceDaoXxxx tests succeed… Do you have any ideas why this might<br>
occur? Not having worked a bunch with Hibernate and JPA, I am looking for<br>
thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>Cheers, Bill</p>
