<p>Hello, i wanted to used the NPMPackageValidation as explained in the hapi validation examples. I am wondering, where to find this class or how to include it. I am currently not able to find a reference to this library in the global maven repository.<br>
The validation packages and resources can be included as expected, but the npm is missing.<br>
As it is stated in the javadoc, this is available since Version 5.5.0, but in the maven repository it is 5.4.9 I think this may be the issue. Do you have any hints how to use it right now?</p>
