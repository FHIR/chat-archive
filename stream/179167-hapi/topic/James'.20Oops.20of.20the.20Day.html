<p>So.. thanks to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191321">@David Hay</span> for pointing out that the HAPI server was down.</p>
<p>We just turned on the Bulk Export feature in HAPI FHIR this weekend. The way HAPI's bulk export works is that it generates the export files, and exposes them out to the outside world as Binary resources (since the new binary storage feature already means that Binary is intended to be the best place for big files in HAPI).</p>
<p>This had the hilarious consequence that any export requests for all resource types included all of the export files from previous exports (we keep the binaries around for 24 hours, so they'd be candidates to be added for that long). That "feature" caused the disk to fill up and the server to crash.</p>
<p>Sorry to anyone who was working on our R4 server today. Unfortunately I had to purge it in order to recover. :(</p>

<p>Are you going to load the conformance resources back in?</p>

<p>And a very pleasant side effect is that the StructureDefinintions 'altered' by someone will be replaced with fresh ones!</p>
