<p>Hi all, I am rather new to FHIR and the Hl7 standard, but I recently set up a HAPI FHIR JPA server in AWS fargate (backend connected to RDS) and individually loaded all the necessary US Core Profiles (as structureDefinition(s)) for validation purposes related to my use case. However, I was wondering if there was a easier/faster way to be able to load all US Core Profiles at once, instead of one by one. Would a better route here be to load the US Core IG directly to my server? If so, how would one do this? Any knowledge here would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>P.S. I also saw in this chat someone talking about updating the HAPI FHIR application.yaml in order to validate against the US Core IG here:<br>

<p>Follow the thread you already found. That specifies how you can 'install' multiple IG's (groups of structuredefs and more) in one step.</p>
