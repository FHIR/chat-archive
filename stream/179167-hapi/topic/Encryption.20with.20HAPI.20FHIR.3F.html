<p>We are looking into setting up a FHIR server and the HAPI JPA Server looks very interesting. However, we have a strong requirement on encrypting the data. Has anyone looked into trying to get some kind of encryption layer into the HAPI JPA Server? I had a quick look and just encrypting/decrypting the JSON documents should be ok, but I guess the tricky part is going to be all the index tables... Or do you know of any other FHIR Server that works well with encryption?</p>

<p>No experience with that whatsoever - but it sounds like its going to have a hard impact on your Hibernate usage.</p>
