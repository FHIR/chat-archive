<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We are planning to use HAPI FHIR to store medical records of the patients for organisations. I have specific requirements to build dashboards and reports out of it. i.e. an organization dashboard which displays how many patients visited, how many appointments are issued / fulfilled, what is the appointments trend over a month etc. In order to populate these dashboards I have two options </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Query on Realtime - Query each metric realtime, aggregate and show on the dashboard. In this case, I may have to run multiple asynchronous REST API calls to do the same</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aggregate data in batch mode - In specific schedule time, Query data from through REST APIs, aggregate and store in separate DB, then render the dashboard. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Is there any other optimised way to achieve such requirement? or do we have any libraries can achieve these kinds of requirements. Please provide your inputs.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Kishore</p>

<p>Not yet BUT: Look at Measure and MeasureReport (the latter is what you'd call a report), and then also look at CQL.  These might provide you with a starting point.  There are already tools and measures that can be evaluated.  They may not be the measures you want, but they can give you a pattern to start from.</p>
