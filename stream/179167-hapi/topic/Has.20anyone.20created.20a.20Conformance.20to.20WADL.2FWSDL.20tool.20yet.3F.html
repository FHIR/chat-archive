<p>I've looked online and haven't found anything yet. To work with common tools those are necessary. I'd like to create one but don't want to if it already exists and I just failed to find it.</p>

<p>I don't know of anything for that. There's some names that we use that are not legal WADL names, I think. At least someone told me that was true. I don't see any follow up about that in my email archive though</p>

<p>Alright - thank you for the confirmation. If I find anything or come up with a solution I'll update the list here.</p>
