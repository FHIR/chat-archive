<p>Hey everyone, what I am going to ask might be questioned somewhere above or other streams that I was not able to carve out. We have a Hapi server that I was asked to know how we can import into and export bulk data using external resources such as hard disks. The aim is to have this be done with people with little technical knowledge. So the questions are how this bulk data import should be done? and whether we have a user-friendly client? I am aware of simplifier and SMART projects but would appreciate knowing if we have something other than them or a procedure that can be employed easier.</p>
