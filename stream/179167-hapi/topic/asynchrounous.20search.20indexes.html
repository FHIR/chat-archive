<p>Hi,</p>
<p>From what I can tell, it looks like the search indexing after i.e. creating a new Patient resource is being done asynchronously. If i directly query for my newly created patient based on a ?identifier= it will not find it.<br>
Is this behavior configurable? Is there for instance an option to have the POST request wait with returning until the indexes are updated?</p>

<p>Not currently possible - The assumption is that reindexing is going to take a very long time on real production systems with ream amounts of data, so a blocking query wouldn't really be feasible.</p>

<p>Are there any fields other than the logical <code>id</code> field that are highly consistent when you do a read/search request? I mean fields that are indexes instantly pas part of i.e. an update operation.</p>

<p>for instance the _tag field? or is that also part of the async index update?</p>

<p>consider this example:<br>
if i create a patient resource with a POST /Patient, i get an <code>id</code> back in the response, which i can use to lookup that patient resource from that point on. However, if i search for it by <code>lastname</code>, it will not find it until the re-indexing has completed. </p>
<p>I was wondering if there are any other fields that i can use to request my just-created Patient resource that do not depend on the re-index</p>

<p>or is that limited to the logical <code>id</code> field?</p>

<p>Well, lastname is a built in search parameter so you should be able to use it right away, unless you had previously removed it and performed a reindex, and you are now re-enabling it.</p>
<p>In other words, reindexing doesn't disable existing search parameters, it only adds new ones to the mix once it's complete.</p>

<p>Point stands though- Any search parameter that was there before you added the new one and started the reindex will work during the reindex too. Including <code>_id</code> and <code>family</code></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191319">@James Agnew</span>  but if it's a CREATE action, none of the parameters were there before (for this Resource) right? so that means that after a create action you always have to wait until re-indexing is finished before being able to find it? (this is what I seem to be experiencing)</p>
<p>edit: and by "being able to find it" i mean a search call based on i.e. ?identifier= or ?_tag=  or ?family=</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I still don't understand what you are describing. Perhaps you could describe in more detail the steps you are taking that aren't prodicing the expected results?</p>
<p>My only thought here is maybe you are simply getting hit by the query cache: <a href="https://smilecdr.com/docs/fhir_repository/performance_and_caching.html">https://smilecdr.com/docs/fhir_repository/performance_and_caching.html</a></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191319">@James Agnew</span>  ha indeed! I just came to the same conclusion, and this is indeed the issue i was having.</p>
<p>our application that creates fhir resources based on a patient DB  does a lookup based on _tag to see if there is an existing Resource for that Patient. When processing an update for a just-created patient, it would hit cache when trying to look it up, thus assuming it does not exist yet. Now using no-cache headers for this specific scenario and all is good!</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
