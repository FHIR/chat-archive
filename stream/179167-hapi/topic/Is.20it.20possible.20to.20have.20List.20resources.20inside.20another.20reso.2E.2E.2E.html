<p>Adding to the chat a message we had in fhir community:</p>
<p>In my current FHIR implementation for 834 x12 , I have a requirement while creating my data model that list of a resource should reside inside another resource , but we want that list of resources to not be contained resources as there is a need for that resources to exist independently so that they can be later enquired by direct GET calls .<br>
To give an example , here I am trying to have list of Domain Resource - Coverage inside another resource MHEnrollmentRequest which extends domain resource EnrollmentRequest :</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>@ResourceDef(profile=&quot;http://fhirserver/fhir/StructureDefinition/MHEnrollmentRequest&quot;)
public class MHEnrollmentRequest extends EnrollmentRequest {

  @Child(name = &quot;coverages&quot;)
  @Description(shortDefinition = &quot;X12 uses more than 1 coverage, so we need some extras&quot;)
  private List&lt;Coverage&gt; coverages;
</code></pre></div>
<p>When using IParser’s method encodeResourceToString , it lets me have one coverage in above list of coverages and I can see json printed fine for EnrollmentRequest, but moment second coverage is added to list of coverages , parser starts failing with this error -<br>
Exception in thread “main” java.lang.Error: Encountered IOException during write to string - This should not happen!<br>
at ca.uhn.fhir.parser.BaseParser.encodeResourceToString(BaseParser.java:275)</p>
<p>Is there a way to have list of independent resources inside another resource in FHIR ? Any other suggestion that doesn’t include contained resources will be very useful !</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
