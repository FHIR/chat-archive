<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>As quite a few people have noticed lately, our public demo server ( <a href="http://fhirtest.uhn.ca" target="_blank" title="http://fhirtest.uhn.ca">http://fhirtest.uhn.ca</a> ) has been crashing quite a bit in the last while, and has been quite slow even when it's been up.</p>
<p>I've decided to bit the bullet and move it off of the aging server that has been hosting it for the last 3 years. This server has been having lots of filesystem issues lately, so I think it's time to move off.</p>
<p>So as of now, the server is deployed to AWS (instead of being hosted at UHN) and is now backed by a PostgreSQL 9.4 database instead of Apache Derby. I'm hoping this will go a long way towards improving performance on this server.</p>
<p>This means that all 3 endpoints (DSTU1, DSTU2, STU3) are now empty once again. I'm in the process of uploading the example resources into each, but if you have tests that rely on your own resources being in there you'll need to re-upload that.</p>
<p>I'm going to re-upload Snomed CT and LOINC definition files a bit later today.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
James</p>

<p>Thanks, James :-)  Posted a patient to test, working perfectly.</p>
