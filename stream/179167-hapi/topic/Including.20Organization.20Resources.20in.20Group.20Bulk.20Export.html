<p>I am trying to include Organization resources in Bulk Data Group export. However, if in include it I get <code>Resource type [] is not eligible for this type of export, as it contains no Patient compartment, and no </code>patient<code> or </code>subject<code> search parameter</code>.  But in the fhir spec it says </p>
<p>"However, other resources outside of the patient compartment that are helpful in interpreting the patient data (such as Organization and Practitioner) may also be returned." </p>
<p>and I would like to support this. Is there any way to configure Organization resources to be included, or to manually include some Organization resources in the bulk export?</p>
