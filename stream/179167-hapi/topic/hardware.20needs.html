<p>What is the main thing a HAPI needs when put under pressure with a lot of resources to ingest and to retrieve with parallel threads, CPU or RAM ? In my setup I only want to optimize the HAPI server itself without the database.</p>

<p>FWIW my experience has definitely been that HAPI FHIR is more CPU bound than memory bound. You need to have enough RAM though to ensure that you don't start losing too much CPU to GC cycles.</p>
<p>One thing I've definitely discovered in recent performance and benchmarking work we've been doing is that using a recent JDK makes a surprising amount of difference. If you are in a position to use JDK17 I highly recommend you do so.</p>
