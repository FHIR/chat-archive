<p>I uploaded a transaction Bundle to  <a href="http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4">http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4</a><br>
The response code was 200 but I received no Bundle containing the logical ids assigned to the resources by the server. Instead I received this huge markdown/swagger page with no information about the uploaded resources at all.  What did I do wrong? I used to get a response Bundle with critical info like the assigned logical ids of the resources.</p>
