<p>Hello everyone, <br>
we are trying to bulk delete some resources from our HAPI FHIR server - more specifically Coverage resources. We have around 7 million unique records.<br>
The FHIR server is very slow at deleting them - we have tried multiple solutions. We have implemented every performance recommendation available in the docs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Expunge - handles about 8000 records per a few minutes (very slow)</li>
<li>Expunge delete - similar to 1</li>
<li>We are thinking of updating the records on the database - the res_deleted_at element and expunging the deleted versions - this seems faster<br>
Is there a way to speed up the process or any alternative solution to make the bulk deleting faster?</li>
</ol>
