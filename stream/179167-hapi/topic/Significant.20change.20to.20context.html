<p>I've just committed a potentially significant change to the FHIR core BaseWorkerContext, around how it caches resources. It now is a little more careful to manage the cache correctly, and it's tested (see org.hl7.fhir.r5.test.MetadataResourceManagerTester).</p>
<p>There's on significant functionality change: if you ask for v4.0.0 of a resource (by URL), and the cache doesn't have 4.0.0 but does have 4.0.x it will consider that a match. Also, the cache is more careful to make sure that access just be url makes the most recent version available (could be confused by dropping a resource in the past)</p>
<p>I don't think that this makes any difference to anyone, but alerting people here so that people can weigh in. I can consider removing this - maybe - if it's problematic, but I need to solve the 4.0./4.0.1 problem somehow)</p>
