<p>Is there an easy way to retrieve a binary stream using the HAPI Client?  </p>
<p>My use case is that I am trying to retrieve an attachment that is located on a hosted FHIR server that will only return a stream not a Binary bundle.  I would prefer not to create another client within the project just to retrieve a streamed item (document, image, pdf...).</p>
<p>Also how do you use the binary get resource to retrieve a stream.  When using something like this:<br>
Binary binary = client.read().resource(Binary.class).withUrl(queryString).execute();</p>
<p>I will receive an error for invalid content-type.  Is there a way to set the Binary to only accept a stream and not send the Accept header?</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
