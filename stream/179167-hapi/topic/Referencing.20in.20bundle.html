<p>Sandeep Rathore: Hi Everyone,<br>
I have created a bundle resource from HL7 v2 meassage, in which I am sending full URL for each resource in order to reference it in another resource, i have also used conditional update in few of the resources like - Patient Resource and Encounter resource based on the identifiers. My issue is - In fhir server it it creating 2 resources for a single resource from the bundle. one with the full url  as resource id which is an empty resource and another with its own resourcse id for example - For a patient resource in a bundle- It is creating 2 patient resources on server, one with full content inside it and with new resource id, and another with the full url id that I have given. Please refer the attached fhir bundle.  I am using Hapi JPA server<br>
