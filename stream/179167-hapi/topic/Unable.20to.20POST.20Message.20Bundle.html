<p>Hello,<br>
I am trying to post the bundle to the root where the type is set to message on my HAPI FHIR server. The event code is eventCoding" : {<br>
          "system" : "<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-alerts/CodeSystem/notification-event" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-alerts/CodeSystem/notification-event">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-alerts/CodeSystem/notification-event</a>",<br>
          "code" : "notification-admit",<br>
          "display" : "Notification Admit"<br>
        }, but it returns an error message saying - 'Unable to process transaction where incoming Bundle.type = message'. I tried the $process-message operation, where I used POST with url -http://localhost:8080/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir/$process-message. It returned a message saying -This operation is not yet implemented on this server. If I post it to the url with/Bundle, it does accept that. But my understanding was that this could be done by posting to the root or $process-message operation so that resources could be shredded and persisted individually. Can somebody shed light on this. Thank you.</p>

<p>If a message Bundle is POSTed to /Bundle, it will be archived as-is by the server, without any processing. If you wish to use $process-message, you'll have to implement it (on your own HAPI server) for your specific trigger event type. Some servers, when one posts a message bundle to the root of the server. may accept that bundle and process it as if it were a collection of posts - but the standard doesn't describe / mandate such behavior, and as such most current servers don't support this any more. You really need $process-message to deal with the workflow/business expectations associated with a trigger event.</p>
