<p>Hi everybody. I am fairly new to FHIR and HAPI. I've created some profiles using Forge and now want to use them in a fresh installation of the starter project.</p>
<p>When I try to post a resource of one of these new profiles, HAPI is always telling me "Incorrect resource type found".  I was under the impression that I just have to put the xml structure definitions of the profiles somewhere and it would work. I have already posted the profiles to the StructureDefinition endpoint, but this does not seem to be enough.</p>
<p>Can anybody point me in the right direction? Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>I think I've got it. I still have to post to the endpoint name of the base resource type and just provide the url to the structure definition of the profile in the meta tag. At least this is what seems to work now.</p>
