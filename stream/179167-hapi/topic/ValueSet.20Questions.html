<p>I have uploaded a csv with a custom Code System, I was able to validate a few of the codes to make sure they were correctly implemented.<br>
I have then created a Value Set that includes the system URI and nothing else, just to have a way of returning all the codes and descriptions of the custom code system.<br>
I understand I have to wait 10 minutes for it to be "pre-expanded". But when it does, it saves 0 concepts:<br>
Pre-expanded ValueSet[ValueSet/55/_history/1] with URL[Codes.001] - Saved 0 concepts in 38ms</p>
<p>So, questions:<br>
1- Do I need to do all of this just to get all the codes of a code system?<br>
2- Why is it saving 0 concepts and not all of the custom code system?<br>
({<br>
"resourceType": "ValueSet",<br>
"url": "Codes.001",<br>
"compose" : {<br>
"include" : [{<br>
"system" : "<a href="http://codes">http://codes</a>"<br>
}]<br>
}<br>
}<br>
3- Is there a way to reduce the 10 min wait?<br>
4- Whenever I create a ValueSet, it is created with a random id, like "55". Can I specify an id for it to have? Or do I need to take note of all these ids it creates?</p>
<p>If this is documented anywhere, please point me in that direction, I've been failing to find that info.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
