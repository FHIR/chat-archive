<p>Hello everyone,<br>
I have a question similar to <a href="#narrow/stream/179167-hapi/topic/Subscription.20channel.20type.20'message">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179167-hapi/topic/Subscription.20channel.20type.20'message</a>'<br>
I am attempting to create a Subscription on <a href="http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/">http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/</a> with a channel type 'message'.</p>
<p>I would like to use the message channel type to submit the matched resource to a named broker channel - JMS, Kafka or external event ingestion service - preferably Azure event hubs. </p>
<p>However, the following error is returned:<br>
Only 'channel' protocol is supported for Subscriptions with channel type 'message'</p>
<p>So what is a "channel" scheme? I am attempting to provide an HTTP endpoint.</p>
<p>Looking at the documentation for HAPI, I don't see anything being mentioned for Subscriptions.</p>
<p>Smile CDR's documentation however provides more information about subscriptions.</p>
<p>Regarding the message channel subscriptions, the information is very limited. It looks like Smile CDR has message brokers that can be configured. I was wondering whether this can be achieved in HAPI (open source as well).</p>
<p>Additional question: are the message channel types Subscriptions only limited to Smile CDR?</p>
<p>How can I achieve publishing events to external event ingestion service using HAPI?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
