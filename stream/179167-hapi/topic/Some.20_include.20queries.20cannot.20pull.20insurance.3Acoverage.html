<p>Hi all,<br>
In some cases, _include queries are not pulling the insurance:Coverage from a resource. It works for an instance of DeviceRequest, but not for ServiceRequest or MedicationRequest. We've been running this on a local HAPI server on version 5.4.0.</p>
<p>This example query features a DeviceRequest that tries to get the insurance coverage, and is successful.<br>
<code>http://localhost:8080/test-ehr/r4/DeviceRequest?_include=DeviceRequest:insurance:Coverage</code></p>
<p>This example features a ServiceRequest that tries to get the insurance coverage, but is unsuccessful.<br>
<code>http://localhost:8080/test-ehr/r4/ServiceRequest?_id=servreq-g0180-1&amp;_include=ServiceRequest:insurance:Coverage</code><br>
It successfully pulls other _includes like Patient/Practitioner/etc and the resource in the insurance field is of type Coverage.</p>
<p>The fhir resources for both are in the same structure with similar fields. Any idea why this might be working in some cases but not others? </p>
<p>I also tried the same query to <a href="http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4">http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4</a>:<br>
<code>http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/DeviceRequest?_id=93947&amp;_include=DeviceRequest:patient&amp;_include=DeviceRequest:insurance:Coverage</code><br>
But didn't get back either the Coverage, Patient, or any other _includes even though they're in that 93947 resource.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I looked at <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/servicerequest.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/servicerequest.html</a> and :insurance isn't a known search parameter, so I would say that it's not a known include value either.</p>

<p>Gotcha, thank you!</p>
