<p>This isn't going to be a HAPI-specific question...</p>
<p>I have my HAPI server running locally and I want to deploy it to an AWS Beanstalk installation.  When I do the deploy, I don't get any page.  Checking the logs, I have the following error:<br>
Caused by: org.apache.derby.iapi.error.StandardException: Failed to create database 'directory:target/jpaserver_derby_files', see the next exception for details.<br>
Caused by: org.apache.derby.iapi.error.StandardException: Directory /usr/share/tomcat8/target/jpaserver_derby_files cannot be created.</p>
<p>So I'm trying to figure out how to create that directory in the Beanstalk environment.  Has anyone succesfully deployed a HAPI server to an AWS Beanstalk environment and can you help a brother out?</p>

<p>Figured out my own problem.  Had to fix permissions on the target directory and had to specify the server address properly.  Now I can go about adding my custom operations!</p>

<p>Ah, ok, based on this question I now know you're using JPA server so that answers my other question from the email. :)</p>
<p>The easiest thing then will be to create a plain provider class with an <a href="http://hapifhir.io/doc_rest_operations.html#_toc_extended_operations" target="_blank" title="http://hapifhir.io/doc_rest_operations.html#_toc_extended_operations">operation method</a> on it, and then register that against the RestfulServer instance.</p>
