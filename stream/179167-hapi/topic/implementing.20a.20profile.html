<p>Hello hapi people,</p>
<p>I'm a newbe with FHIR and HAPI.  We have to implement a new profile. I have studied the HAPI docu sofar and now i'm just curious if there is a Java  code generator for a profile? Or if there is no one, where i could find samples for such an impementation with HAPI?</p>
<p>any help is appreciated<br>
regards<br>
Dmitri</p>

<p>we haven't got a code generator for profiles. we've talked about it, but we haven't done it at this stage. If I did a code generator, it would be a facade to the resource, not a sub-class. Note that - it's a mistake to think of a profile as as sub-class. </p>
<p>but more generally, the profile is set of rules that apply to the use of the resource and it's often relevent to be subject to more than one set of rules - so quite often it just turns out that the profile is a set of rules for your code too</p>
