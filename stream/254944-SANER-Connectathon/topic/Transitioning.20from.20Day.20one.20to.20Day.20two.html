<p>What I'm proposing we do would be to use a value set for lab tests on Day one (for the measure work we've been discussing RE: Positive diagnosis) based on <a href="http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1032.109">http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1032.109</a>.<br>
Then on Day 2 we use a NEW value Set in the same measure to replace the one originally specified above which is essentially the same, BUT, is missing<br>
one code: 94558-4 SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Ag [Presence] in Respiratory specimen by Rapid immunoassay</p>

<p>All other tests are gene tests, while this one is an antigen test.  That would mean the sample data would change to ensure we include that code in at least one place where the result would make a difference.  I can take care of that this weekend in the sample data.</p>
