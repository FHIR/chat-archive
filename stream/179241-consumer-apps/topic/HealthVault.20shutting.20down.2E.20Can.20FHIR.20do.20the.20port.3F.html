<p>Last week it was announced that Microsoft HealthVault is closing down, and patients will have until Nov 20 to get their data out. Does (or can or should) FHIR play any role in this?  I'm thinking about legitimate publicity as much as I am about technical urgency.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/microsoft-will-officially-shut-down-healthvault-later-year" target="_blank" title="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/microsoft-will-officially-shut-down-healthvault-later-year">MobiHealthNews</a> article says MS named AllScripts' <a href="https://www.followmyhealth.com" target="_blank" title="https://www.followmyhealth.com">FollowMyHealth app</a> as one way to move one's data elsewhere.  </li>

</ul>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> and anyone else from MS, any thoughts on this, official or not?</p>

<p>on my healthvault account. I am given the option to export in 4 formats: CCD, CCR, HTML, or XML. Only with HTML and XML do I get a choice to export everything.</p>

<p>The "XML" choice is a CDA without the CCD constraints.</p>

<p>correction.. I don't yet know what the "XML" choice is... My request to export everything to "XML" has timed out 3 times. Their web site auto-logs me out due to inactivity timeout... yet, I can't do anything because it is "exporting"... And I am not all that sick of a patient.</p>

<p>don't know anything about Lydia. if microsoft cared about healthvault, they woud have invested in doing it by FHIR. but since they're closing it down... it's a good bet that they don't care</p>

<p>In this thread at least, I'm not talking about whether they care about healthvault. It's 12 year old technology in any case. I'm solely pointing to the news. </p>
<p>In recent years as MU wound down I've learned that it's hard to get people's attention on something that doesn't have reimbursement attached to it or some other Maslow-lower-level factor, e.g. caring for one's mum or sick kid. And since I tire quickly of talking about things nobody cares about, I've learned to keep ears tuned to what's in the news already.</p>

<p>And it just so happened that right now is ten years plus a month since I announced I was going to put my data in Google Health and MS, which led to my discovering how incompetent some people in health IT were (are? I don't know) and thrust me into a spotlight not of my own design. So there's an interesting connection between that anniversary (which I'll be blogging) and this news. </p>
<p>A pervasive theme is the issue of "fitness for purpose." It's the IT professionalism fail that led some to think billing data was a valid proxy for clinical reality. The other was my hospital's absurd decision to declare victory when they had never tested the Google interface on real customer data. Then people were stunned when a patient with no health IT training (just a random day-job data jockey) discovered the emperor's new clothes were a fiction. </p>
<p>If I recall correctly (and contemporaries like <br>
@keith boone may correct me) the whole problem back then was that there WERE no use cases - just "Send them the data," which they did, and since no acceptance criteria were defined, the resulting load of crap that arrived could not be found wanting- except by common sense. </p>
<p>Like, no, I did NOT have metastases to the spine, nor non-rheumatoid tricuspid valve disease, etc etc. </p>
<p>Hm, this belongs in a wholly different thread. I'll move it later.</p>

<p>Note. Make sure when you try to extract your HealthVault data to use Chrome. Edge failed and continues to fail. I now have a complete dump of my HealthVault in propritary microsoft xml schema - "...GetThing3" -- 25 meg xml file, with 1.5 million lines of xml. --- 99% of the data is my daily updates from various personal health devices/software.</p>
