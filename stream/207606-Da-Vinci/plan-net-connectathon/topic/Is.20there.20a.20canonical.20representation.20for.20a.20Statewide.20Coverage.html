<p>1) As in the examples -- create a Location instance with the State specified, and possibly a GeoJSON<br>
2) In the reference, include the state name (or  2 char symbol) in the display/reference strings</p>
<p>Should one of these be the canonical approach?</p>

<p>Network.coverage area refers to the geographic area the network covers <br>
InsurancePlan.coverage area refers to the geographic area where the plan is available</p>
<p>A plan may be for all of a state, but the network may only be for part of the state.</p>
<p>BTW Medicare ffs is nationwide but a provider is only available in the state(s) where the have a valid license</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196359">@Robert Dieterle</span> Another question,  we have found that Medicare eligibility is by both County and State.  How do we map InsurancePlan.coveragearea to allow 3rd Party apps to search available plans by coverage area when both state and county should be specified?  Can we link in both through the reference.</p>

<p>Good afternoon <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="215604">@Saul Kravitz</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196359">@Robert Dieterle</span> , I would like to see if there is any way to include a collection of insurancePlan references into PractitionerRole &amp; OrganizationAffiliation resources. I have completed some analysis of customer data on our end and noticed that we have, at least one customer, that has a national network that supports their Medicare line of business. In our case, this national network does not directly tie into the list of Networks provided by the plan. In this case, it’s more of an inferred network that is applied when a search is conducted in our application via the Product/Plan the member has. The other thing we are noticing is, in some cases, there are over 90 Networks that make up a single Product/plan. The concern for this is around managing those 90+ networks and system load when the member or third-party system is trying to conduct a search.</p>

Is there a reason you can't combine the 90+ networks into a single (or a smaller number) of networks?<br>
If not, the client will need to iteratively query using a subset of the networks (first 10, next 10, etc).</p>

<p>Good morning <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="215604">@Saul Kravitz</span> , we do that already with our Plan's/Product's. We combine any number of networks into a single value for searching purposes and relevance to the member. However, the way the IG is written, we need to search by network and not Product which is why we are running into this problem.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="342457">@Robert Little</span>  So you are saying that in your model the association of practitioners/organizations to a network, is essentially an association to a product?   In Plan-Net (as per VhDir) the association between InsurancePlan (product with associated plans) to Networks is potentially many-to-many.</p>
