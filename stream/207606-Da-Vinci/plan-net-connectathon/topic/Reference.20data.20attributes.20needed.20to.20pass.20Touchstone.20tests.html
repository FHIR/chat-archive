<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191972">@Steve Munini</span> <br>
I haven't looked through all of these, but I did look at location.    I think there is a misunderstanding of "required" vs "Must Support".<br>
Truly required is minimum cardinality of &gt;=1.<br>
Must support with a minimum cardinality of 0 means (for a server) if you have it you must provide it, and (for a client) if you receive an instance that includes this element, you have to handle it gracefully.<br>
  Location</p>
<p>- partOf is MS 0..1 ("Another Location this one is physically a part of") --&gt;  not relevant for our example<br>
  -  endpoint is MS 0..* --&gt; we don't have any so we can't provide 'em.</p>

<p>ok.  Touchstone wants to test those search paths, so that is where the failures will occur.</p>

<p>To get all the Touchstone tests to pass, I added those attributes manually.</p>

<p>Yup you can still pass the validation without having those elements, but Touchstone cannot test specific Queries (which <em>are</em> SHALL support) without having at least one resource populate those values (and this have at least one resource in the expected response)<br>
We're planning some quality of life asserts to help describe this, but those haven't been written yet.</p>
