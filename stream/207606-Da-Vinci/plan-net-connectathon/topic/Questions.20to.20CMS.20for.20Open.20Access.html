Below is what I came up with, please feel free to rephrase and/or add additional details as needed:<br>
Does using a public anonymous token to access the service comply with the CMS requirement of having public access to the Provider Directory?  <br>
This approach will not limit the access to an individual person.  <br>
It will ensure that the service accessed by an application gets tracked properly, stats gets collected &amp; also allows us to manage the scalability and protect the service in a better way.</p>

<p>what do you think of this version:<br>
We understand, and agree, why CMS does not want to place barriers between an individual and their accessibility to the Provider Directory API. We are not proposing barriers between an individual and the information provided by the API.<br>
What we are asking for clarification is on the following: can we secure access to the Provider Directory API from the 3rd party applications consuming the API?<br>
Several mechanisms are widely and commonly used by organizations offering public access APIs; for example' using a public anonymous token, or a clientID/Secret combination.<br>
This approach would not make it any harder for an individual to use the API. However, it will ensure the service accessed by a 3rd party application is properly tracked to the application being used, statistics are collected, and allows us to manage the scalability, and most importantly protects the API from attacks (which would now be traceable to the application - not the individual).</p>

<p>I wasn't here for the discussion so I'm inferring what might have led up to this question. That said, I would have hoped that plans could publish provider directories essentially essentially as flat public FHIR resource collections (e.g., bundles, or ndjson files) that could be publicly hosted. Having to deal with obtaining a token and then following some special protocol just to access these data seems like an extra/unnecessary step. Is the primary goal to prevent denial of service attacks? For static public stuff there are more transparent ways (e.g. whatever bags of tricks your CDN deploys).</p>

<p>there may be a bunch of other contexts where access control makes more sense. But for me the fundamental use case here is about getting information out of a silo and into places where it can be aggregated and made more useful. For example, I would not expect most plans to offer a really excellent search-as-you-type API experience with well-honed results -- but I could definitely imagine a third party building that if the data were available.</p>

<p>So to be specific, I expect it would meet CMS requirements if plans hosted a public file with all the data and no access control. (Then as a "value add", plans might offer additional APIs that might maybe have requirements like public authentication tokens and so forth.)</p>

<p>I've been assuming the same but as it turns out some people think we can NOT ask API consumers to identify themselves, therefore we are asking CMS to clarify if we can. </p>
<p>Josh, some plans may choose to offer the entire PD as you described. I'm not sure that meets the mandate given the mandate strongly urges us to implement a PD API. But if a plan decides to publish their entire PD as a "static" file asking for security on the file may not be important to them. <br>
However, if they are building APIs and expect 3rd party apps to interact with the APIs, I think it is totally reasonable (given most of the Internet works this way) we ask the developers to identify their applications.</p>
<p>.What do you think?</p>

<p>I think <code>GET /path/to/directory.ndjson</code> is an API, and a simple one at that. Should be open/available. If this is available, I'm much less worried about access control on finer-grained APIs.</p>

<p>So, it sounds like there are two questions:<br>
Pre-amble:<br>
We understand, and agree, why CMS does not want to place barriers between an individual and their accessibility to the Provider Directory API. We are not proposing barriers between an individual and the information provided by the API.   What we are asking for clarification is on the following: </p>
<p>1) (Josh) Plans could publish provider directories essentially essentially as flat public IG-compliant FHIR resource collections (e.g., bundles, or ndjson files) that could be publicly hosted.   Would an API supporting retrieval of such files (e.g., GET /path/to/directory.ndjson) satisfy CMS requirements for open access?<br>
2) (Neophytos, Anand, Shaheer) From non functional requirements perspective (security, performance etc) consumer of API(developer of 3rd party App) should require authentication. All API consumers(apps, not users) should be known and use API key(or other auth mechanism) so Payer as a provider of API knows who all the callers/developers are (this is standard industry approach today). Developers could intentionally or accidently bombard API which may create issues. (please reword as needed)Can we secure access to the Provider Directory API from the 3rd party applications consuming the API?<br>
Several mechanisms are widely and commonly used by organizations offering public access APIs; for example' using a public anonymous token, or a clientID/Secret combination.<br>

However, it will ensure the service accessed by a 3rd party application is properly tracked to the application being used, statistics are collected, and allows us to manage the scalability, and most importantly protects the API from attacks (which would now be traceable to the application - not the individual).</p>

<p>Good afternoon Team, Sorry it took me so long to get into this... <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="215604">@Saul Kravitz</span> , I believe your summary is accurate. I'm good with the way you have positioned the questions. The goal is NOT to limit the member but to be able to monitor and have some control over the third party application that is using the end points to ensure they are not using the end points for inappropriate purposes. This ask is not requesting anything more than what is currently industry standard.</p>
