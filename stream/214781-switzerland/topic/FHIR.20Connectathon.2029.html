<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Does any publicly available test server exist for testing any of the Swiss FHIR profiles? We're running an International Patient Access track at the FHIR Connectathon in January, and are interested in collecting information on all international FHIR implementations.</p>
<p>At the connectathon, our main goal is to test as many client and server implementations as possible, against each other. We're interested in all country-specific server implementations, <strong>even if people running those servers would not be able to join the connectathon or the IPA track</strong> - as long as there is a test server or a sandbox environment publicly available.</p>
<p>More info on the IPA track is in <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2022-01+International+Patient+Access">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2022-01+International+Patient+Access</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond the connectathon, we're also interested in listing information on country-specific FHIR implementations in the IPA Implementation Guide.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192917">@Mikael Rinnetmäki</span> thanks for reaching out to the swiss channel!</p>
<p>We do have released for the Swiss EPR a mHealth Specification which is also based on IUA/IHE Profiles and should work with  Smart On FHIR: <a href="http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-epr-mhealth/index.html">http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-epr-mhealth/index.html</a>. I think we need to analyse the difference between IPA and our specification.</p>
<p>Part of the EPR mHealth Specification is already implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/i4mi/MobileAccessGateway">Mobile Access Gateway</a>, however the Access part is not yet complete and we do not have yet test system online available.</p>
<p>I will participate in the connectathon next week, mainly in Questionnaire track, but i registered also for IPA/IPS so I can for sure "zoom" over.</p>
