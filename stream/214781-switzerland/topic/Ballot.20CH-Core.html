<p>If you have not yet registered to the CH Core ballot you need to do by tonight by sending me an e-mail. </p>
<p>The CH Core STU2 implementation guide has been <a href="http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-core/index.html">published</a>.</p>
<p>You can find the changes compared to STU1 <a href="http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-core/comparison-v1.0.0/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>At the bottom of every page you will find a 'Propose a change' link and we look forward to specific feedback on how we can improve the implementation guide, regardless of how you vote for the ballot.</p>
<p>If you do not agree with the changes and you answer the ballot with no, you have to justify this with feedback, please refer to the 'Propose a change' issues that you have entered, you can find them as Github Issues <a href="https://github.com/hl7ch/ch-core/issues">here</a>. We will then try to resolve any relevant negative comments, the process is also described under Ballot rules with the schedule here.</p>
<p>In parallel, the informative ballot for <a href="http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-emed/index.html">CH EMED</a> and <a href="http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-vacd/index.html">CH VACD</a> are running in cooperation with eHealth Suisse, please send your feedback there also via the respective Propose-a-change link by March 15, 2021.</p>
