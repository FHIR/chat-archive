<p>How to deal with patient’s agreement to your App Terms and Conditions (e.g., Privacy Policy, User Agreement) which include rules about personal health information sharing? For example, what FHIR resources should be used to record the relevant information? Thank you for any responses.</p>

<p>Example Scenario: When a patient want to register her/himself as a new user of your health management app (and install the app on her/his mobile phone), the patient just check the 'I Agree' box before her/he could complete subsequent steps. And the app's server just records the internal ID for the new user, the user confirmation timestamp and the Policy/Agreement. But there is no digital signature or any scanned copy of a wet-signed contract.</p>
