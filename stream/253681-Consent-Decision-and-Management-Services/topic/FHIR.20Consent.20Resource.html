<p>Is the intent of <a href="http://consent.provision.data">consent.provision.data</a> to capture the data domains(immunizations ) that a user gave consent to share or deny?</p>

<p>The .data element is expected to be used when there are explicit instances that need to be explicitly permitted or denied. The .meaning allows you to indicate that the scope is just that instance, any other instances that are related, any other instances that point at this instance, or any data authored by this instance.  So for example one could point at an encounter and indicate that the scope (meaning) is dependent. That would be a way to Permit or Deny access to everything relevant to that encounter.<br>
This presumes that the access control decision engine supports this very advanced concept.</p>

<p>Thank you <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span>  for your detailed explanation.  Let's say A patient  consents App2 to use their lab data from App1, but not any other clinical data that exists in App1, How is this consent captured in the FHIR consent resource.</p>

<p>not enough information about the policies covering data persistence and lifecycle management or the data profiling. FHIR Core is just an interoperability specification, not a systems design.</p>

<p>One could imagine a setup where all data created by App1 has an author indicating the device of App1. Thus one could use that device as the linkage. This would also be highly reliant on policies refusing to allow updates of the data to remove this device authorship. And would be relying on access control infrastructure that can handle this complex of a rule.</p>
