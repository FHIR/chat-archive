<p>There is a US-centric project for an implementation guide to represent COVID vaccination certificates.<br>
Current version (in development): <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/branches/main/">https://build.fhir.org/ig/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/branches/main/</a>.

Considering that the goal is similar and that a lot of this stuff could be used for international travel probably worth considering that and try to align</p>

<p>Judging from the recent Global Consortium for eHealth Interoperability (HL7, IHE &amp; HIMSS) meeting, there appears to be some appetite for alignment between 3 of the major global initiatives - Digital Green Certificate (EU), Vaccine Credential Initiative  (US vendors &amp; 'tech titans') and Smart Vaccination Certificates (WHO).  One notable absence was the IATA (Travel Pass Initiative).</p>
<p>The 3 groups who presented at the meeting all cited use of FHIR, to some degree, even to the level of using the IPS Immunization Profile, although there was an indication from the VCI Stream at the Connectathon today that the WHO is no longer doing that (not sure if that's related to the contentious ICD-11 v SNOMED CT terminology issue).</p>

<p>Agreed that we need these efforts to align (and the WHO has been closely tracking these).   <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191364">@Peter Jordan</span>  I am curious as to the origin of the "WHO is not doing IPS on the VCI stream" as the IG does depend on IPS (or at least a draft version of IPS that relaxes some of the constraints around gender).</p>

<p>SHC/VCI was meeting with IPS track at HL7 connectathon and we were comparing IPS to VCI, <br>

but I don't know if <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="322501">@Max Masnick</span> looked at that or if it is different.</p>
<p>I don't recall seeing or hearing anything that said SVC is not doing something with IPS.<br>

<p>the point is that there is not yet a release that you can explicitly refer in the IG dependency, that the reasone of the 'pre-uv-ips' profiles here and likely in the next version of the EU DGC</p>

<p>FYI: the only place we would be using custom resources is to condense the json representations of a QResp before encoding in a QR code (e.g. as a part of the serialization step).  This can shave 2-3 off the version size of a QR code over a raw QResp.  Plan is to have mappings from WHO to DGC, ICAO (or at least for the subset of data that is within the WHO coredata set -  ICAO for example have required travel document ID which WHO won't have)</p>

<p>I'm in line with you , but what is not clear to me yet is "what" needs to be harmonized.. there is the risk to compare "apples with pears". or attempt to harmonize different things.</p>

<p>E.g., you cannot compare profiles used to generate QR code for accessing private venues, with more generic profiles from which the "QR data" are extracted ..</p>

<p>so the first step IMHO should be that of classifying these profiles, in order to compare the same things, assuming as starting point that all of them could be derived from the IPS ones</p>

<p>Agree on this (for the to be released IPS).  We will have, I think, in the WHO spec a transaction that defines something like "going from a shared health record that's compliant with IPS to the WHO SVC"</p>
