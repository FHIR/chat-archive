<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I'm just wrapping my head around all this, so sorry if it's already been covered somewhere.</p>
<p>I'm not 100% clear on the document format, so I may have some misconceptions.  I thought the document Bundle should include all the sections from the composition, so shouldn't the immunization resource be in the document Bundle?  Also, should the signature be required in this bundle?</p>
<p>In RC2 of the IG for the QR resource, I've had issues trying to use custom resources (e.g. HAPI would need code to make it work), so I've used Basic resources with extensions, but there may also be other options.  It seems SUSHI also has issues with this from the shorthand chat, although there is a workaround.  I also looked at making it a logical model, but that doesn't seem quite right either.  Is this solely to pull together data from the other resources to represent the content embedded in the QR code? </p>
<p>Does the QR code also need an id of the signer so you can find and check the signature?  Either through mCSD if it's in a health worker registry or some way to find it in the NPKD?</p>

<p>Agree, this was also one of my comments, a doc bundle should include all the resources the composition is referring to</p>

<p>I've questions on the QR resource too, not clear to me how it is supposed to be used.<br>
In the EU guide we have three logical model for the three cases (see <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7-eu/dgc/models.html">https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7-eu/dgc/models.html</a>); but for the time being these are not what is expected to be serialized.</p>

<p>I'd be happy to help but not sure what and how to change things :-) ... maybe a call may help</p>

<p>Yes, I think a call would help.   Would be good to bring in <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193299">@Luke Duncan</span>  to that as he is going to have some dedicated time to support.   <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191415">@Giorgio Cangioli</span>  are there a few slots this week you could offer?</p>

<p>Also, I got your pull request merged in (more or less).  It looks like you were using an early version of the repo, so I had to manual merge.  I think everything got sorted more or less, except I have a few questions on the IPS / provisional IPS that it would be good to talk through</p>
