<p>Was testing out the FHIR plugin for Mirth Connect, which works off a database design that basically only has 1 table called "resource".    Every message and operation I throw at it seems to work.  Two questions:   Is this a bad idea to do or should we be looking to adopt a schema like FHIRBASE, where there is a table for each resource<br>
?    <br>
 And this table, although Mirth accepts JSON and XML, stores the message as XML.   Is there a disadvantage to this or would storing the JSON be preferred?</p>

<p>I'm a big believer that if it works, it works.  So, if it works, go with it.  And the XML vs JSON format isn't really important as FHIR innately supports both (and Turtle) so, store it in whatever works best for your use case</p>

<p>How you store is primarily driven by how you need to query/analyze.  Storing resources as a blob is a very viable strategy when the only interface accessing the data will be FHIR-based.  On the other hand, if you need to perform ad-hoc query and analysis or need to expose the data over other types of interfaces, it may not work well.  There's a whole stream (<a class="stream" data-stream-id="179289" href="/#narrow/stream/179289-storage-for-FHIR">#storage for FHIR</a>) dedicated to the tradeoffs of different approaches to FHIR-based persistence.</p>
