<p>We are using ServiceRequest to order services like nurses to go and provide care to a patient.<br>
In some cases, the care is "apply / give medication/give a vaccine/..." - for which it makes sense to use a medicationrequest</p>

<p>I think this may tie into the advanced structure of ServiceRequest we're doing for R5, or perhaps it is as simple as having a RequestGroup.</p>

<p>but perhaps other ideas will exist - CarePlan?</p>

<p>I could see that a CarePlanyields multiple ServiceRequest for which there is an interest to keep them together.  However, when to use RequestGroup vs. ServiceReuest.basedOn is not clear to me as I still don't understand the purpose of RequestGroup given its expansive structure.  There seems some overlap between RequestGroup, CarePlan, and PlanDefinition.  Patient Care and CDS would be in a better spot to clarify those boundaries.  ServiceRequest would just indicate what it is based on or what it represents (code, plan, etc.)</p>
