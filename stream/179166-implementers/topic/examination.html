<p>Hi all, we are using observation resource to capture the information of various types of examination. In general examination, there are many subtypes for instance examination of lung,abdomen and many more.  So, shall I create profiles for each and every  subtype or is there any other alternate method to capture?  Thanks in advance</p>

<p>If you want to enforce different rules for each subtype and it's not a simple set of rules that you could do using invariants or something like that on a single profile, then you'd need a profile for each subtype.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  Thank you.  We want to create fhir profile similar to that of the examination archetypes in openEHR.  For example, in the archetype examination of a burn, there are some clusters namely structured body site, examination findings,multimedia representation and examination not done and some groups are included in each cluster. How can I add the clusters and their respective sub groups to a fhir profile?  Is it possible to add extensions for observation.component? Please suggest me. Thank you</p>

<p>Well, your starting point would likely be Observation.  You'd then figure out what structures to use to represent the different pieces (e.g. the BodySite data type, various component or related Observations, etc.  Where you're not sure, certainly raise questions here to get guidance.  It's possible to add extensions to pretty much anything, but I suspect most of what you need done won't involve using extension at all.</p>

<p>That one's actually a little tricky.  If you were talking about a surgery or some other intervention, you could use Procedure.notDone and Procedure.notDoneReason.  However, examinations are really Observations.  Observation has dataAbsentReason, but that's not quite the same thing.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> - thoughts on how best to handle this?</p>

<p>You'll have to start by mapping all of the data elements and figuring out where they live in FHIR.  Odds are you may need multiple resources to represent the full examination - and most of those will be Observations.  You may also need to determine what Observation codes (generally from LOINC) you'll need to use to describe the different observations being performed.  Once you've figured out where your data lives, you can use a tool like Forge to create the various resource profiles needed to represent your model.</p>

<p>I'm not super-familiar with openEHR, but, from what I understand, you don't use the cluster concept in the same way with FHIR.  For example, if openEHR allows you to use a cluster on a record of a surgery and have the same type of cluster appear on a blood pressure, there's no way you could get a re-usable structure that would appear on both the FHIR Procedure resource and the FHIR Observation resource unless it was an esoteric requirement handled using an extension.  You'll have to map each cluster to each resource you want to use it on.  (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>, please yell if I've misspoken)</p>

This resource is the preferred representation of such forms of information as it exposes the metadata relevant for interpreting the information.

<p>If you want one profile, you could just define a value set that identifies the allowed Observation codes and/or body sites</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  In our use case, we have Multi Organ System examination which is further divided into Eyes, ENT, Respiration, Chest/Axilla, Cardiovascular etc. Moreover, the organs in turn have different findings. For example, examination of ear comprises of organs namely external ears, tympanic membrane and ear canal, which have their respective findings. <br>
So, how can I implement this hierarchy in the profile? <br>
Also,how can I capture "No Abnormality Detected " and "Normal Except"(which contains different findings)? The Observation.value can take only one value set, how can I bind multiple value sets (findings)?<br>
If I am creating profile for the "Examination of Tympanic Membrane", where can I attach the code of the tympanic membrane (Observation.code or Observation.bodySite)?</p>

<p>If you want different value sets for each body part examined, then you'll need a different profile for each.  If you want the results back with a hierarchical organization, then you'll need to define profiles for Observations at the "panel" level which have a bunch of "related" member observations as well as profiles for the leaf-level parts.  Normal except would be an observation with related member observations that identify the exceptions.</p>

<p>Hi all,  I need to create a profile for GU system male. Can I consider CVA Tenderness, Rectal Examination,Bladder, Urine and Catheter as components for Observation profile? ,Also, can I capture 'Male Genitalia' (Observation.related )as another Observation which comes  under the main Observation GU male, appearance and palpation as components? Moreover,  the Observation.component 'Bladder' has a valueset tenderness and distension, the valueset in turn has both absent and present respectively.Can I capture the pair "Absent" and "Present" in an extension? Thank you</p>

<p>Tenderness, Rectal examination, etc. sound like they could/should be stand-alone Observations.  I.e. someone could look at them by themselves and understand them and possibly make decisions based on them.  They're sort of like a "white blood cell count" in a blood panel.  They might be commonly reported as a group, but they're useful by themselves.  Component is used for things that aren't useful by themselves.  For example, if you were capturing a sensitivity test, the notion of "sensitive/insensitive" and "what drug was the specimen tested against" aren't useful on their own.  You always need them both together to understand what's going on.  Looking at either on its own is useless.</p>
<p>The pattern to follow for your data is to have a parent observation that has a "has member" relationship to a bunch of other observations - one each for CVA Tenderness, Bladder, etc.  You'll need some clinical guidance as to whether bladder tenderness and bladder distension should be captured as components or as further "has member" observations.  I don't know the area well enough to understand whether bladder tenderness and bladder distension can function stand alone or not.  (My guess is that they can, but I'm a non-clinician, so my guesses don't count :))</p>

<p>The reason for the number of observations is to support and independent distribution - the notion is that any one of these might need to be queried on its own - possibly with historical observations of the same type for comparison.  It might also be necessary to pass some subset of the information as part of a document, message or decision support operation invocation.  So yes, there will potentially be a large number of observations, but each can stand alone.  You might choose to send a whole package of Observations as a transaction or batch (in REST) or otherwise packaged in a document or message.</p>
