<p>I’m trying to determine if it makes sense to store clinical decision support rule definitions for compounding software in FHIR.</p>
<p>Some rules are straightforward inside their patient population context:  <br>
Limit sodium intake to 10mEq per day</p>
<p>Others add complexity by including parameters of the patient: <br>
Limit glucose intake to 12mg per kg per minute </p>
<p>Other rules depend on other components of the compounded order as a basis: <br>
Include 1mmol Calcium per 1 mmol phosphorus. </p>
<p>The definition of PlanDefinition states it is “…general enough to support the description of a broad range of clinical artifacts such as clinical decision support rules, order sets and protocols.”, which makes me think this is the right resource to use but I’m uncertain on how I would execute it.<br>
There are so many resources that, to me, seem like they could be molded to my use-case but I’m having difficulty decisively nailing down the implementation. <br>
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>This is useful. Thanks, Bryn! Looking at the example below, specifically:<br>
<a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-recommendations/PlanDefinition-va-ckd-recommendations.html" title="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-recommendations/PlanDefinition-va-ckd-recommendations.html">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-recommendations/PlanDefinition-va-ckd-recommendations.html</a> </p>
<p>For my purposes, the resource boils down to a patient population specific recommendation for a protein intake of 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg/day. Would it be appropriate to add an extension that slices or granularizes this portion of the resource by using a Substance or Medication to represent protein, a group to represent the patient population (CKD 3 or 4)  and a dosage to represent the range? I would also need a way to reference a patient for the weight basis. </p>
<p>The current system uses objects like those described above to evaluate different recommendations that target the same factor (i.e. protein intake) a determines if any of them take precedence in the real-time context. Given that all the patient and prescription information is FHIR, it would be nice to not have to store the CDS rules in a separate database.</p>
