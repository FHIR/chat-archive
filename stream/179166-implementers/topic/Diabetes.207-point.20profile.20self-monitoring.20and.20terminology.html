<p>We are setting up a pilot situation in The Netherlands where we are exchanging blood glucose data from a patient using his personal health record to his caregiver. This is done using FHIR Observation. Patient and caregiver use the 7-point profile (<a href="https://www.idf.org/webdata/docs/SMBG_EN2.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://www.idf.org/webdata/docs/SMBG_EN2.pdf">https://www.idf.org/webdata/docs/SMBG_EN2.pdf</a>): so before breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, after lunch, before dinner, after dinner and at bedtime.</p>
<p>We are struggling to find appropriate terminology. Started out looking at LOINC, but LOINC does not give the 'before meal' nor the 'bedtime'. Also LOINC does not distinguish between breakfast, lunch and dinner. This may not be relevant for laboratories, but it is for patient - physician communication and properly assigning blood glucose levels at the right point in the 7-point scale.</p>
<p>Is there any experience with this use case and which terminology was considered / chosen?</p>

<p>WE are considering adding the Timing datatype to the Observation.effective{x] since its part of the Event workflow pattern.  Also this same issue was broached in an earlierMhealth meeting I had.  </p>
<p>so would it work if :</p>

<p>Actually, one more question: is it possible to also express '2 hours after breakfast/lunch/diner'? I see STU3 having 'offset' for this? So if the event is after meal, does an offset of 2 hours then mean '2 hours after meal'?</p>

<p>The offset can be positive or negative.  So with a negative number, you could technically say 2 hours before "after meal", though that would be weird.  Two hours before bedtime would be reasonable though.</p>

<p>Thanks for the explanation Lloyd. </p>
<p>The definition of offset on  "<a href="http://build.fhir.org/datatypes.html#Timing" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/datatypes.html#Timing">http://build.fhir.org/datatypes.html#Timing</a>" however, is unsignedInt?</p>
<p>I agree with your reasoning however and find it a lot more clear to use negative numbers for earlier and positive numbers for later.</p>
<p>Following your reasoning the example 'BID, 30 mins before meal, for next 10 days' on "<a href="http://build.fhir.org/datatypes.html#Timing" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/datatypes.html#Timing">http://build.fhir.org/datatypes.html#Timing</a>" would have to be corrected along with the offset Type? It has an offset of '30', but if it is before it would have to be '-30'?</p>
<p>Should we raise a ticket?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191437">@Arianne van de Wetering</span> Your friendly terminologist here and I'm worried that an approach that ignores part of the meaning of the concepts in the FHIR TimingEvent code system (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/TimingEvent/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/TimingEvent/index.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/TimingEvent/index.html</a>) is simply bad form. You either need to craft a process that restricts the valueset of the noted codes to only those that describe "after event" timing, then only allow positive offests, and the same for the "before event" codes with a negative offset. Or you can allow either positive or negative offsets and restrict the timing concepts to those that only describe the event without a timing element added. You can't do what Lloyd suggested where you get to ignore the timing element of the concept while using the event part. That would be like using the concept "Acute renal failure" for any type of renal failure and adding the chonicity into some other attribute. You get the picture - No bueno! While I like the code system (latin - I'm a doc and all) if you chose to represent the timing part via the offset +/- and the event alone, I'd suggest a different set of concepts as these latin phrases are really used as timing+event ideas - no one alive would refer to a meal as "cibus". </p>

<p>The event codes identify a specific point in time - the time you start a meal, the time you're done your meal, the time you wake up, the time you go to sleep, etc.  It's quite reasonable to indicate that something should occur an hour before you go to sleep, but it's also reasonable that some test or measurement might need to occur an hour *after* you go to sleep.  While it might be slightly weird to say "do something 10 minutes before the end of lunch" and extremely weird to say "do something 2 hours before the end of lunch", the meaning of it is clear - and I don't think we're abusing the terminology in any way by doing so.  The offset needs to be able to be negative to support reasonable requirements.  The fact it enables "weird" requirements can be addressed through usage notes, but shouldn't prevent us from meeting the reasonable use-cases.</p>

<p>I find an offset of +30, meaning 30 minutes later when combined with  after lunch, but meaning 30 minutes earlier when combined with before lunch really unclear.</p>
<p>What would an offset of 2 hours mean when combined with 'lunch'. Before or after? That would be unclear, right? Is an offset not allowed when the event does not include the word 'before' or 'after'? </p>
<p>So allowing the + and - for 'after' and 'before' is much better, and I guess Robert is not really disputing that. </p>
<p>I do tend to agree that I cannot think of a real use case for "10 minutes before the end of lunch", but addressing that through usage notes as per Lloyds suggestion is good enough.</p>

<p>Arianne van de Wetering: I see the effective is 0..1, does that mean I cannot combine the 'after lunch' with a proper date/time (after lunch, which was at 16:00 hours)</p>
<p>Eric Haas: the timing datatype can have a datetime and when. At least I don't see an invarient prohibiting it</p>
<p>Eric Haas: A change to the cardinality of Observation.effective[x] would require a new tracker and a very compelling argument and use cases.</p>
<p>Arianne van de Wetering: the timing can indeed also have a datetime the event took place.<br>
But if you do an observation with just a datetime (another blood glucose measurement, just because you feel dizzy or whatever) then the datetime ends in a different field than when doing the regular after lunch thing.<br>
In general I am not fan of letting the same thing land at two different locations... When reading the resource and plotting every observation over the day, you would have to look for datetime at two different places...<br>
don't know if that's compelling enough though</p>

<p>No, I mean quite the opposite. The exact date/time the observation was done is a different thing than the event. <br>
so: a measurement was before my lunch today. I did the observation at 11:45.<br>
yesterday the before lunch observation for me was at 13:30 hours, because I had lunch later due to a meeting or whatever other cause</p>
<p>next to the event (before lunch, after lunch) the exact timing the observation was done also has value</p>

<p>I totally misunderstood your use case.   if a patient reports a event as occuring at "dinner" that would be the effective time.  If you want to have an actual time eg 5:55 PM and then associate this with the "dinner" observation,   I would express it in the code as "dinner BG" or as a component or create an extension.   </p>

<p>Hi all, I'm the one that made Arianne ask this question about the 7 point scale :-). The TimingEvent can do the job, combines with the effectivedatetime in an Observation. See the screenshots from the iGluco app. This information is sent to the GP.<br>

<p>I'll stick to my guns and if you really want both the when and the timestamp then your question in the question answer pair using  the FHIR Observation resource should   be - my "lunchtime  ( dinnertime, etc) BG"  the answer would be '80 mg/dL' with a timestamp.   Alternatively you could ask two component questions 1) my 'BG' and 2) 'when'    with component answer 1) would be '80mg/dL' and answer 2) would be "lunch"  with a single timestamp.</p>

<p>but I really doubt that sticking Timing on Observation is at all useful without a big redefinition of the TIming datatype, since all it's definitions are future, and also of all the event codes. </p>

<p>why doesn't it work for both? effectiveTime = [date], code = 'before lunch', offset = -1 hr</p>

<p>Its unclear to me what you are thinking...</p>
<p>This is what I understand we were talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>effective[x] 0..1 dateTime|Period| EventTiming    where EventTiming is  code  + offset.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Adding essentially a mapping of the code+offset is not something I think the effective element should be used for.</p>

<p>I thought it would be additional attributes since you'd at least need a day for the observation, which is effectiveTime</p>

<p>Now I see the flaw in my understanding<br>
so <br>
Effective <br>
   dateTime 0..1 <br>
   Period  0..1<br>
   event 0..1 code<br>
   offset 0.1  integer with invarient  or new datatype = eventTiming</p>

<p>If patient reports to me it happened last night at dinner or about three weeks ago.  that is the effective time relative to issued date.  I am assuming no machine is reporting this information real time. </p>

<p>That is different than an app where you pick the Dinner time BG and the the app records the time it was recorded.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> following up on this  -we need an eventTiming datatype or something for fuzzy effective times .  I'll concede the issued time is the  app  reporting time.  Next steps?  assume this is a topic for the next round</p>

<p>Another question: the offset is currently defined to be in minutes and minutes only. Why?</p>
<p>I would interpret a patient statement: "2 hours after meal" differently than "120 minutes after meal", due to the extra precision added with the minutes statement.</p>
<p>I would prefer to also allow the unit 'hour' in offset? At least for the  self measurement use case.</p>

<p>We were trying to keep things simple - the data type is already rather complex.  Can OO, Pharmacy and PC have a discussion about whether the distinction between specifying minutes vs. hours is necessary/relevant?</p>
