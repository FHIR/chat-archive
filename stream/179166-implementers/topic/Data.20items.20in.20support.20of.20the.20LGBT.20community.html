<p>I've been asked about some data items that are used in support of the LGBT community, and just wanted to check my modelling (and whether there's any thoughts of addressing some of these in later FHIR versions)<br>
<em>title</em> - is OK as this is just a string on HumanName<br>
<em>sexual orientation</em> - an Observation<br>
<em>sex</em> - an Observation<br>
<em>gender</em> - a bit trickier, as the values are male, female, other &amp; unknown - which may not be broad enough (and they are Required)<br>
<em>any flag to indicate gender change</em> - an Observation? - or might this be better served as an extension?</p>

<p>Gender change should be an Observation - there are more abilities to manage sensitive information at the resource level than there are at the element level.</p>

<p>I'm curious about the meaning of "gender change" in this context. Is this meant to be an update of the social concept of gender identity?  In that case, I'd expect it to be tracked in the genderIdentity extension, where change is denoted via history.  Or this about a clinical change in sex properties such as hormone therapy or affirmation surgeries?  Those would normally be more substantive that just a single observation.</p>

<p>it would be interesting to get a full record of the whole process and try and represent it in FHIR and see if there's any gaps</p>

<p>I have a meeting tomorrow to go over the requirements - so I'll document the full list of requirements &amp; post here. The genderIdentity extension is useful.</p>

<p>It seems to me that patient.gender is notionally aligned with birth sex, and that the genderIdentity extension can be used for capturing the broader gender data. Is this an accurate interpretation?</p>

<p>Also, why does US Core have birth sex when it's essentially the same valueSet as Patient.gender?</p>

<p>Patient.gender is used for searching and categorizing the patient as they are <em>now</em>.  If someone currently identifies/presents as female, then that will be their Patient.gender, regardless of how they were classified at birth.</p>

<p>Isn't the valueset for gender much too narrow then to restrict to male | female | other | unknown, as there are many others?<br>

<p>Did you read the usage notes towards the bottom of the Patient resource that talk about gender? :)</p>
