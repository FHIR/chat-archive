<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>   Hi Grahame and Lloyd, through some tooling I've been building, I've found a handful of inconsistencies in some of the fhir profiles, most of which I've confirmed with one or both of you in previous threads, and you've asked for tasks to be filed regarding them.  It's about 3-4 oneoffs, and the a couple of categories of more common inconsistencies between snapshot and differential.  Would you prefer these as several tasks, or one cover task?  I've got a google doc I could link to that outlines these</p>

<p>Generally, if it's the same issue that manifests multiple places, one issue.  If it's different issues that seem likely to have separate fixes, submit different issues.</p>

<p>fair enough.  I filed 3 separate issues for one-off issues with 3 different structure definitions, and one catch-all for issues that affect many profiles.  Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.  (e.g., if it would be useful to add sample diffs, against the versions of the fhir definitions at <a href="http://github.com/google/fhir" target="_blank" title="http://github.com/google/fhir">github.com/google/fhir</a></p>

<p>I will ask you if I want more information</p>
