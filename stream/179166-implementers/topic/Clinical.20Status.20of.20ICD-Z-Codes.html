<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have a maybe very specific question. As you're aware, ICD10CM contains a lot of Z-Codes dealing with "Personal history of ...", e.g. "Z85.6 Personal history of leukemia". My question: when representing this as a FHIR condition, what to set in the clinical status? Is it "resolved", as the patient doesn't have a leukemia any more, or is it "active" as the patient has an active condition of "Personal history of leukemia". </p>
<p>Any help or hint who could answer me that question, greatly appreciated.<br>
All the best<br>
Philipp</p>

<p>Note that Condition.clinicalStatus is optional (0..1).  There is an invariant, con-3, that conditionally requires clinicalStatus (Condition.clinicalStatus SHALL be present if verificationStatus is not entered-in-error and category is problem-list-item), but it's only a guideline.  The invariant explains why it is only a guideline:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is (only) a best practice guideline because:<br>
Most systems will expect a clinicalStatus to be valued for problem-list-items that are managed over time, but might not need a clinicalStatus for point in time encounter-diagnosis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking, in the US, problems are codified using SNOMED whereas diagnoses are codified using ICD-10.  In short, if you don't have a clinicalStatus, then it isn't required.</p>

<p>Hi Michelle,</p>
<p>thanks a lot for your information. I understand that clinicalStatus is not required. Nevertheless, can/should an ICD-Z-Code like "Z85.6 Personal history of leukemia" have a clinicalStatus "RESOLVED" or rather "ACTIVE"? I would argue for "ACTIVE" as I would say once you had a leukemia, you always have an ACTIVE state of "Personal history of leukemia", but I'm not sure whether my assumption is right?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your help.<br>
Philipp</p>
