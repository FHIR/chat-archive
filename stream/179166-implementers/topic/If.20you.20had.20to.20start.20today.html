<p>How would you set up your FHIR server if you had to do it today. Would you use google's API or would you do your own server?  What resources would you consult.</p>

<p>you could run a cloud FHIR server - both google and microsoft have them<br>
or you could run your own server - HAPI, FHIRBase, Vonk are the obvious candidates, depending on your platform and functional requirements<br>
Or you could run one of them in a cloud in a managed server</p>
