<p>It was established be me as part of the Jira design after seeing numerous instances where people commented on gForge tracker items that had been resolved and nothing happened (because no one ever looks at tracker items that have been resolved and very few people monitor all of the update notifications that stream through their inbox).</p>
<p>What is the use-case for recording comments on an issue that's already resolved (as opposed to opening a new issue that references the original)?</p>

<p>I'm seeing Lloyd's point - if I have a JIRA issue that has been resolved and implemented, how would commenting achieve anything?  What does a workgroup do with a comment that is entered after the issue has been implemented?  It seems to make more sense to me to force commenters to create a new JIRA issue with their concerns and our comments so that they can actually be seen by the workgroup.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I agree that<code>resolved - change required</code> should count as closed in this context.  I know that I've wanted to post comments on issues with that state (e.g., here's an implementation, do people agree it works).</p>

<p>so you don't see that commenting on a closed/resolved ticket essentially means your comment goes into the ether?  Again, I'll ask:  What does a workgroup do with a comment that is entered after the issue has been resolved, voted on, and implemented?  If you just want to comment about the implementation, I guess that is okay, but if you're actually trying to re-open the issue or provide dissenting feedback, I believe that opening up a new Jira issue makes more sense.</p>

<p>A JIRA issue pretty much has full history capacity, so you won't necessary have to create a new issue in order to track changes, unless thats the process you feel most comfortable with (which is sane IMHOP). But the current proces simply not allowing commenting seems a bit rigid</p>

<p>to be clear, it does allow commenting - up and until the issue is closed.  and Lloyd gave the rationale for why we don't allow commenting after the issue has been closed which seems reasonable to me.</p>

<p>The issue I want to avoid is people submitting a useful comment that <em>should</em> cause the work group to revisit an issue, but because the comment is made on something closed, no one reads it or does anything with it.  The only time you can expect a work group to look at comments on a Jira item is if they're "open".</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="222054">@Gino Canessa</span> It's possible for 'managers' to comment on 'resolved - change required'.  So if you're someone involved in actually making the changes/fine tuning what's to be done, you can make comments.  However, you're past the point of making a decision <em>to</em> implement the change, so someone who's just a regular user adding a comment is potentially problematic.  If you want something revisited, you need a new issue.</p>

<p>Agree it's complex.  I've tried to document reasonably well in Confluence, though I'm sure I haven't captured every nuance.  The intention is that you shouldn't have to read all the documentation - you just do what the system allows you to do.  If you can't submit a comment and there's something you want to say, then you need to submit a new issue.  You can reference the original issue in a your descriptive comment.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Correct. Though I'd say it like: you can't force people to actually read and act on comments; it's a fiction to imagine that some complicated matrix of Jira settings can ensure this. So, better to let people express themselves where/how they see fit, and provide <em>guidance</em> (rather than hard constraints) on top.</p>

<p>There's no mechanism to provide guidance - at least not that I have any hope people will read.  My intention here is that the mechanism they might ideally want to follow (just throw a comment on the item) isn't available, and it's something they think is important, they'll try to find some other way to raise it (Zulip, new issue, send an email, raise on a call, etc.).  If we let them raise the comment where it'll get ignored, then the feedback vanishes and we never fix the problem.  (And the user feels like we're ignoring their feedback.)</p>

<p>A Jira is not the whole topic concept, it's just one discussion about it. When that reaches a conclusion it doesn't mean the entire concept/subject is closed for comment, only this discussion strand of it. <br>
I don't see it as a problem to require starting a new Jira to talk about the same thing. The inability to add comments is a good clue. But it is true that some won't get further than that and it's a shame to lose good input. I do think Jira is not primarily for ongoing discussions but for tracking issues to resolution.<br>
I can only think that a note on a closed in Jira to say "Want to talk more about this? Raise a new issue" would help, but there's probably no mechanism for that. <br>
Or could a short version be added as a workflow choice to closed items e.g. "Reopen as new" or "To comment please make a new item"? It may not even need to be functional, it could be just a context specific message, greyed out.</p>

<p>"might not be seen" is too soft.  "Is unlikely to be seen or acted on" is more accurate.  And the question remains what the point would be of allowing that.  I could define a transition that might look promising but wouldn't let the user capture anything but instead would just provide a message telling them what they should do instead.</p>

<p>Looking at the specific use case that started this discussion, I think it brings up a couple of issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is "resolved, will change" the proper end point for the workflow where an issue is closed for comments?</li>
<li>After an issue is resolved, allow the submitter to still make comments (for a limited time?)</li>
</ol>
<p>For the first issue, I think that "resolved, will change" does not indicate the issue is closed. I think this status should be reached with the assignment of the person who will make the change, and the issue is closed when the change is applied. </p>
<p>Once the new "resolved, change applied" status is reached, then only the original submitter, the person who applied the change, and administrators can still make comments - the second point above.</p>

<p>I could open up commenting to everyone rather than just co-chairs and other managers for "resolved - change required" issues on the premise that at least one person from the work group should be looking at the comments (the person who applies the change).  However, the reality is that for 'simple' changes, quite often the person applying the changes will just look at the resolution and ignore all the discussion.  They'll often only look at discussion where the resolution isn't clear or things are complicated.  That's why I limited commenting to only managers, on the presumption they'd have a decent sense of when comments were going to be looked at, and more importantly, that the person applying the changes themselves would be able to comment on the issue.</p>
<p>I don't think we can reasonably force people applying changes to look at the comments, meaning that regular users who make comments are at risk of having them ignored.  Are we comfortable with that?</p>

<p>So it's a narrow time window there possibly. And I think it would often go unnoticed. Once something is resolved I make the change, load the Jira and hit "applied". I don't do a scan over the comments. I am not sure at what point we anticipate more comment. This doesn't seem to help all that much.</p>

<p>I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191651">@Rik Smithies</span> I don't go back and look at comments.  If someone is interested enough in an issue, they shouldn't be waiting until there is a decision made by the WG to comment.  They should have been participating in the discussion to influence the discussion.  I think a new issue should be added rather than allowing commenting on issues that have been resolved (based on the discussion and information available at the time).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think there's a misunderstanding -- the submitter creates an issuer; then hears nothing for weeks or months; then gets a notification email that the issue has been "resolved". At this point, they click through and want to leave a comment expressing anything from a "thank you" to an "I understand but disagree", etc.</p>

<p>During that time nothing may be happening. Which is not a Jira issue. But if stuff is happening that they need to hear about they can "request in-person" so that the issue wont be discussed on a call without them being there. There are other channels that they can choose to monitor, where discussion may happen, but if they request "in person" they should get all the information. Commenting after the resolution is the hard part. "Thank you" is a nice to have. But "disagree", is too late by then. Re-open needs to be the step, it just needs to be obvious.</p>

<p>Often nothing has been happening because the submitter hasn't responded to emails or updates to Jira to get more information - at least that is the experience from Pharmacy.  They submit the request without sufficient information and then don't respond to a request for more information or to attend a call to discuss.  At some point the WG has to make a decision.  Then they don't like the decision.  I think if we allow commenting on the issues that are "resolved" or "applied" will set expectations that the decision may change.  I think if they really disagree with the change, then they should submit a new issue with sufficient information to guide the decision.</p>

<p>I don't have strong feelings about this issue but I'm sympathetic to the point of view that a JIRA ticket is a procedural way of forcing a WG to take action, and a comment on a closed issue does not force any action - so for any feedback other than "thank you" it would always be preferable to open a new ticket.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> If the need for 'expressing' is just personal to let off steam, there's no need for that to be supported through the tool.  If the intention of the 'expressing' is so that their opinion is heard and understood, then commenting on a closed issue won't achieve that.  However, what I'm hearing is that there's a need for a clear option that will allow that opinion to be heard.</p>
<p>So, my proposal would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>on "Resolved - change required", add a new workflow option called "Please revisit" that would change the "Resolved - change required" status to a "revisit requested" status.  Making the transition would require a mandatory comment, with a prompt telling the user that they need to provide information or a viewpoint that was not represented as part of the original discussion on the issue (as represented in the text and comments of the issue and/or associated Zulip thread).  Once in that state, a work group can vote to either re-open the issue (changing it back to triaged) or choose to not re-open, causing the status to go back to "Resolved - change required"</li>
<li>on all 'final' statuses (deferred, resolved - no change, duplicate, applied, published) add a new workflow called "Create linked issue" that generates a new change request referencing the current issue with a link to the original.  (I'm not positive that I can do this, as it's not really a 'transition', but I'll at least investigate.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Would those changes meet the identified need?</p>

<p>I don't object, but question the need for the first bullet. Objecting about a - presumably successful - resolution, in the time between the resolution and the change being applied, seems a very small subset of this. No harm in it, but I don't think it adds much.</p>

<p>Someday I'll clean up that diagram.  However the workflow maintenance process (which uses source control) doesn't give any ability to maintain the diagram (which apparently isn't importable), so every time we import an updated workflow, it trashes the diagram.</p>
