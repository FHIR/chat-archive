<p>Is it appropriate for a FHIR Resource to enrich (update) the display value of references at read time?</p>
<p>For example if Observation.performer references a Practitioner and my client UI only wishes to display the name of the referenced Practitioner, can the service returned an updated value for display to ensure that the correct name is displayed (in case of typos, marriage, divorce etc since the original Observation was created).</p>
<p>I would like to do this to save bandwidth for mobile devices, so don't want to _include a potentially large number of Practitioner resource. It also has the advantage that if no appropriate Practitioner resource is available the client will still work unchanged just by dealing with the display value.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191961">@Rowan Foster</span> This would get messy if there were signatures involved.  And not returning the same content each time could be confusing to some.  But there's nothing that says you <em>can't</em> do this.</p>

<p>This is a nice reminder to all that its always good to include the display names in references, makes things easier to use.<br>
Support staff don't need to go lookup the value to know who the observation was for when cross referencing things (easier to remember Dr Smith than a Guid which could be in the ID)</p>
