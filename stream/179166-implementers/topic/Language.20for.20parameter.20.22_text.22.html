<p>Hi, is there a way to specify the language in which the "_text" parameter for searching is given? This would be helpful, if one wants to search a for a code in a CodeSystem but only in a specific language. Also, it would be very helpful, if the search algorithm is not just a full text search but a more intelligent algorithm that is based on NLP things like stemming.<br>
I don't want to use the "displayLanguage" parameter here because this should specify the output...<br>
Thanks!</p>

<p>For CodeSystem $find-matches could be used -  this wouln't work for ValueSet, though</p>

<p>If you were searching by language (e.g. French), what situations would you <em>not</em> want a match if the string you were searching by happened to declare itself to be English?  It seems pretty unusual that you would find a string match in a different language and the meaning would <em>not</em> be what you were looking for?  Is that situation common enough to justify adding the complexity of the new search feature?</p>
<p>The 'standard' search parameters are defined based on what we believe most systems currently do/can reasonably do.  You're free to define custom search parameters that have different behavior - but you'd have to negotiate to get other clients or servers to support them.  (In practice, not all servers even support the 'standard' search parameters...)</p>

<p>In the operation "find-matches" you clearly might want to <em>interpret</em> an input string to find a matching code. This interpretation needs the language for different reasons: 1.) shortcut expansion (DM means something completely different in German, English, French and so on) 2.) tokenization/stemming 3.) disambiguation 4.) there are words in different languages that are spelled similiar but have a different meaning 5.) spelling correction (it would be nice if a German word would be corrected to a German one and not to an English one - it's even the case that a misspelled word in one language is a correct one in another - "bruch" is in German correct in English you might expect "brush") 6.) word completion (see 5) and last not least a full text search with patterns (a pattern like "ans*" would result in different expansions in different languages. <br>
 The documentation of FHIR even suggest to use implementations like Lucene/Solr for searching (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/search.html#text" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/search.html#text">http://hl7.org/fhir/search.html#text</a>) which is a sample for a semantic search.</p>

<p>I would think that the Accept-Language header would be the basis for the decision?</p>

<p>Thanks - this is definitely a feasable solution!</p>
