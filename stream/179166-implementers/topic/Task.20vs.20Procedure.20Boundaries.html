<p>Seeking feedback on how systems differentiate between Task vs Procedure, so we can beef up the boundaries section of these resources.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>:  This topic surfaced when a question was raised whether to use Task or Procedure to represent medication reconciliation was completed. DaVinci landed on using Task due to it being more administrative in nature.  However, please note that Procedure recently expanded its scope to include activities performed ON, WITH, or FOR a patient to accommodate long term services (such as installing a wheel chair ramp, flashing doorbell, transportation, or walking the dog).</p>

<p>Task is intended for a few things:<br>
- checklist items where you've got a hierarchy of steps to be performed (possibly assigned to different people)<br>
- asking for things to be done to a record/tracking things done to a record (e.g. "please suspend", "please cancel", "please fulfill"<br>
- tracking the details of the fulfillment process (e.g. "has the specimen been drawn?  the blood centrifuged?  preliminary results recorded?  waiting on sign-off?")</p>

<p>However, it would be useful to know what sorts of divisions of records actually exist in real systems - is there a boundary between where you capture information about surgeries, physio therapy and training from where you track "Dr. X would like this prescription to be suspended"?</p>

<p>Task is an intent, where as procedure is an event record (technically, those are the act.mood mappings). Doesn't that define a very big differentiation?</p>

<p>It tracks the execution through to completion.  A Task can be "in progress".  A ServiceRequest can't - the ServiceRequest can only be active - i.e. an active authorization.</p>

<p>Proper RIM mappings on this are going to be a real pain.  The set of statuses probably cover at least 3 different acts and I don't really know how to express that within the mapping syntax we have.  We do have mappings to both the Request and Event patterns.</p>

<p>Here is what I have summarized from this stream and would like to add to the boundaries section of Task:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Task spans both intent and event and tracks the execution through to completion.  Task is intended for "administrative" actions like requesting and tracking things to be done to a record, or keeping track of a checklist of steps to be performed as part of a fulfilment process.  In contrast to Task,  Procedure is an event record and is more about actions that result in changes to a patient. and ServiceRequest  is a record of a request for a service to be performed that would result in a procedure.</p>

<p>On Task, last sentence, change "and ServiceRequest..." to "ServiceRequest is a record of a proposal/plan or order for a service to be performed that would result in a Procedure, Observation, DiagnosticReport, ImagingStudy or similar resource."
