<p>We are looking at capturing Adverse Events across our Healthcare Enterprise.  Can anyone speak to whether the Resource will make it into R4?  Are people using it for STU3?  Does it meet your needs?  It looks fine to me, just don;t want to lose it...<br>
Thank, Radu</p>

<p>AdverseEvent will almost certainly be part of R4.  If it were withdrawn, it would likely be because the need had been met by another resource.  The real question is what maturity it will have.  I hope the WG will deem it production-ready and thus it'll be at least maturity level 1.  Whether it goes any higher than that depends, in part, on engagement from the implementer community.</p>

<p>Thanks Lloyd.  We definitely plan to make extensive use here at Fresenius, for our 1M+ patients.</p>
