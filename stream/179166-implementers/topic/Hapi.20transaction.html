<p>I'm creating a JPA server that follows the format of the example JPA server on HAPI. I can get it all booted up (using MySQL 5.x) and everything seems to work fine. However, I noticed that when I post a Bundle with type transaction and it fails, resources are still persisted in the database. Is this a known bug, or some kind of configuration/resource misuse by me? I expect that if the Bundle post fails, all resources that would have posted even before the failure would not persist in the database.</p>
