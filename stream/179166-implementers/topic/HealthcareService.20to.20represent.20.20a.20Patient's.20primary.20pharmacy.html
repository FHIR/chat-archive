<p>I am trying to represent a list of pharmacies that a patient prefers to obtain the medications from. It appears that the HealthcareService resource is best suited for this. I am struggling with how to associate the HealthcareService with the Patient. Our client would like to GET a single patient, and see the pharmacy list in the same API call. Would an extension on the Patient be the best way to include this? Can I use an extension that would include a list of HealthcareService resources? Any help on how to define this or an example of what the "Patient with HealthcareServices" would look like would be greatly helpful. Thank you!</p>

<p>I would have thought it would be a care team resource and link in the pharmacy organization, and role of pharmacy.</p>
