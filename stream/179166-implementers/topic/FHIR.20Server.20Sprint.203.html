<p>Hi all,<br>
Abigail here from the Clinical Meteor project.  Looking for some advice on how to proceed with our FHIR server implementation. </p>
<p>Here's the status:  We just finished up Sprint 2 for our Meteor FHIR server and client last month, but haven't been able to test them against external systems.  We're looking at starting sprint 3, but would like to validate sprint 2 first.  We also have startups from the Meteor community lining up and asking to use FHIR to connect to external systems.  </p>
<p>As an open-source initiative, we've been slow to find the resources to implement the OAuth server, but have been able to rally other resources, such as an SDK for building apps and a GUI for our server.  We haven't been able to get to Sprints 3 through 7, in part because we don't run a hospital and don't have medication and vitals data.  On the other hand, we've published 18 FHIR resources (with more on the way), and have apps ranging from medical device controllers to clinical dictation, and paratransit dispatch to patient questionnaires.  We don't have a corporation backing us, but we have a small ecosystem of startups using FHIR to build apps.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here?  Any advice on how we should proceed?  We're ready to do interface testing, and start hydrating apps.  But we're really behind the argonaut sprints in some areas, and further ahead in others.  Help?  We're ready for the next phase of development, but need some help initiating conversations and getting our small community of startups connecting to FHIR sandboxes provided by the argonaut project.</p>
<p>Any advice or input would be much appreciated,<br>
Abigail<br>
Clinical Meteor Project </p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191678">@Abigail Watson</span>, and welcome! For Argonaut specific discussion let me suggest the <a href="#narrow/stream/argonaut" title="#narrow/stream/argonaut"><code>argonaut</code></a> stream (which you can join by clicking the gear to the right of "streams" in the left-hand side panel)</p>
