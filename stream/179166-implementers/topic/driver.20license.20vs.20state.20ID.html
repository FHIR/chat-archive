<p>The Value Set <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/identifier-type" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/identifier-type">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/identifier-type</a> lists driver license as one of the entries.  Some people don't have a driver license but have a state ID. A state ID might be given to a person who isn't of driving age, or maybe for an elderly person who is no longer allowed to drive, or someone who needs an ID for identification purposes and never learned to drive. So is the list missing an entry for state ID, or should driver license be considered broad enough to cover?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="195284">@Jack Wallace</span> This is common in multiple countries to have an ID card option for those who don't have a drivers license. I think this should be a separate identifier, and therefore type, not to be mixed in with drivers licenses issued by the same territory.</p>

<p>Not sure I follow the  driver's license thing  but the national ( /state) ID card number is the primary identifier of a person in most EU countries along with the insurance id / national health coverage id. I don't recall anyone asking for a driver's license number around here.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span>   I expect that is because everyone has a national or state ID. In the US and other countries they often don't have a state or national ID so the drivers license in used in place of that.</p>

<p>Indeed. I just noted that "state ID" seemed like a second choice - around here is the opposite, and I did not see a state ID in the value set.</p>

<p>Just for scope, I personally have 6 state IDs: <br>
For each of 2 countries (residence and birth), I have <br>
1 National ID + 1 Social Beneficiary Number + 1 Tax Number</p>

<p>Understood. It is often useful to have 'picture ID' and in North America where, especially in the US, most people don't have passports, a 'government issued' ID with your picture and birthdate is useful for flying, crossing borders, purchasing alcohol etc. So the drivers license works and when you don't have one you can get an ID card from the same body which is just used for identification purposes.<br>
We all have Social Insurance Numbers, your Social Beneficiary Number, but you only want to give that out in real 'need to know' situations and it doesn't serve to prove your identity or age.</p>

<p>Yes, the list should also, I have'd checked, include Known Traveller Number, Passport Number, Border ID, Visa ID, State ID (but you will need to follow the system to know the organization-jurisdiction of the border/visa/state etc. ID.</p>

<p>Not sure if this adds any clarity, or just muddies it up more.</p>
<p>But from what has been explained to me by reps of a couple of U.S. state Medicaid agencies, they sometimes refer to the state-assigned Medicaid number as "state ID". They also say the Social Beneficiary Number code value is really a better match to the state Medicaid number while the general purpose term "state ID" is probably best defined as the U.S. state-supplied equivalent of a driver license for those that don't drive.</p>

<p>The names of these state-issued identification cards will vary a lot. The Queensland (Australia) card is issued by the department of transport (who issue driver licenses) as is called an "Adult Proof of Age Card".</p>

<p>What problem are we trying to solve now? Each drivers license issuer has their own issuing authority identifier, so they are all unique and one can tell who the authority is.   These authorities can be known within a region by systems that care about treating them in a special way. For those not known, they can be treated as general unique identifiers.  So I am unclear what problem is left to solve.</p>

<p>As far as what we are trying to solve, per the original posting the Value Set <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/identifier-type" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/identifier-type">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/identifier-type</a> lists driver license as one of the entries. Some people don't have a driver license but have a state ID. So what identifier type should be used for people who have some form of "state ID" that isn't a driver's license? Should we use the identifier type for "driver license"?</p>
