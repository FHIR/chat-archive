<p>My understanding is that the DocumentReference resource should be able to return meta data about several different types of files (PDF, CDA, Image files, etc.) However, the 21st Century Cures Act says (page 382):</p>
<p>"We note that in the Proposed Rule we proposed in 84 FR 7480 that the clinical note text included in the “DocumentReference” resource would need to be represented in its “raw” text form, and further proposed in 84 FR 7480 that it would be unacceptable for the note text to be converted to another file or format (e.g., .docx, PDF) when it is provided as part of an API response. We clarify that the clinical note text included in any of the notes described in the “Clinical Notes Guidance” section of the US Core IG adopted in § 170.215(a)(2) must be represented in a “plain text” form, and would be unacceptable for the note text to be converted to another file or format (e.g., .docx, PDF) when it is provided as part of an API response."</p>
<p>Does this mean that the response for all clinical notes should not include meta data that points to a PDF or some other file format???  (That just doesn't make sense.) Or is this just a statement to say do not convert the text into a file before sending?  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.</p>
