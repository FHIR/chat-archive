<p>What is the purpose of the fullUrl in the context of a Bundle collection/transaction?</p>
<p>Also does a Bundle of type "collection" mean that the Bundle is created as is  when sent to a FHIR server and individual resources are not persisted? As in, I can only reference the bundle and not individual resources?</p>

<p>The only Bundle types that create an expectation for the contents of a Bundle being broken out into separate resource endpoints are batch and transaction.  For document and bundle, the general expectation is to store the bundle "as is", though breaking resources out as well is permitted.  For message, behavior is driven by the event code (and the type of recipient).  For query response, behavior is undefined.</p>
<p>The fullUrl makes resolving references within the context of the Bundle much easier</p>
