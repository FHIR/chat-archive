<p>Hello, I am a newbie in FHIR. I am going to test the Interoperability between my system (existing) and a system which store stroke data (which is I am going to build).</p>

<p>If you run into specific issues with your development, you can get questions answered here, but you're unlikely to get step-by-step guidance on how to build a completely new system.  You'll need to read through the FHIR spec, look at what your existing system can do, figure out how to map the data you want to share to FHIR, examine the possible exchange mechanisms with FHIR and choose one, then build and test the system.</p>
