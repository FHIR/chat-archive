<p>Hi, I use resource Composition  in STU3 where subject and author are required. In my case I would need the possibility to do not specify a subject or an author. What would be the best way to implement this? I can`t change cardinalities of HL7 resources. Maybe create a new DomainResource?</p>

<p>Hmm, it would interesting to hear your use case, not having a subject nor an author sounds rather strange to me. But if you have such a use case, this may either lead to a change in Composition, or you could consider using a Basic resource and extend that with your own complex extension(s).</p>

<p>If your intention is to create a document, you have no choice but to use Composition.  I tend to agree that author and subject shouldn't be mandatory.  Knowing your use-case would be helpful.  In the interim, you can satisfy the subject and author requirements by just sending Reference.display with something like "Not applicable", but the long-term solution is certainly to get the constraints relaxed.</p>
