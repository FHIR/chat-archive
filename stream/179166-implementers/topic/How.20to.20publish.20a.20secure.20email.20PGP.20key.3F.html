<p>We are configuring HealthcareServices for eReferral to be able to receive referrals via secure email. <br>
We see that the HealthcareService.referralMethod has "semail" as an option. To send secure email, we want to publish the public PGP key of the service. </p>
<p>We are thinking of thinking of three options to do this:<br>
1) create an extension in HealthcareService (called something like semailPGPKey) to store the key<br>
2) create an extension in the HealthcareSerivces Endpoint resource to store the key<br>
3) put the key into the HealthcareService's Endpoint.header</p>
<p>Any thoughts on the best approach to this? Are there other good options I've missed?</p>

<p>Originally we had the public key in the resource, however then needed to know why it was there, and purposes and types and ...<br>
So we removed it so that you can put in the extension for the specific usage that you need.</p>

<p>Ok, i THOUGHT I saw it somewhere previously and when I went looking for it and didn't see it I thought I was losing my mind a little bit ;)<br>
Makes sense for it to be an extension.</p>
