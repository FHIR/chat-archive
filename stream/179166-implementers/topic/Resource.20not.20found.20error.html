<p>If I upload a transaction Bundle and there is a resource that references a resource that is SUPPOSED to exist on the server (but does not - perhaps deleted out of band) what can I consistently expect as a response so that I KNOW that it is a referenced resource not found error? Can I rely on an OperationsOutcome resource? </p>
<p>I am not quite sure how to read the levels in the IssueType codes. Does level 0 mean that is the coarse overview for all the codes with level 1 under it? Does level 2 mean a subset of a level 1 code? What would I expect for a resource not found error?</p>
<p>Could it be 'processing' (level 0)<br>
or<br>
'not-found' (level 1 under processing)<br>
or<br>
'deleted' (level 2 under 'not-found'?</p>

<p>Systems aren't required to check that references resolved when processing a transaction if the reference isn't to something within the Bundle.  If it <em>did</em> fail, you can't necessarily count on a consistent error code.  Different software may detect the issue in different ways.  For some, it may trigger an internal null-pointer error or some other internal failure that may be completely unclear as to cause.  Ideally, the error could SHOULD be not-found or deleted.  But it might be business-rule, exception, processing, transient or maybe something else.</p>

<p>Systems are free to indicate that something has been deleted, but don't have to</p>
