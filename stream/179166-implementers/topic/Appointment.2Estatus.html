<p>You can't. This is a required value set. If you need additional / more refined concepts, feel free to add an extension that uses your own value set. But you will always have to populate Appointment.status, and you have to do so with one of the predefined status codes. If you feel you're using a status code that is likely to be also be useful by others [and not just in your specific context], please feel free to issue a change request (see link at the bottom of each page in the FHIR documentation).</p>

<p>Yes, we expect that your more specific statuses will fit within the scope of one of the existing ones. If not, please let us know what your status is so can be considered.<br>
This approach then let's systems thatbdont know your specific codes at least will be able to accurately group it with the others.</p>
