<p>The fhir documentation for Task defines</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>owner</strong> = <em>Individual organization or Device currently responsible for task execution (which might also be a reference to Practitioner, PractitionerRole, CareTeam, HealthcareService, Patient or RelatedPerson)</em></li>
<li><strong>restriction/recipient</strong> = <em>For requests that are targeted to more than on potential recipient/target, for whom is fulfillment sought (which might be a reference to Patient, Practitioner, RelatedPerson, Group, Organization)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There could only be one single owner but an unlimited set of recipients.</p>
<p>What exactly is the difference between owner and recipient? </p>
<p>Does it mean that if I want a dedicated person (or group of persons) to perform the task I need to reference it in re-striction/recipient? <br>
And does it mean that if more than one person are needed to perform the task the owner would change during the life cycle of the task and only represent the one(s) that are currently working on the task (e.g. in the beginning the owner of the task is the CareTeam and when a member of the care team picks the task from the list it is assigned to this single Practitioner)?</p>

<p>The owner is who is to perform the action in Task.code.  The recipient is a restriction on who should have the Task performed on/for them.  Restrictions are only relevant when a Task is seeking fulfillment of a Request and the fulfillment sought is "partial" fulfillment.  For example, if a Request authorizes medication for a whole family, a Task could seek dispensing for one family member.</p>
