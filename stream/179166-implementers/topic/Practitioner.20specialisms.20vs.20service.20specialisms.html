<p>In the UK GP'es are being asked steadily to shoulder specialisms prior to hospitals. Thus GP'es are referring to GP'es etc.  As such a question which may be asked is "find me all the GP practices in Bradford which have a Dermatology specialist(ism)" </p>
<p>It strikes me that a specialism for a GP "belongs" to the Practitioner as it will move if he/she does. </p>
<p>The only place I can see for this atm would be in "qualification" but this is a higher level i.e. I am just looking for a gp with a 2ndary specialism as a dermatologist vs having to look through qualifications which may or may not have been filled in etc.  So..... where do specialisms belong? at the practitioner level (&amp; if so where) or the service level (&amp; if so where)?</p>

<p>Unfortunately it's not that simple.<br>
Just because someone has a radiology qualification, does not mean they are doing that everywhere they work. They kinda need the equipment to do it.<br>
And also needs a current registration with the appropriate board etc.<br>
Which brings us back to the PractitionerRole resource, which also includes the details of their availability at that location too, which is typically the next step.<br>
You can use the _has search parameter to find the practitioners that have the specialty available somewhere, then use the pracrole to get the specific one.</p>

<p>In DSTU2, you can get specialty from Practitioner.practitionerRole.specialty.<br>
In STU3 and above, you can get specialty from PractitionerRole.specialty and reference to practitioner using PractitionerRole.practitioner</p>
