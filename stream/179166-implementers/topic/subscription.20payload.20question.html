<p>I want to do a subscription so the the criteria is on type Slot but the notification payload to be type Schedule ( that the Slot references)  i.e. the server looks for changes in resource type A but send a notfication containing a related resource type B.   Does this make sense and if so is it a common enough pattern to warrant a tracker?  On my reading of the resource the notification payload is the same a the resources used to trigger the notification ( criteria )</p>

<p>A subscription is a special form of a query. The query parameters (in general) could be about anything, they need not be just related to the resource type returned. FHIR, given its focus on a resource, is a bit more limited, but allows for chaining of parameters over multiple resource. <br>
 Are you sure your query can't be expressed as a chained query, as in (loosely phrased) "give me all schedules where slot.criteria = ??"</p>
