<p>We need an attribute in the Appointment resource where I can put the date and time at which the patient is supposed to be present</p>
<p>In the resource Appointment we have the attributes "start", "end", "minutesDuration" en "requestedPeriod"</p>
<p>Suppose an appointment exists on 15-11-2021 from 10:00 till 11:00<br>
The patient is supposed to be present at 9:45<br>
Notice : the schedule for the participating employee is only blocked from 10:00 till 11:00</p>
<p>Could you please give advise of which filling does make sense most for above mentioned attributes?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Piotr</p>

<p>Typically this would go in patientInstruction as there isn't an obvious value for it to be a discrete/computable value.  If you need a discrete/computable value, it would probably need to be an extension.  You could consider proposing it as a standard extension.</p>
