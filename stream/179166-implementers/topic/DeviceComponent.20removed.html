<p>I see that the DeviceComponent resource is removed from the latest version of FHIR. We were leveraging the information in "Devices on FHIR - Point-of-Care Device General Implementation Guide" (<a href="https://simplifier.net/guide/DevicesonFHIR-Point-of-CareDeviceGeneralImplementationGuide/Home" target="_blank" title="https://simplifier.net/guide/DevicesonFHIR-Point-of-CareDeviceGeneralImplementationGuide/Home">https://simplifier.net/guide/DevicesonFHIR-Point-of-CareDeviceGeneralImplementationGuide/Home</a>) to represent vitals coming from a patient monitoring device. This guide mapped the FHIR resources, Device, DeviceComponent and DeviceMetric to the IEEE device model that consists of Medical Device System (MDS), Virutal Medical Device (VMD), Channel and Metric. The IEEE device model components mapping to DeviceComponent can be found at <a href="https://simplifier.net/guide/DevicesonFHIR-Point-of-CareDeviceGeneralImplementationGuide/DeviceComponentProfiles" target="_blank" title="https://simplifier.net/guide/DevicesonFHIR-Point-of-CareDeviceGeneralImplementationGuide/DeviceComponentProfiles">https://simplifier.net/guide/DevicesonFHIR-Point-of-CareDeviceGeneralImplementationGuide/DeviceComponentProfiles</a>. I would like to understand what was the reason for removal of DeviceComponent resource and are there any efforts to map the FHIR resources to the IEEE device model? Any insights on this topic would be very valuable to me. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192295">@Sathish Tiptur</span>, I think that the devices working group decided to merge the DeviceComponent and Device resources into one for R4, because they were quite similar and overlapping. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192176">@Todd Cooper</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192181">@John Rhoads</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192966">@Stefan Karl</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192228">@Brian Reinhold</span> ?</p>

<p>Hi Sathish, as Michel mentioned Device and DeviceComponent have been merged with R4. The updated Point-of-Care Device Implementation Guide can be found here: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/pocd/2018Sep/" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/pocd/2018Sep/">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/pocd/2018Sep/</a> <br>
Medical device components are now represented by Device resources linked together by their parent reference.</p>

<p>I came across this topic during this week too, and noticed the R4 text for Device (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/device.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/device.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/device.html</a>) talks of DeviceComponent, although there is no DeviceComponent resource in that version of the spec</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In FHIR, the "Device" is the "administrative" resource for the device (it does not change much and has manufacturer information etc.), whereas the DeviceComponent and DeviceMetric (which is really a kind of DeviceComponent) [...]</p>

<p>Hi Mikael, this is indeed out of date. There is a tracker item <a href="https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=19650" target="_blank" title="https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=19650">#19650</a>, which needs to be applied.</p>

<p>Expanding on Stefan's statement ...with the parent reference one can still represent the PoCD hierarchy. The nice thing is that PHD now is just like PoCD but without ever having a parent (there is only a single Device resource).</p>

I can give more detail if you want, but basically in R4 the DeviceComponent resource's capabilities got refactored into an enhanced Device resource. DeviceComponent's main design goal was to allow nesting of components of composite devices. The changes in Device allow this to be done with Device. To get the thinking behind this, look at the detailed differences between Device in R3 and R4.@<strong>Sathish Tiptur</strong> @<strong>MichelRutten</strong> That's pretty much the case.
