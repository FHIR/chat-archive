<p>There is an <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179252" href="/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation">#IG creation</a> channel, where issues can be discussed. The Github contributors address the issues according to priorities driven by publication requirements.</p>

<p>Historically, they've been dealt with when one of the committers had time/decided they were high enough priority.  We're trying to move to a process where there's more community vetting, at least for changes that will impact author or reader experience.  That process is just getting off the ground though.  If it's a bug and it's having a significant impact on you, raising it on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179252" href="/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation">#IG creation</a> and waving your hands at Grahame or Mark Iantorno is the best way to accelerate resolution.</p>
