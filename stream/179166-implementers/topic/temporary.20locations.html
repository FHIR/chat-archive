<p>How are folks indicating a temporary location for a patient as part of an encounter. For example, the patient is admitted to a bed in a MedSurg department but is temporarily taken to the Cardiac Cath lab for a procedure. They don't want to do a typical transfer from MedSurg to Cardiac Cath because the patient will be returning to the bed shortly, but they still want to track where the patient is. Encounter.location can repeat, but there is no value in Encounter.location.status to indicate a temporary location nor is there an element in the Encounter.location backbone element to indicate a "temporary" location versus a "long-term" (however that is defined) location. Suggestions?</p>
