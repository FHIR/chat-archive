<p>We currently including intake and output (I&amp;O) within Observation using a custom extension and a category of vital-signs.  We need the ability to filter out the other vital signs and only include the I&amp;Os.  One proposed solution is to search by a list of 20+ LOINC codes but we are afraid we might take a performance hit.  Another proposed solution is to add a "_list=I&amp;O" search to Observation.  Are these our only possible solutions here?  Or are there other search parameters that make more sense?</p>

<p>Searching by the list of LOINC codes (or using code:in a value set) is what the back end server is likely going to need to do regardless.  It's also more standard.  Few systems will recognize _list=I&amp;O.  You could choose to add an additional category code, but you'd still have the challenge of whether other systems could be counted on declaring that category.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, what extension did you need?</p>

<p>Why would you not have a specific Observation.code to capture intake and another to capture output?  That's how I expect most systems would do it.</p>

<p>I am unclear on the use case for using i/o and input in extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this provenance information you are trying to convey without using Provenance?  </li>
<li>The extension name implies 'method' and yet you are ignoring the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-definitions.html#Observation.method"><code>Observation.method</code></a> element. Why?</li>
</ul>

<p>I agree with Lloyd. They are clinical observations collected and recorded separately from vital signs. They would best be represented with a profile directly off of observation resource that is NOT off of the vital signs profile. There a 100s of applicable LOINC codes, so would suggest value set be developed with a binding to at least a subset of these codes AND make it extensible.</p>

<p>When working with a CIS system targeted for Critical Care use the CIS would calculate the I's and the O's separately and use separate SNOMED codes for the Input (Fluid) Total (251852001) and the Output (Fluid) Total. (251841007).   The CIS system had the 'smarts' to total up all the individual measurements to produce these totals and Fluid Balance (251856003); over different time ranges, e.g.  hourly, shift, or daily.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> my understanding of the intent of these extensions was to separate these records from the vital sign records because Observation.category is 'vital-signs' for both record types.  I agree that this is not clean and would prefer removing these custom extensions all together.  No this is not provenance information and I don't know why it was named 'method.'   </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> I don't know why we use 20+ Observation.code values (instead of just two) to represent a variety of intake and output descriptions.  It is likely the original design was unnecessarily complex and we should simplify it (assuming we don't have reliant apps).  I will look into cutting this down to two LOINC (or SNOMED) codes.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="298707">@John Silva</span> that is very clever and is logic I will pass onto our PM for possible inclusion.</p>
<p>Based on the above feedback what Observation.category could we use here instead of vital-signs (since I&amp;O isn't part of the preferred value set <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/valueset-observation-category.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/valueset-observation-category.html</a>)?</p>

<p>Observation.category is 0..*, so you can have multiple categories.  It seems like that might be appropriate here.  Note that you're not limited only to codes from the preferred value set.</p>
