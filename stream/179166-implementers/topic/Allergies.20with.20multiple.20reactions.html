<p>AllergyIntolerance has two different ways to represent multiple reactions to a substance.  You can either have multiple AllergyIntolerance.reactions, each with one manifestation, or one reaction with multiple manifestations.  I think I understand the difference between the two in the spec.  The reactions are the reaction events, so if you have two reactions a year apart, and for some reason you had different symptoms during each reaction event, then you'd return multiple AllergyIntolerance.reactions.  However if a system doesn't really track allergy events on the allergy record itself, then it is likely more appropriate to return a single AllergyIntolerance.reaction with the "reactions" listed as manifestation.  </p>
<p>Epic's implementation of AllergyIntolerance isn't currently event based, so we will return a single AllergyIntolerance.reaction, where multiple symptoms (swelling, rash, etc.) are returned as multiple manifestations on the reaction.</p>
<p>1) Is my understanding as described above correct?<br>
2) I'm curious how folks have actually implemented it.  </p>
<p>We are working on a client to pull Argonaut-compliant (thus DSTU2) allergies, and are wondering how many implementers will actually return multiple reactions, rather than a single reaction with multiple manifestations.  Since we need to map into a non-event based allergy record, we're trying to understand how flexible we really need to be.</p>

<p>I think your understanding is correct</p>

<p>I've been pretty actively involved in the PCWG work and discussions on AllergyIntolerance andI  agree with your understanding.  I think your suggested approach for the "non event based" situation seems reasonable - but I'm not sure about the state of current and planned implementations in this regard, and, as you suggest, others could do it differently.</p>

<p>If reaction is going to mean different things from different systems, it would be useful if we had a documented convention for differentiating them.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191764">@Cooper Thompson</span> can you submit a change request?</p>
