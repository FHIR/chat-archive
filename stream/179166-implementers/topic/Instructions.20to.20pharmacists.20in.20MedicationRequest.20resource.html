<p>Hello, everyone. </p>
<p>I have a question about MedicationRequest resource.</p>
<p>How can I express instructions to pharmacists (dispensers) such as one-dose package dispensing or crushing tablet in a prescription?<br>
I know MedicationRequest.dosageInstruction.additionalInstruction and MedicationRequest.dosageInstruction.patientInstruction are intended for instructions to the patient, not to dispensers.</p>
<p>And when such the instruction is shared among more than two MedicationRequest resources, how can I represent them?<br>
For example, instruction about one-dose package medications for a couple of MedicationRequest resources. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>There isn't an attribute included in MedicationRequest at this point.   It would. be included under medicationRequest.dispenseRequest - which is the element that provides information to the dispenser.   This kind of information would need to be included on each medicationRequest that it applies to.   You could add an extension for now, but I would suggest that you add a change request for the Pharmacy Work Group to consider.  Please make sure you explain your specific use case in the change request.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.<br>
I'll use an extension at present, but I'll consider making a change request, too.</p>
