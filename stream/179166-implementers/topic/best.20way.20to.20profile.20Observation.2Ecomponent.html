<p>I have a situation where I need to represent a compound measurement (such as the x, y, and z components of an acceleration) but the measurement may also have additional content that needs to be represented as components. I want to specify that the measurement components come first but the order of any subsequent components that may or may not be present is not important. For example, the x, y, and z measurement values are first but the 4 additional component entries (such as supplemental types and relative time values) come after but their order is not constrained.</p>

<p>with slicing you can 'order all + open at end'  or "no order + open at end"   nothing in between.  Why do you need it for some and not all ?  I would go one way or the other.</p>

<p>Good practice is to not enforce any particular order where order has no meaning.   (Enforcing order tends to make interoperability harder as if two different recipients require different order, you must craft different instances even though the data flowing is identical.)</p>
