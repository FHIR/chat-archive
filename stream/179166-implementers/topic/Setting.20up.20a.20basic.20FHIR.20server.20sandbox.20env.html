<p>Hello! I'm working on various projects that wrap a FHIR interface around something else; to help API clients work on integration with our FHIR API (without hitting the real, proxied backend), I'd like to run a multi-tenant read/write FHIR server in our sandbox environment that just serves as the stand-in.</p>
<p>Is HAPI FHIR the best candidate for something like this? I do see the JPA-starter project, and some documentation on a DB-partition-based multi-tenancy option:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter</a><br>
<a href="https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/docs/server_jpa_partitioning/partitioning.html">https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/docs/server_jpa_partitioning/partitioning.html</a></p>
<p>This looks fairly possible.</p>
<p>Other suggestions that people have used to fill this kind of role?<br>
Or pitfalls we may run into with hapi-fhir?<br>
Most of my fellow devs don't have deep Java experience, but my expectation is to get this running without 0much customization involved, and we can focus on our core product.</p>
<p>I've been leaning towards OSS (since we'll probably turn off a lot of pieces that we're doing ourselves, like authentication/authorization and message validation).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions!</p>

<p>There is a <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179167" href="/#narrow/stream/179167-hapi">#hapi</a> stream where you can get better answers. There are other server implementations. You can find the "incomplete" list here: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Open+Source+Implementations">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Open+Source+Implementations</a></p>

<p>I suggest the Google Cloud Healthcare API for as many cheap, scalable, zero-configuration FHIR store instances as you could possibly need. #shamelessplug (perhaps not as customizable as you're looking for though)</p>

<p>Thanks — Google does offer quite a bit more than I'd realized! This may not fit with our current need, but we may be able to use it on other upcoming projects.</p>
