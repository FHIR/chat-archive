<p>Team,</p>
<p>We are documenting procedures like cannulation, vascular access placement etc.</p>
<p>we were able to map most of the elements to Procedure resource, But in the actual procedure record there are lot more attributes like </p>
<p>"what is the depth of Accesss"<br>
"fill volume for Arterial/venous lumnen"<br>
"has buttonhole track established during this procedure Y/N?"</p>
<p>which we couldn't map to the Procedure resource and we considered each one as individual observation and we modeled like below</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Procedure ------report----&gt; DiagnosticReport ----result---&gt; Observation(s)
</pre></div>


<p>This is working fine, we just want to validate is this correct and is ths the only way?</p>
<p>We do have few challenges from of this model,</p>
<p>1. when we need to filter or retreive procedures based on the attribute which are part of observation <br>
    ex: get all procedures only with "has_buttonhole = Yes" (which is an observtion)</p>
<p>We were also trying if we can model like below,</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Procedure
Observation ---partOf---&gt; Procedure
</pre></div>


<p>In this case, if we need to filter by Observation, we can retrieve observation with the necessary search param and include the Procedure.</p>
<p>Right not, Observation doesn't have partOf attribute to Procedure, but will this make sense?</p>
<p>Please Advice if we have any other better approach or Are we going to different path?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Vijay</p>

<p>It seems to me that it should be possible to capture observations as components of a procedure without having to do a full report.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191403">@Michelle (Moseman) Miller</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> opinions?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> - is there a component in Procedure to refer Observation other than "partOf".</p>
<p>Procedure.partOf -- the only reason we didn't consider is, the definition says like "this procedure is partOf a larger event" - conceptually this looks like opposite to our scenario where observation was partOf the procedure. </p>
<p>Looking forward for more opinions from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191403">@Michelle (Moseman) Miller</span> .</p>

<p>Actually, you'd link the other way.  Observation.partOf procedure.</p>

<p>right, that should work. right now we don't have Observation.partOf, would this be an extension or is this something already considered adding to the resource.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  I need to understand how we intend to "do a full report" and have carved out some time in New Orleans to discuss that.</p>

<p>A procedure report would presumably be a FHIR document that would include the procedure, a whole bunch of sub-procedures and a whack of Observations and maybe some request resources as proposals and/or a few other things.</p>
