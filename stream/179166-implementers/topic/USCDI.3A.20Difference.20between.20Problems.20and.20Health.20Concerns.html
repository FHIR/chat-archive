<p>Regarding USCDI, can anyone explain the difference between Health Concern and Problem to me? Both in a clinical sense, and also if they should be flagged differently in the Condition resource. </p>
<p>These are separate data elements in USCDI, yet both map to the Condition resource in the US Core to USCDI Guidance page.<br>

<p>Someone in this chat also noted that Epic has two separate API's for these, but are both based on Condition<br>

<p>A Health Concern is any issue that may affect care that isn't necessarily a healthcare specific issue.  That may include SDOH concerns.</p>

<p>Also, something like Pregnancy is a Concern but not necessarily a Problem.</p>

<p>I must have missed that thread from back in June, as I would have chimed in there, but for Epic, our "health concerns" are really just items on the problem list that are tagged as a "health concern".    So that depends on the clinician manually tagging problem list items, which is pretty rare.  </p>
<p>Anything tagged as a "health concern" will also show up as a problem list item, so most folks can probably just use the problem list API.</p>

<p>Note that the CCDS definition of Health Concerns (which carried forward into USCDIv1) didn't refer to the HL7v2 DAM that David pointed to, so I don't think there is necessarily any expectation that USCDI Health Concerns match the HL7v3 DAM definition.  The CCDS/USCDI definition is super generic.</p>

<p>It sounds like a Health Concern is broader, and can include general and even items that are not clinically coded. I have heard that examples can include SDOH items, such as "Transportation difficulties" or "Underinsured". Is that accurate?</p>
<p>However, the guidance page (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html</a>) is mapping Health Concerns to US Core Condition Profile -- this profile requires a Category Code (1... *) and a Condition Code (1...1). </p>
<p>Am I correct that Health Concerns may not necessarily have a Category Code and/or a Condition Code? <br>
If so, should we consider mapping Health Concerns to the general Condition Resource? I'd be happy to submit a JIRA for this change.<br>
If I am incorrect, can someone point me to the codes that we should be using for Health Concerns?</p>
<p>I realize I may be a bit pedantic here, but I'm encountering this in the course of certification with my company's EHR, and I think others are going to encounter the same questions.</p>

<p>Health concerns have a category <code>health-concern</code> and must have a code that specifies what the concern is, otherwise they won't really make much sense</p>

<p>Codes can be icd-10, icd-9 and a good chunk of SNOMED, so will likely exist for most anything (eg <a href="https://phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/http:/phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/ViewCodeSystemConcept.action?oid=2.16.840.1.113883.6.96&amp;code=266934004">https://phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/http:/phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/ViewCodeSystemConcept.action?oid=2.16.840.1.113883.6.96&amp;code=266934004</a>)</p>

<p>..and the binding is extensible, so for things that are not really there you can just make up a code</p>

<p>"make up a code" - If you have an item that doesn't match anything in snomed, I'm sure snomed would like to know about it. And until then if you do make up a code, publish a website that corresponds to your system that defines the code, that way, it might actually be more than a placeholder.</p>
