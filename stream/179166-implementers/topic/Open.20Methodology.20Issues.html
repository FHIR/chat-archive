<p>Over on the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="211987" href="/#narrow/stream/211987-methodology">#methodology</a> channel we are discussing a number of open issues with the way we define the FHIR specification. Our general plan is to discuss them on Zulip, and then, when either we get to some consensus or we're clearly getting nowhere, to dsicuss them on our methodology telecon (5pm Eastern Tuesday). We invite people to participate in the discussions they are interested in:</p>
