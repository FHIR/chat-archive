<p>Q1. I presume that AllergyIntolerance.code should/shall contain the code for the allergy and <strong>not</strong>  the code for the substance i.e. <br>
<code>91937001 |Allergy to seafood (finding)</code><br>
and <strong>not</strong><br>
<code>44027008 |Seafood (substance)</code>. <br>
Is this correct? And how do we handle things like the code for reaction<br>
<code>15920401000119102 |Allergic reaction caused by seafood (disorder)</code>?<br>
or different granularities e.g.<br>
419972009 |Allergy to shrimp (finding)</p>

<p>Q2. What is the reason that reaction.substance is called "substance"? From a reporting perspective, we notice the reactions to products, not to substances. We actually may not know if it's a substance.<br>
example: a child has a reaction when taking a specific amoxicillin product, which contains strawberry syrup. what would be the substance? <br>
I'd say it's amoxicilin because that's as much as we know<br>
Perhaps it is to the amoxicilin, perhaps it is to the strawberry syrup. Or perhaps it is to the maltodextrin in the syrup. <br>
But that would be reflected on the AllergyIntolerance.code as the allergy is investigated, but not in the reaction.</p>

<p>Q1: There is a comprehensive explanation in the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/allergyintolerance-definitions.html#AllergyIntolerance.code">specification</a><br>
Q2: The clearest explanation that I've heard from clinicians is that an allergy is the risk of an adverse reaction if exposed to a substance based on one, or more, previous adverse reactions to that substance. However, I do fully understand that it's often not possible to be certain what the exact substance is if the adverse reaction resulted from exposure to a medication or foodstuff containing multiple ingredients. The seafood example is a favorite of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191487">@Russell Leftwich</span> who regards it as a type of restaurant, rather than an allergen.</p>

<p>Scientifically it is certain that individuals react to a single substance, almost always a protein when it comes to foods, and usually a metabolite when it comes to drugs because drug molecules are too small for your immune system to "see" them until they combine with some tissue protein to create a larger molecule. Penicillin antibiotics, like amoxicillin, are reactive by design.  That's how they kill bacteria.  Inert ingredients, fillers, in oral medications and flavorings are by design non-reactive, non-allergenic substances. The FDA in the US will not approve inert ingredients, colorings or flavors if they can cause an adverse reaction.  There is zero chance they are causing the reaction.  Although there are urban myths about reactions to food colorings and flavorings, there are no documented cases of which can be reproduced (an anecdotal report is not scientific documentation).  <br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191364">@Peter Jordan</span> is correct: seafood is a type of restaurant.  People do have allergic reactions to organisms that live in the water, but it doesn't have to be saltwater or seawater, and it is specific for a particular species  or genus.  The most common is shrimp, and those individuals often react to other crustaceans.  It is caused by a specific protein in crustaceans.  Other people react to mollusks, clams and oysters, etc, due to sensitivity to a different and unrelated protein.  And a few people react to a protein in the muscle of bony fish, salmon, trout, cod, etc.  It is possible to be allergic to all 3 but not very common.  Likely to react to different members of the same genus -- shrimp and crabs for example. <br>
And I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> that it makes little sense that we list the substance and not the reaction, but that is the way we do it.  It should really be both, but no one listens to me except Peter.</p>

<p>Product is not workable.  People do react to a substance in the product, even if I don't particularly like that term.  CDS can't deal with "product" and there are numerous examples of people who had serious reactions to 500 mg amoxicillin when 250 mg amoxicillin was on their allergy list, but that is a different product.</p>

<p>Right. In my understanding, this element should contain "whatever we know triggered the reaction" - more or less granular. If we know that the patient developed a rash after taking this brand of amoxicillin, one may capture that, and not "amoxicillin". Actually I don't think it is about amoxicillin. It can be the clavulanic acid, or the syrup</p>

In 99 + percent of cases it is only one of those substances/ingrdeients that is responsible for an allergy'intolerance reaction.  Other products that are ordered by a prescriber (or chosen by the patient/individual in the case of OTC or foods) may contain the RESPONSIBLE substance/ingredient/component.  <br>
You cannot protect patients/individuals, which is the ultimate intent of this data, by recording "product".

But in terms of scientific knowledge, clavulinic acid has approximately zero chance of causing an adverse reaction and exactly zero chance of causing an immunology reaction, if that is the way you define 'allergy".  The mechanism of adverse reactions is not commonly understood, but for for most such reactions it is established scientific fact. Irrefutable.</p>

<p>I can't conceive a reaction to a prescribed product :) I can imagine that a reaction happens when a patient takes a product, whether it was prescribed or not. In other words, a patient may be prescribed amoxic+ clav acid; they may be dispensed a specific brand; and they may even be allergic to amoxicillin, but what we know is that reaction happened to that product that was ingested.</p>

<p>I don't think this data element should be trying to solve the complexity of product composition and formulation. What we know is that the patient took something (which is physical, not an abstraction). There may be a reasoning process after that to assert what the suspected specific substance is.

<p>My assumption is that AllergyIntolerance.reaction captures the reaction event, not the clinical reasoning process. I'm not dismissing that knowledge, quite the contrary - I am trying to see how to capture the data that triggers that process. <br>
I do think that <em>Product</em> is not good enough, but not because people may have different understandings of what a "product" is. To me it is something that is produced (as in "brought into existence"). And that may not fit the bill.<br>
Agent would be a better term, I think.</p>

<p>So, question from implementers:<br>
Q2: Since AllergyIntolerance.reaction captures the adverse events, which can be reactions to several causative agents (e.g. pharmaceutical products), and assuming that at the time of capture, we do not know which actual substance caused the event (Amocixilin, Clavulanic acid, strawberry, maltodextrose), do we really want to use the word "substance"? Can I not capture the product?<br>
If not, where do I capture that, and why does the text reference "pharmaceutical product" - and what is the meaning of pharmaceutical product in that sentence?</p>

<p>I don't understand this, esp the "prescribing as a step away" part. I don't see what would be a role for prescription in this. Do you mean something like "representing products on generic and even active ingredient levels, so that when capturing adverse reactions, we can actually point to the substance itself"?</p>

<p>At the point that something is an entry in an allergy/intolerance resource someone has made a clinical judgement that there is a future risk of a reaction to a molecular entity (whatever you want to call it) if exposed.  The risk is exposure to that molecular entity, whatever product it is in.  As far as a reaction, it is true that at some point in time there may only be a temporal relationship between administration of a product and some sudden physiologic change that appears to be caused by the administration.  Clinical reasoning is involved in determining whether it is side effect, overdose, allergy/intolerance reaction, wrong route of administration, contaminated 'product, or something else.  in the first 3 cases it is still the so called active ingredient, not the product.  <br>
"substance" has a long history of usage outside of FHIR and outside of data standards.  I have never liked the term, but I don't think changing it in the FHIR spec seems appropriate.</p>

<p>2 conclusions from my side:</p>
<ol>
<li>Q1 is clear, I'll update our documentation</li>
<li>Q2 is less clear now. Should I create a ticket to discuss the use case for allergic reaction to augmentin pediatric? This is really impactful and I think if we need to make it better, then we should do it now. Some people spend many years thinking they have an allergy when they had an allergic reaction to something else and this is not documented clearly. We can't fix that for all of them, but perehaps we can make things right from now on.</li>
<li>I think we should have broader example scenarios in our spec when we want to go normative, to check for functional silos.</li>
</ol>

<p>Doesn't this definition text for <code>AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance</code> make the intent (and the boundaries on that) rather clear (including how it applies in <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span>'s Augmentin Pediatric scenario)?:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Identification of the specific substance (or pharmaceutical product) considered to be responsible for the Adverse Reaction event. Note: the substance for a specific reaction may be different from the substance identified as the cause of the risk, but it must be consistent with it. For instance, it may be a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a composite product that includes the identified substance. It must be clinically safe to only process the 'code' and ignore the 'reaction.substance'. If a receiving system is unable to confirm that AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance falls within the semantic scope of AllergyIntolerance.code, then the receiving system should ignore AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance.</p>
