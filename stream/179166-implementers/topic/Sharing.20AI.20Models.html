<p>I just watched a presentation here at UT in Houston, a bunch of different teams that shared the work trying to predict Sepsis from a clinical data set provided by Cerner. Good and interesting work. One of the teams asked me about whether there's interest in sharing the model outcomes interoperably. Apparently that would mean sharing weighting values for the input variables, along with some information about pre-processing and which AI algorithmic frameworks are being used.</p>
<p>thoughts?</p>

<p>sure. however, the model weight would need some deidentication process such differential privacy</p>

<p>Would be interested in the outcomes. We have about 120 million care records &amp; I have been pondering (once we complete the move to aws) the AI/ML implications &amp; indeed how they could be shared out e.g. to the NHS in general etc. or indeed what form/format such AI driven conclusions would look like (e.g. to help drive Decision support systems (DSS)). e.g. how does the mass of data resolve down to "these symptoms &gt; check for these problems".</p>

<p>I'm definitely interested in this as well. There's been some discussion about sharing models, but the difficulty I've heard raised is that the models tend to be sensitive to local variation in ways that are difficult to characterize. I'd be interested in taking a look at how we might share the models with FHIR. Any examples we could look at?</p>

<p>There are lots of standards out there for ML models... for example, popular Python libraries like TensorFlow and Keras have the ability to output trained models as HDF5 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format</a>). Unless we're talking about resources that essentially refer to files like these, I don't think we should be creating resources to actually encode the models.</p>

<p>It would be great to have a resource for TensorFlow trained models.  Although my suspicion is that these models are going to be all over the place.  TensorFlow is great.  But I feel that any such resource should also be able to support something more trivial like a SimCity or Sims or SimHospital model just as well.  So my inclination would be to treat the resource as mostly an envelope, similar to the <code>Media</code> or <code>Binary</code> resources.  Don't assume too much about the structure of the model right now; let's just provide a resource with some metadata for tracking it, and include the model along in a rider/attachment.</p>

<p>The Library resource could be used for this, you could just encode the model in the content element, and would provide authoring/publishing metadata.</p>

<p>There's also <a href="https://onnx.ai" target="_blank" title="https://onnx.ai">https://onnx.ai</a>, as an open format for models with pretty broad support (see "<a href="https://github.com/onnx/models" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/onnx/models">Model Zoo</a>" as an example of a non-healthcare-specific model collection. I'm in agreement with Jay that FHIR shouldn't be defining generic infrastructure in this space, but should look at integrating with well-supported existing efforts.</p>

<p>or use DocumentReference for models prior to them being worthy of Library.</p>
