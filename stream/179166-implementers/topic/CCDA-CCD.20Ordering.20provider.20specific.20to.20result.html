<p>Hi All,<br>
Checking in the group if someone can guide me for the below question.<br>
Is there a way that one can describe who ordered a lab test while writing a CCD document. <br>
I have checked Results Section (entries required) (V3)--&gt;Result Organizer (V3)</p>
<p>It has below two entries-</p>
<p>Author Participation (optional)<br>
Result Observation (V3) (required)</p>
<p>Result Observation also has Author participation. </p>
<p>But Author is the one who is authoring the results, not the one who has ordered the lab test.</p>
<p>The CDA model provides participant (0...* participations) class but CCD result entry does not refer to or include this. </p>
<p>and ParticipationType codes also do not include any participant which suggests that entity is ordering Provider.</p>
<p>checked the codes in CDA documentation- vocabulary/ParticipationType.htm</p>
<p><strong>Does it mean that as CCD focus is on providing outcomes (like result not order), there is no way to link specific or all results to its orderingProvider?</strong></p>
<p>Appreciate any help.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Aditya Joshi</p>

<p>It's been a long time since I worked CCDA, but as I recall tracking who ordered an item isn't a high priority for most things in a CCDA (it's an interoperable patient chart). You could kind of use the author block, the orderer would author the organizer with no results, then when the results came in another author would be entered (as the lab). This would model it, but I doubt anybody would ever look at a CCDA and thing "this author" must be the orderer. Plus it muddies the chart with empty result organizers if you have a non-compliant patient. If you are trying to exchange data between two known groups, where you could put a custom participationType value that might be an answer. It likely wouldn't be valid for general use, but internal use it'd be ok. Is the binding on the participant type a SHALL? If not then you can put whatever values you like (for general use).</p>

<p>You might want to raise this on the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="229921" href="/#narrow/stream/229921-CDA">#CDA</a> stream - a lot of the CDA folks don't necessarily hang out here.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="335936">@Daniel Venton</span>  for your response and confirming my thoughts that CCD does not have ordering provider information for results. Yes, I agree the use of Author with empty result organizer is not a good and definitely a generic solution.</p>

<p>Sure <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  I could not see #CDA stream while posting this topic, as I haven't subscribed that. I can see it post subscribing CDA stream. I was trying to move this conversation to CDA stream but probably that is not possible (moving one topic to another stream).</p>

<p>Yes, there's no mechanism to move a post.  If someone directs you to post elsewhere, then the only solution is to re-raise the issue in the new stream.  (Generally we discourage posting multiple places simultaneously - so if not directed to post in an alternate place, it's best to give people a chance to respond before asking elsewhere or provide a link in the original thread to the new discussion location so that all discussion happens in one place.</p>
