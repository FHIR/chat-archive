<p>I'm looking at building a method to "poll" a server for newly arrive ServiceRequests. (e.g., requests that arrived at the server in the last hour)</p>
<p>I see a mechanism to search for _lastUpdated through the common parameters, but this isn't quite right if i specifically want NEW referrals, and not old referrals that have been recently updated.</p>
<p>I also see ServiceRequest.authoredon is searchable, but in the description it says "when the request was signed", rather than created. I presume that broadly this means that the creation date could be different than the signed date?</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> i could use AuthoredOn if i say that the authoredOn date can't be BEFORE the date/time that it was submitted to the eReferral server. Is this ok as an approach? Am i missing another approach for finding new resources?</p>

<p>We explored this in Scheduling.  Your options are polling, using _history or fhir sub/pub.</p>

<p>Note that service requests aren't presumed to be actionable just because the exist - they need a tag or to be the focus of a Task before you know that someone's being asked to action them.  (Things can be posted as a FYI, not just because they want you to do them.)  If you use Task, then you can filter on the status of the Task.  If you just use a tag, then authoredOn is your best bet.  It's really about when the Request was transitioned to Active - presumably you don't care about draft requests that aren't yet complete/authorized.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  Ah, so using the task to indicate what I'm polling against, I didn't think of that. That could indeed do the trick. </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span>  Nor did I think of _history, do you mean look for the FIRST instance in a history of a resource?</p>
