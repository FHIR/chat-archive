<p>Hi!<br>
Might be a diffuse question but im stuck so ill give it a try here.</p>
<p>Is it possible to slice attributes using the HL7.Fhir Nuget package in .NET and is there any guides or documentation on how to do this? <br>
I have created a basic 'ActivityDefintion' and want to slice the attribute 'DynamicValue' into "4 slices" and add a 'Code'  to every slice.</p>
<p>This is an example of a ActivityDefintion in C# and what i want to slice. </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>           ActivityDefinition activityDefintion = new ActivityDefinition()
            {
                Version = &quot;1&quot;,
                Name = &quot;ActivityDefintion&quot;,
                Status = PublicationStatus.Active,
                Experimental = true,
                Date = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString(),
                Publisher = &quot;Jakob&quot;,
                Kind = ResourceType.Task,
                ApprovalDate = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString(),
                LastReviewDate = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString(),
                Library = new List&lt;ResourceReference&gt;()
                {

                },
                DynamicValue = new List&lt;ActivityDefinition.DynamicValueComponent&gt;()
                {
                    //I want to slice this
                }
            };
</pre></div>


<p>Im not expecting anyone to just give med the answer in code but hopefully there is some documentation out there iv missed on how to do this , slicing is a bit fresh for me :-).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Jakob - "slicing" is something that is defined in "profiles" (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html</a>) - basically a FHIR definition mechanism for adding additional constraints and validations on top of the FHIR "core" resources.   In the C# implementation, the C# classes are generated from the "core" resources, not from these additional profiles, so there is no reflection of the slicing you might define in a profile in the generated C# classes.   Assuming you want to express your slices "statically", that is.</p>
<p>I could also read your question as being about defining a set of criterion ad-hoc (in code here) and then running them "live" on an instance to group the contents of a list into sub-groups.  This is not possible <em>yet</em> but I am looking for ways for you to do this in code, instead of having to create a profile. This is however still in the early stages.  Ping me if you'd like to know more.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191328">@Ewout Kramer</span>  Thank you for the clarification and fast reply. </p>
<p>I made a profile in Forge where i sliced like this so basically what i wanted to achive was to create an instance of that profile in code, then cast it to JSON to be able to see a preview on how a valid instance of my profile would look like (the slices more specifically).</p>

<p>So, you will not see this in the output - the xml/json format does not indicate in which slice the data goes.   Also, when you parse the data and use the C# model, you will not see the slices.  These slices (for C#) only exist as a concept in a profile, where you can specify additional constraints using slices - so the .NET validator will know while validating using the profile, but there's no trace left of it in either the instance or the POCO model.</p>

<p>Ok. I misunderstood some basics about the slicing. Thank you for the help!</p>
