<p>Hi all,<br>
We are working on Health care project which uses FHIR R4 . can any one help for a little introduction how to start implementing that. Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi there (and probably welcome). <br>
I think a few more details are helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which part are you implementing: a FHIR-server, a client using FHIR, or both? </li>
<li>Do you have any constraints or plans as to other framework, language etc.?</li>
</ul>
<p>I ask because there are already some APIs which might be used, e.g. hapi. The answer where to start might depend on your thoughts and constraints.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply. Here are the details <br>
    . We are looking for both(Client and Server)<br>
    . We are using .net framework</p>

<p>Hi all, <br>
Same question here, I've been involved in a few mappings between v2 and FHIR in both directions earlier, but now we'll start building a new product from scratch. The product consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a FHIR-server part for storage of the data (should be installed on-prem, data storage on a SQL server)</li>
<li>an in-hospital client webapp (for the clinical staff, with both read and write access)</li>
<li>a mobile webapplication for the patients (running in cloud, with server/server access to the FHIR-server, with both read and limited write access).</li>
</ul>
<p>We don't have a real constraint regarding Java / .Net, both are possible.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>There is a <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179171" href="/#narrow/stream/179171-dotnet">#dotnet</a> stream in zulip where you might find further information. Unfortunately I don't work with .net, so I can't help you any further, but I hope some others might help you. </p>
<p>For Java, there is HAPI, and there is also a <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179167" href="/#narrow/stream/179167-hapi">#hapi</a> stream which might be interesting.</p>
<p>Then in general the following links might help you, depending on your knowledge about FHIR (recommendation inside another stream) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please read the 'first time here' section of <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/">http://hl7.org/fhir/</a> , and view videos such as FHIR for Executives (TED-like talk), <a href="https://vimeo.com/112905640">https://vimeo.com/112905640</a> (April 2019), and Introduction to FHIR (general IT audience), <a href="https://vimeo.com/199173771">https://vimeo.com/199173771</a> (June 2016).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general the following stream might help you to understand the different ways of communicating and information gathering, which you correctly started by asking here: <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/community">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/community</a></p>
<p>For further guidance others might be of more help.</p>

<p>You might want to check out Firely. They offer a FHIR .NET API that "is typically used by .NET developers who want to build their own FHIR client, server or add-on and who want to be sure to be FHIR compliant without having to implement the basis and more advanced FHIR features themselves." I have never used it as I am a newbie, but it might be a good starting point for you.</p>

<p>Take a look of this page. It listed FHIR development package for many programming languages:<br>
