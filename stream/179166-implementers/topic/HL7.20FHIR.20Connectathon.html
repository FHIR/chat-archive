<p>Hi All ! I am learning hl7 v2 and FHIR for building EHR independent integration layer to interface with EHRs. In regards to that, I wanted to take your thoughts on attending HL7 FHIR Connectathon in the January Working group meeting in San Antonio.. Has any one attended such connectathon in the past ?</p>

<p>Probably 1/3 of the people on this stream have attended at least one connectathon somewhere.  What are your objectives?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> , my objectives are - 1. Learn FHIR 2. Networking 3. Learn about any potential solutions that translate FHIR and HL7 v2 messages which will allow me to focus on maximum dependency on FHIR based integration layer 4. Learn architecture patterns for hosting of my integration layers (FHIR server) in cloud and /or on-prem hosting  5. Any introductory / educational / certification sessions that speak for HIPAA and HiTrust</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196824">@Nilesh Pagare</span> , for 1. I'd recommend a 1 or 2 day training rather than a connectathon. For 2 - 4 the connectathon is an option but can be rather overwhelming since the connectathon tracks are often at the very front of the development of FHIR itself. A better fit IMO is <a href="https://www.fhirdevdays.com/" target="_blank" title="https://www.fhirdevdays.com/">DevDays</a>. I haven't seen 5. as a separate topic on either - it is more generally applicable than just in the FHIR realm.<br>
That being said I definitely encourage you to go to the connectathon to see the breadth of FHIR and because you can contribute to the standard from your own experience. FHIR is not just a standard, it is also a community and the connectathon is a good place to become a part of it.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194183">@John Silva</span> , this is a great input. I truly appreciate that. I was also wondering if there any solution to provide such adapters within MIRTH that will allow an integration platform that will be pluggable with EHRs enabled with HL7 v2 and/or FHIR API interfaces . Thank you.</p>

<p>I haven't been keeping up with what Mirth offers but I seem to remember that there are some V2 converters available, but it's sparse right now.  Yep, here's what I saw before:   <a href="http://www.mirthcorp.com/community/wiki/display/mirth/HL7+v2.x+to+FHIR+Conversions" target="_blank" title="http://www.mirthcorp.com/community/wiki/display/mirth/HL7+v2.x+to+FHIR+Conversions">http://www.mirthcorp.com/community/wiki/display/mirth/HL7+v2.x+to+FHIR+Conversions</a></p>
