<p>After losing a profile that I started in an implementation guide I am concerned about the correct way to do this (and not lose my work). On a re-do I created and edited the profile outside of the ImplementationGuide Package. Then I added it to the package. When I closed Forge and reopened the implementation guide I see the profile in the Package. However, in order to edit that profile should I load the profile separately and NOT do it from the Package? I can mechanically do either but is the proper way to edit the profile outside the Package?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192228">@Brian Reinhold</span> profiles and implementation guides are separate resources and files on disk. If you create/add a profile as a child of an IG package, then Forge adds a reference to the (external) profile to the package. However you must always save your profile(s) separately. If you open an IG, Forge tries to load all the referenced external profiles (assuming they are available).</p>

<p>Okay, I guess the problem resulted in that I could actually edit the profile so I did. But when I exited the program the only thing that was saved was the guide so the work I did on the profile was lost.</p>
