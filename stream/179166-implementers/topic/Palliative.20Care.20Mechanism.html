<p>What would be the best way to create a mechanism for sharing the status that a patient is ‘flagged as palliative’? Ideally, the mechanism would help support moving around clinical information that supports palliative care.</p>

<p>Maybe associate them with an Encounter with a Procedure with Snomed code 103735009 (Palliative care)?</p>

<p>Flag resource would be an obvious one - it's sort of the "yellow sticky note on the front of the patient folder everyone should see".  The underlying resource could be various things.
