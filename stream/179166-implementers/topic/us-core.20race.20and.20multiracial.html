<p>We are collecting transplant outcomes data from different organizations and part of this effort includes collecting patient demographic data. We are planning on using us-core for this, including the race extension. One transplant center records a value of "multiracial" but that is not in the valueset bound by the extension. We're looking for best practices on collecting this data.</p>
<p>Since the "text" element is required in the extension, we'll ask them to record "multiracial" in there, but we are reluctant to using non-structured data element for downstream analysis. Would it be reasonable to add UNK as a structured field? e.g.,</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>{
    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-race&quot;,
    &quot;extension&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;url&quot;: &quot;ombCategory&quot;,
            &quot;valueCoding&quot;: {
                &quot;system&quot;: &quot;http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor&quot;,
                &quot;code&quot;: &quot;UNK&quot;,
                &quot;display&quot;: &quot;Unknown&quot;
            }
        },
        {
            &quot;url&quot;: &quot;text&quot;,
            &quot;valueString&quot;: &quot;Multiracial&quot;
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre></div>


<p>Has anyone else had to deal with this issue (non-specific multiracial)? How did you deal with it?</p>
<p>And, would it be good practice to create another extension to add "multiracial" to a valueset?</p>

<p>might ask this question on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179190" href="/#narrow/stream/179190-united-states">#united states</a> ? but those value sets are regulatory so additions doesn't seem likely to me. So it would be an extension, like what you have, but with a URL</p>

<p>The extension isn't really targeted at clinical use</p>

<p>The data is/will be used for observational research.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know if others have encountered, solved, or worked around this same issue (a non-specific "multiracial" category).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191926">@Joel Schneider</span> It is my understanding that currently OMB (which is the start-point for the CDC code system) has specifically decided to <strong>not</strong> include a multiracial category. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Revisions-to-the-Standards-for-the-Classification-of-Federal-Data-on-Race-and-Ethnicity-October30-1997.pdf">See:</a><br>
(1) OMB accepts the following recommendations concerning reporting more than one race:<br>
When self-identification is used, a method for reporting more than one race should be adopted.<br>
The method for respondents to report more than one race should take the form of multiple responses to<br>
a single question and not a "multiracial" category.<br>
When a list of races is provided to respondents, the list should not contain a "multiracial" category.<br>
Based on research conducted so far, two recommended forms for the instruction accompanying the multiple response question are "Mark one or more ..." and "Select one or more...."</p>
<p>So it seems that your source data is not compliant with regs. Assuming the actual races that the person could have selected are not known, I think your use of UNK and the text may be the best solution. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191410">@Brett Marquard</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197115">@Steve Posnack</span></p>

<p>As a temporary solution, sure add an extension. Did you ask if they considered using the values required by all EHRs?</p>
