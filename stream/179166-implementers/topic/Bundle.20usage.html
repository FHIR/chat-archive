<p>I want a create/update operation for the notion of a "patient" in our FHIR-enabled system. My "patient" is essentially a FHIR Patient, but with a couple extra data fields. These fields are required at the lowest level, so in my system - I can't create a "patient" without them.</p>
<p>Is it reasonable to make the create/update operation a “transaction” type operation for the Bundle resource – where the Bundle has a Patient entry and other dependent entries (which have the additional fields)?</p>

<p>The contents of a Bundle have to be official resources.  Have you looked at using extensions?</p>

<p>Yeah, the idea is that the entries in the Bundle are official resources. For example, one of the "dependent entries" is a Coverage resource.</p>

<p>You're looking for an external system to request creation of a Patient on your system, but for that to work they also need to send you a Coverage?  I suppose a transaction could work for that.  (But be aware that most systems won't try to work with you that way, so you'll essentially be imposing a customization requirements on everyone that talks to you.)</p>

<p>OK. I think I understand that. Our current implementation is somewhat internal - that is, we have a certain level of authority to impose the requirements. Would imposing such a requirement not be "according to standard"?</p>
