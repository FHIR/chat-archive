An example is if a member wants to search to see what drugs are covered under all the plans.  Based on existing data this would return a very large volume of data.   Pagination has been suggested which will help the requester and the third party application but not the payer as we would still need to return ALL the records.  Our recommendation is to require additional search criteria within the third party app and the Patient Access API.  Medicaid vs Medicare is a parameter that would narrow down the search along with state since many plans are state specific.</p>
<p>Could these be added to the next IG version and provided as guidance to payers and third party apps until that version is published?</p>
