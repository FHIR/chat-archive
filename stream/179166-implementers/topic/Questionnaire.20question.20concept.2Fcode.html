<p>FHIR DSTU2 Questionnaire has the field question.concept and FHIR STU3 has item.code, both are documented in the spec as the concept of the question/item. I have a couple of question regarding this. Firstly, what was the reason for this (what seems like) renaming of a field? Secondly, what is the purpose of the field? Given an example question: "What is your hip pain like?", does the concept/code denote the specific question (i.e. "What is your hip pain like?") or is it supposed to be a more broad concept (type of question) i.e. "Pain question"?</p>

<p>The rename was for greater consistency across resources.  The element is expected to align to the specific question.  It allows you to capture things like the LOINC code that corresponds to a specific question.  It doesn't represent a high-level category - so far, no one's had a use-case for this.</p>
