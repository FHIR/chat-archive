<p>What is the best way to do this type of business query on server. Search information is spread across multiple resources.</p>

<p><code>[base]/Slot?start=2021-08-08&amp;service-type=80|http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/service-type&amp;_has:schedule:actor:location:near={long}|{lat}|5|km</code> where {long} and {lat} are the longitude and latitude for the current location of 'me' and 2021-08-08 is the date for tomorrow.<br>
Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not a given that all servers will support the _has search parameter to that level of depth. </li>
<li>The search will match on both HealthCareService and on Practitioner, but won't match on other types of slot actors</li>
<li>This search presumes the system uses the HL7 example code system for service types, which isn't guaranteed - you may need to use different codes.  (You might also want to include the code for pediatric dentistry if relevant.)</li>
<li>The URL doesn't have the code system URL escaped, which you'll need to do</li>
<li>I haven't actually tested this, so there may be some syntax errors</li>
</ul>

<p>^^ additional caveats: not all scheduling systems model slots this way (service type is the necessarily reflected on the slot; may be a property of slot, schedule, healthcare service, or elsewhere); not all scheduling systems model location this way (could be a property of the schedule or healthcare service or even a practitioner role or elsewhere); not all scheduling systems will support geospatial query modifiers</p>
<p>In short there are so many possible ways to express semantics with this level of complexity (and so many optional pieces that need to be in place) that you shouldn't expect a query like this to work in a reliable interoperable fashion against real software systems. If you're deploying your own system to support this kind of thing, you'll want to document your modeling choices clearly, so clients can follow along.</p>

<p>Thank you <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>  . Genesis of my query is the India's proposed national "Unified Health Interface "  UHI. It is envisioning to enable such services .  <br>
I was exploring if we had to implement similar queries using FHIR how difficult and appropriate it would be.  <br>
Since Consultation paper is out  for feedback and suggestions, I am evaluating the fitment of FHIR APIs in scheme of things. So that we can recommend use of FHIR APIs/services in UHI . </p>
