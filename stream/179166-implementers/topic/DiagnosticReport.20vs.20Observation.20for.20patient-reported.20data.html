<p>How are others modeling imaging results that a patient reports having been completed?<br>
 e.g. "I had a mammogram on 1/1/2018 that was negative." Based on the Boundaries sections and a few previous Zulip threads, we are considering using DiagnosticReport, Observation, or some combination of the two linked through DiagnosticReport.result (in addition to Communication).</p>

<p>The question is where you'd expect it to show up in the EHR.  I doubt most systems would include that sort of information alongside other DiagnosticReports.  You <em>might</em> see it alongside other observations.  Most typically you'd probably see it captured as a "note" - which EHRs are currently planning to represent using DocumentReference.</p>
