<p>Hello, I am working to release our backend application and our EPIC on FHIR specific release is having issues searching patient lists that are in-progress or discharged for the day.  Does anyone have any suggestions for retrieving these lists of encounters?   The EPIC on FHIR specific version seems to have a lot less flexibility in searching and retrieving patient lists. As an additional workaround we were going to utilize the List (PatientLists) endpoint and configure a custom systemlist for retrieving this data.   Preferably I wanted to see if anyone was able to search encounters with relaxed business rules successfully: Any feedback would be appreciated.</p>

<p>have you looked at <a href="#narrow/stream/227046-Argo-Patient.20Lists/topic/Argonaut.20Announcements/near/223443953">Argonaut patient lists project</a> ?</p>

<p>It has come up many times in my research - Is this something that an out-of-the-box epic installation?  We just moved to R4 to have more accessibility to extra endpoints but from what I saw available at <a href="http://fhir.epic.com">fhir.epic.com</a> I saw no options to access argonaut etc...  E.g: The allowed options I receive for backend services at the moment is DSTU2/STU3/R4 and that's assuming the specific hospital activated that offering (most are DSTU2 from what I've seen).  I might need to do some more research to make sure I understand it correctly.</p>

<p>Epic has a pre-Argonaut implementation of Patient lists.  This uses the List resource (please, no discussion on List vs. Group here - we developed List before that whole kerfuffle).  Using Epic's "List" based Patient Lists requires some setup.  The health system must identify which system lists they want a client to have access to.  Because there is configuration required, I don't believe we have a great option for testing this in the sandbox.  You can either join the App Orchard program if you need sandbox testing support, or work with a health system to test your List integration in their TST environments.</p>

<p>We don't support the new Argonaut patient lists stuff for production use.  Yet.</p>

<p>Thank you Cooper for the information it really seems that all roads lead to the List  (Patient List)resource.  I noticed it was not included in the R4 endpoint offering but it is still included in the STU3 offering: trying to balance our existing methodologies for getting our encounter lists and R4 vs STU3 options.  Still looking into HL7 v2</p>

<p>We haven't uplifted our Patient List support to R4 yet.  It's on the TODO list.  For now, I'd suggest just using STU3.  It is common for folks to mix FHIR versions to get everything they need.  </p>
<p>Also, I do try to keep Epic-specific support off of zulip.  <a href="mailto:open@epic.com">open@epic.com</a> will normally be your best resource for Epic-specific support.  I probably undermine that goal by responding on zulip though...</p>

<p>Hahaha, understood I will use that from now on.  Thank you.</p>
