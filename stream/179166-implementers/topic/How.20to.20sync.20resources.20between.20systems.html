<blockquote>
<p>once a resource is deleted, it's considered gone except for _history - so search and subscription don't help. Hence for this reason, you need _history for this one</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is unfortunate, so one actually needs to poll <em>_history</em> to to know if a resource got deleted? Or would a subscription against /Resource be allowed to match that?</p>

<p>yes you need to poll. and no, subscription doesn't work. you can see discussion on this on the subscription channel</p>
