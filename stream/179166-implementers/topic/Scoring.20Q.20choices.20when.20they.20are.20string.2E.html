<p>The Docs state:</p>
<p>"tabulating scores. To help with associating numeric values to coded answers, there are two extensions defined - one for defining the numeric weighting of a code defined in a value set - valueset-ordinalValue and the other for defining a code that can appear within a Coding itself - iso21090-CO-value." </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>but what if you want a plumb simple list of strings as choices - should the extension's  context allow <em>any</em> Q.item.option[x]? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also I don't understand the difference between the two extensions.  Do they accomplish the same thing?  Is one more commonly implemented?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't actually know why we have two extensions.  And I'd expect support for one in CodeSystem too - that's where it would be defined.  So far, no one's asked for an ordinal value for strings</p>

<p>That would be useful for sorting, but I haven't done it.</p>

<p>sorting? I meant a choice of strings ( <em>instead</em> of codings) say.... 'blue' = score 1, and 'red' = score 2.   then at the end you tabulate the score.  which leads to my next question <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/implementers/topic/Q.20scoring.20instructions" target="_blank" title="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/implementers/topic/Q.20scoring.20instructions">here</a></p>
