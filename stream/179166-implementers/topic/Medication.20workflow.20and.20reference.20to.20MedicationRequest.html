<p>I am currently looking into the workflow aspects of FHIR. </p>
<p>Conceptually, an <strong>Event</strong> is <strong>basedOn</strong> a <strong>Request</strong>. This feels like a robust model. </p>
<p>Examples:<br>
<strong>DiagnosticReport.basedOn </strong>   Reference(CarePlan | ImmunizationRecommendation | MedicationRequest | NutritionOrder | ServiceRequest)  What was requested<br>
<strong>Observation.basedOn</strong>     Reference(CarePlan | DeviceRequest | ImmunizationRecommendation | MedicationRequest | NutritionOrder | ServiceRequest)  Fulfills plan, proposal or order<br>
<strong>Procedure.basedOn</strong>   Reference(CarePlan | ServiceRequest)    A request for this procedure<br>
<strong>Encounter.basedOn</strong>       Reference(ServiceRequest)   The ServiceRequest that initiated this encounter<br>
....</p>
<p>But when it comes to Medication events, they do not have <strong>basedOn</strong>, instead they seem to have corresponding elements with different names<br>
<strong>MedicationDispense.authorizingPrescription</strong> Reference(MedicationRequest) Medication order that authorizes the dispense<br>
<strong>MedicationAdministration.request</strong> Reference(MedicationRequest)   Request administration performed against </p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong><br>
Is there a reason why Medication events seem to deviate from the FHIR Workflow standard? The elements listed above for the Medication events seem to correspond to what the basedOn element achieves for other events. Workflow is a complicated area, consistency is nice :) </p>
<p><strong>SUGGESTION</strong><br>
If there is no reason to deviate from the FHIR workflow standard in the medication domain, maybe the Medication event elements should be renamed and called basedOn?</p>

<p><strong>12.5.1.4 Event Resource Pattern </strong><br>
Events are resources that represent the ongoing or completed execution of some activity or observation. For example, a clinical procedure, a financial transaction, the recording of a diagnosis, etc.<strong> An Event pattern defines the common elements typically present on all event resources</strong>.<br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197234">@Martin Grundberg</span>  - thanks for raising this concern.   When I was asking questions here about how V2 Medication (and other) Order workflows fit into FHIR there was a response (or a few -- from the FHIR experts) about the FHIR workflow pattern.  However, it doesn't seem very clear (or well developed/explained) when it comes to the medication workflow.    So, besides the consistency (or not) with the Event Resource pattern, it would be very helpful if the Pharmacy group could work with the FHIR workflow group (or is it really the FHIR experts) to come up with a pictorial view (model) of this pattern that makes it easier to understand and, then, to make sure the Medication-related resources use consistent property names with the FHIR Event pattern?   (BTW, my question/concern was how to reconcile the ORC-1 - Order Control codes with the MedicationRequest.status property and was told that MedReqs are not workflow 'objects' but more of 'current state objects'.  OK, so then I thought that the ORC-5 Order Status would more closely map to the MedReq.status property but that didn't seem a good fit either, though better than ORC-1.  However, the ORC-1 states, which are uses for ALL HL7 V2 order types, do not map 'neatly' into the MedicationRequestStatus value set.)</p>

<p>Alignment with the workflow patterns isn't mandatory - work groups determine what is "typically" supported by systems in their space and also what  element names are going to be most intuitive.  In the case of Medication[x] resources, the work group didn't feel that linking to care plans, ServiceRequests and other types of request resources fell within what most systems did and that the name "basedOn" wasn't sufficiently clear for their community.  However, you should see mappings to basedOn in both resources.</p>

<p>I would still argue though that for long term ease of use for us implementers, following a common pattern across different resource categories is a good idea (hence, I really appreciate the Workflow pattern!). That includes standardizing element names which have the same meaning across resources. You can still add a Description text that explains that element in the context of its specific resource. </p>
<p>But the core support for referencing a MedicationRequest is there in Administration and Dispense, so that is good at least!</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191759">@Melva Peters</span> , how do you report a ticket? And what is the main use case for reporting them? I don't think this will be my last question/issue like this, so maybe those are better posted as tickets then in the implementer stream?</p>

<p>Common names are helpful for those systems that deal with multiple resources, but those are, by definition, more sophisticated than those systems that are pharmacy-specific.  Our approach is to make things as simple as possible for the "simple" systems, even if that means extra complexity for more sophisticated systems.</p>

<p>We have deep experience with what happens when we value consistent naming and modelling over domain intuitiveness.  The result is significantly higher costs and reduced interoperability for everyone.</p>

<p>Someone pointed me at this. I have several questions:<br>
- is there a task around <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194183">@John Silva</span>'s very reasonable request for some summary of the medication workflow? <br>
- is it really true that a medication dispense can only come from a MedicationRequest which establishes the wider context? (e.g. careplan etc) <br>
- I'm not entirely sure that MedicationDispense.authorizingPrescription is actually same as basedOn, but the definitions seem to imply that it is, just renamed. But the relationship between a dispense and it's authorizing prescription is different to (say) the relationship between a DiagnosticReport and the MedicationRequest that made it appropriate</p>
<p>I'm not sure that we're in a happy place here</p>

<p>I'll defer to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191759">@Melva Peters</span> on the first.  For the second, "over the counter" meds aren't captured as dispenses that I've ever seen unless there's a prescription.  AuthorizingPrescription is mapped to basedOn.  Agree that DiagnosticReport being "basedOn" a MedicationRequest seems odd.  I can't think of a situation where a drug prescription would authorize the creation of a DiagnosticReport.  CarePlan and ServiceRequest make sense there.  ImmunizationRequest and NutritionOrder are also suspect.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> ?</p>

<p>OTC meds are captured in a dispense, even if no prescription. Also in some situations, drugs are dispensed that don't have a prescription (yet), so there definitely is a need for dispense record even if there is no prescription.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, in Canada, a pharmacy would only dispense an OTC if there was an order for it.  E.g. If a clinician prescribes Aspirin,  then a pharmacy will dispense it (and you can claim it against your drug insurance).  If you just go into the pharmacy and buy Aspirin, it's not going to be recorded against your record (or if it were, it'd be a MedicationStatement).  Similarly, in an in-patient setting, no pharmacy would dispense Aspirin without an order.  That said, I don't think the resource forces the existence of a MedicationRequest.  It doesn't fall within 'core' to link a dispense to a CarePlan or some other sort of order though.</p>

<p>Well, I agree we need some guidance on workflows :) This was happered flat  in IHE (for V2, not FHIR). The cases were: 1. drug is dispensed but prescription will only be there later (e.g. emergency contraceptives). 2. drug is OTC and we want to capture it. We used the same notion "dispense" because there is no reason this would be any other data object. So IMO if a Pharmacy wants to say "i just delivered this drug to this patient" this is not a medstatement. this is functionally / semantically a dispense.</p>

<p>I am assuming you mean why does DiagnoticRequest have basedOn MedRequest or ImmReqest,   What  about drugs ( like PB) that require testing prior to reauthorization or vaccines that (like rabies) that may require a titre before administration.  That was the rationale behind this.</p>

<p>I feel as though 'basedOn' is pretty loose - certainly by it's definition. At least, I don't feel that authorizingPrescription has the same semantic breadth as basedOn, but the definitions and the answer above imply that it does</p>

<p>Typically if an OTC is "prescribed", then it will go through as a dispense - often it can be claimed on insurance if prescribed - at least in Canada.  If it is not prescribed - patient walks in and wants an antihistamine, then it is recorded as a MedicationUsage.  Typically these are recorded if it is chronic use (Aspirin 81mg) or seasonal use (like yearly antihistamines)</p>

<p>So the flow for 'no prescription' is different depending if the drug is an otc or not...? In other words, if I go to pharmacy and say 'i forgot my antibiotics, but I can bring a prescription tomorrow. And please give me some paracetamol' - in IHE this produces 2 dispenses, one will be needed for reimbursement, the other not. In Canada this would be one dispense and one Usage? How does the system know that the antibiotics prescription will arrive?</p>

<p>I don't agree with the statement that "IHE handles workflow".   In your example above, for something like antibiotics, unless there was an indication of urgent need, the pharmacist would probably say "come back tomorrow".  However, for something like asthma meds, the pharmacy might make an emergency dispense - and would likely record it in the shared record once the prescription had arrived.  In terms of the paracetamol, they'd show you where it was on the shelf and if you wished, ring it through for you, but if they bothered to put it in the record at all, it would be MedicationUsage.  They wouldn't think of it as a dispense and certainly wouldn't record it as one.  The business workflow would be completely different.</p>

<p>"IHE Handles workflow" was the statement in a joint meeting between HL7 and IHE (or perhaps two, can't recall). This was a very reassuring position at the time, because it allowed both parties to focus on what they do best.</p>

<p>The perception of what "dispense" is can change from place to place (not good but that is what we have). FWIW, in my experience, "they wouldn't think of it as being a dispense" is not binding for the system behaviour. The system sees "I have a patient being given medication for them - that is a dispense record"</p>

<p>I concur that there should be guidance . From an IHE side, I previewed how the IHE HMW diagram would be on FHIR.<br>
And HL7 must provide the basic mechanisms - that is what we are doing. So we work in both IHE or HL7 to  provide guidance on workflow.</p>

<p>How the business sees it drives how the system sees it.  The pharmacists don't want it in their dispense records.  And the physicians don't want it in their dispense records.   The only record they care to have is "patient may be on this medication".

<p>You can't enforce orthodoxy if the business domains don't have consistency.  I can tell you that if you tried to tell the pharmacists in Canada to capture an OTC as a dispense, they'd tell you to stuff it.  (And if your argument was that the Europeans do it that way, they'd probably tell you to stuff it further :&gt;)  Technical standards organizations have to work their standards around business practice.  If there's a desire to change business practice, the point of leverage is professional societies, not technical standards.</p>

<p>Yes, that may be the case in some cases, In other cases that info may be relevant - e.g. to continue a workflow. In some cases you want to say "this has been dispensed" (because it was).

<p>I understand that you want it consistent.  But if the business isn't consistent, there's no chance that HL7 (nor IHE) is going to make it so.  If the business has inconsistencies, that will indeed drive technical complexities - but standards organizations can't do much to fix business consistencies.  The resources used are driven by where users want to see the data.  And they don't want to see OTCs mixed in with the stuff relating to orders unless there's actually an order for it.</p>

<p>I would like to study the OTC cases in more detail, and get back to this after some discussion.

<p>I haven't seen any 'need' in the Canadian space for OTCs and prescribed meds to be handled consistently.  In fact, every project I've been involved in, the stakeholders have been quite clear that they want them handled differently.  They don't want them on the same screens.  They don't use the same workflows.  Dispenses of prescriptions are tightly regulated.  They need to be tracked.  There's insurance involved.  With OTCs, the process is the same as if the patient was buying a bag of apples.  The only difference is that, in some cases, there's seen to be value in capturing the medication in the record as "patient is likely taking" because of the possibility of adverse reactions.  The fact that from a <em>modelling</em> perspective, both are clearly dispenses doesn't matter.</p>

<p>I'm not convinced about this, and I'd like wider input. Your argument basically appears to be: in the experience I have, pharmacists don't want non-prescribed things to be be called dispense, so therefore dispenses always are based on prescriptions, and not on other things.

<p>The FHIR Medication Resources need to support the OTC use case, so the modelling perspective does matter. Otherwise, it's not possible to perform medication reconciliation, using those resources, in cases where a patient is taking OTC meds. Noting that the FHIR Spec states ...<br>
<code> A medication statement is not a part of the prescribe-&gt;dispense-&gt;administer sequence but is a report that such a sequence (or at least a part of it) did take place, resulting in a belief that the patient has received a particular medication.</code><br>
Pharmacy systems should be able to differentiate by looking at the requestor in the MedicationRequest that's linked to a MedicationDispense Resource via an authorizingPrescription reference. If they don't regard OTC sales as requests and dispenses, that's their perogative - but that shouldn't prevent other systems, with different requirements, from doing so.</p>

<p>Here's a 'strange case' from the US -- in many pharmacies now there are certain OTC drugs that need to be carefully tracked because these need to be kept from getting in the hands of 'youngsters' or 'abusers'.   So the pharmacist might not care about these but the (US and local) government do and might even require pharmacies to report on the 'dispense' (or purchase - don't care what it's called though for modeling consistency ...)  of these.   </p>
<p>On the discussion of MedDispense vs MedUsage -- why would the pharmacist care when these are used or what they are called as long as it doesn't affect their workflow?   It seems to be a function of the PIS (Pharm Info System) that they are using, not the back-end FHIR data objects, that matter to the pharmacists.   The PIS vendors need to get this right for their own individual markets and the FHIR (or HL7) technology that supports these systems needs to be powerful and flexible enough to support their information and product models.</p>

<p>I'm not saying that dispenses are always based on prescriptions.  (And the model doesn't enforce that.)  I'm saying that supplying of OTC products to a patient typically won't be captured using MedicationDispense.  If you need/want to, it'll certainly serve the purpose.</p>

<p>In Canada, the drug information systems (DIS( have a mechanism to handle medicationUsage.  This is used for medications purchased from a pharmacy where there isn't a prescription or where a patient gets a prescription dispensed from a prescriber in another jurisdiction.  These are recorded on the pharmacy management system and sent to the DIS as "record other medication" (Canadian V3 interaction similar to MedicationUsage).  This is done to make sure the medication profile is complete as possible.  If the drug is prescribed, then it is typically put through as a dispense against the prescription because a claim is generated for dispenses (but not for medicationUsage).  Sometimes the pharmacist may not know how the system is handling the record - some systems trigger the recording of the OTC automatically based on the drug by default.  In Canada, often the jurisdictional Drug Information System where the pharmacist is practicing determines what message is captured for each type of record.  The medication profiles that are returned for all clinicians to view from the DIS returns all types of records - MedRequests (prescriptions), MedDispenses, MedUsage.  There may be different types of business rules on the type of alert checking that is done for each type of record.  For example, in Saskatchewan where I worked, no checking is done when an OTC is added to the profile, but the OTC meds are included in alert checking when a new prescribed medication is added.</p>

<p>why would the pharmacist care when these are used or what they are called as long as it doesn't affect their workflow?   It seems to be a function of the PIS (Pharm Info System) that they are using, not the back-end FHIR data objects, that matter to the pharmacists.   The PIS vendors need to get this right for their own individual markets and the FHIR (or HL7) technology that supports these systems needs to be powerful and flexible enough to support their information and product models.</p>

<p>It feels that statement/usage is too fuzzy. Are we taking about a "statement of dispense" or "statement of presumed usage"? Here is a use case: Patient says "I have been prescribed and dispensed this medication but I did not take it". I don't think statement supports this. I'm not saying it should support this, just to say that Statement is fuzzy enough NOT to be in in the middle of workflow, if the meaning is fuzzy.</p>

That's far more important than a desire for theoretical consistency or model purity.  If users don't want OTC stuff with the other dispenses and <em>do</em> want it with their records of "other drugs a patient may be taking", then that's where it should go.</p>

<p>When a drug is given to a patient, you have a choice of recording a MedicationDispense, a MedicationUsage, both or neither.  When it comes to OTCs, in Canada the most common is "neither" - because the acquisition of the drug happens in a context where: a) there's no incentive to track it; b) the purchaser and the patient are quite likely not the same.  The second most common is MedicationUsage because the only use-cases for tracking it is the useCase MedicationUsage is for - a desire to know "what meds is the patient likely on" - for drug-drug interaction checking.  There's no notion of "compliance" with OTCs because there's nothing to "comply to".  There's no need to monitor supply of the drugs because they're not considered sufficiently risky to manage them as prescription drugs.  The <em>only</em> times OTCs would be tracked formally as a MedicationDispense is if there's insurance involved - which means there has to be a prescription.  And if there's a prescription, the OTC is handled the same as any other prescription medication.</p>
