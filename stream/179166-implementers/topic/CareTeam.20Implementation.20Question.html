<p>During the ONC CareTeam Definition call - the following question came up:  How in FHIR to reflect coverage for a member of the care team when the member is away (or off work)? For example, a provider goes on vacation and his patient is being covered by a coverage group. A member of the coverage group will fill in  for the provider who is away. We see the coverage team filling the same role as the usual member. </p>

<p>Based on the current definition of the resource, this would need to be an extension.  Most likely a reference to the Organization|Practitioner|RelatedPerson|Patient|Group|CareTeam who was acting as a back-up to the care-team participant.</p>

<p>You wouldn't just update the Care Team resource? or create new ones based on the periods closing and re-opening as needed.</p>

<p>Wouldn't you create a new <code>CareTeam</code> resource, for the appropriate period, and reference it from <code>CarePlan.careTeam</code>? For one team member's vacation, you'd have 3 resources: 1. original team, 2. copy of the team minus vacationer plus cover, 3. copy of the original team with new <code>period</code>.</p>
<p>Thinking aloud: could <code>CareTeam.period</code> become an array, to avoid copies of the same team for different periods?</p>
