<p>My country is implementing a national service for issuing a medical certificate (such as a certificate for employment, sick leave, driving license, etc.)—the development team plan to use FHIR document for this.</p>
<p>My question is:<br>
If the patient's health status is entirely normal, can we use the Condition resource for this? Or should we use other resources like ClinicalImpression?</p>
<p>And about the terminology;<br>
In ICD-10, there is a code like Z00.0 General medical examination or Z02.4 Examination for driving license, but I can't find codes for the same purpose on SNOMED CT. Or just a code that say the patient is healthy. Are there SNOMED CT codes for these situations?</p>

<p>It's not <em>wrong</em> to have a Condition that says "normal health", though it's not something that's typically done.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span> - thoughts on the SNOMED codes question?</p>

<p>Condition is specifically named "Condition" and not "problem" because it's scope does include documented positive things about health, such as 'pregnant', or 'healthy'</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="301593">@Rath Panyowat</span>  Yes, agree that Condition can be used for this.  The documentation states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The condition resource may be used to record a certain health state of a patient which does not normally present a negative outcome, e.g. pregnancy. The condition resource may be used to record a condition following a procedure, such as the condition of Amputee-BKA following an amputation procedure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though the Condition documentation doesn't address the "healthy" or "well" states explicitly, they are included by implication in the statement above.  And SNOMED CT does have a code for <code>102499006 |Fit and well (finding)|</code>, as well as multiple subtype codes including those for "Well adult", "Well child", etc.</p>
