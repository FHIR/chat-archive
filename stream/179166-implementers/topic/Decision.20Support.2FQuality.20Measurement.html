<p>Bryn, will your forthcoming changes remove CarePlan.activity.detail and replace with reference to ActivityDefinition?  Or will current embedded detail remain, and ActivityDefinition be added to the list of CarePlan.activity.reference (which results in implementer ambiguity about which should be used)?</p>

<p>Neither, the CarePlan.activity.detail would be used if the ActivityDefinition wasn't describing a specific request resource. If it did describe a specific Request resource, like ProcedureRequest say, then that resource would be the target of the reference element, and the detail element wouldn't be used.</p>

<p>We will probably want to add the ability for a CarePlan as a whole to reference the PlanDefinition that it was based on. And then within the request resources, you use the basedOn element (recommended by the Work Flow task force) to reference the ActivityDefinition.</p>

<p>Thanks Bryn, would be helpful to include some of this guideance in the IG.  You specifically cited CarePlan, then said "ActivityDefinition is separated out so it can be used by itself, as well as reused in multiple plans if appropriate."  Now, if I understand, the "plan" in this last statement is a PlanDefinition, not a CarePlan...</p>

<p>Good to hear about this distinction between activity and action. Sounds like, at one level of abstraction, an action is a finer grain of behavioural element than activity (which also applies to their templates, i.e. Definition elements); this is in line with several modelling approaches, including one from the ISO standard, Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP), stating that 'activity is a single-headed DAG of actions, where occurrence of each action in the graph is made possible by the occurrence of all immediately preceding actions'; further, according to this standard, activity may be used, to describe a process (or workflow), described as  a 'collection of steps taking place in a prescribed manner', by substituting 'step' with 'action' and 'process' for 'activity'. In the case of FHIR workflow project, 'step' can be realised using 'Task'</p>

<p>Ok - as a follow on to Task discussion, since Task Resource is based on the Oasis Human Task and that specification uses 'notification' to signify when an important occurrence of interest to people happened, why was it decided to use 'event' and not 'notification' for this one-way type of interaction in the FHIR workflow ? This compliance with the nominated specification would avoid few ambiguities to those familiar with such specifications, unless there is a strong reason not to use 'notification' as it is used elsewhere </p>

<p>In don't understand what you mean by "decided to use 'event'".  Task is a resource like any other.  It gets updated the same as any other and you can discover information about it like any other - by querying, polling, receiving it in a message, being pinged by a subscription, etc.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191398">@Zoran Milosevic</span> maybe you've mixed something up here.The 'event' resource is in a workflow context more like a response to a 'request', just like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> wrote in the mentioned mail: "Most of the listed resources are categorized as either a "request" - a resource that indicates a specific intention for something to occur; or an "event" - a resource that represents a specific occurrence that could have been done in response to a request." and will not be used as notification. Notifications can be done for example via the 'MessageHeader' resource. </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191890">@Reinhard Egelkraut</span>  Perhaps I should ask here question to what extent is really FHIR workflow architecture compliant with the OASIS WS-Human Task as specified here  <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/bpel4people/ws-humantask-1.1-spec-cs-01.pdf" target="_blank" title="http://docs.oasis-open.org/bpel4people/ws-humantask-1.1-spec-cs-01.pdf">http://docs.oasis-open.org/bpel4people/ws-humantask-1.1-spec-cs-01.pdf</a> ? This was mentioned in several postings and thus I follow this approach. This would help me understand whether we are talking  about a synchronous call back from the 'event' to the 'request' and if so, how a Request resource, Task resource and Event resource communicate. Who maintains context information supporting call back between the invoked task and 'parent' task (Figure 5 in the Oasis specification). Is Task Parent (as per Oasis Human Task spec)  a Request resource in FHIR workflow?  Then, how do we support Notifications as per the OASIS specification, as a one-way notification (e.g. timeouts etc), as per my earlier question? This is not a messaging rather a workflow (or even better) distributed systems coordination question. </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191398">@Zoran Milosevic</span> I'll be posting a page next week that summarizes the wide variety of options for communicating tasks and their statuses between placers and fillers.  A notification-based approach is one, but there are others and we certainly won't force a single architectural approach because we need to support a wide variety of paradigms.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> . That would be really good. Would be also good if that page could include an end-to-end example showing sequence of actions/steps involving placers, fillers and tasks. It would be also good to show some kind of 'mapping' to the Oasis Human Tasks spec, as appropriate</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191398">@Zoran Milosevic</span> I believe we have mappings on the resource itself.  The workflow page probably won't talk much about the Oasis stuff in my first pass because I'm not familiar with it, but we can probably get more adjustments in going forward once there's something for those who are knowledgable to edit.</p>

<p>usually, implementers just define extensions, add them to the connectathon streams, use them, and then propose changes after the connectathon</p>

<p>There's been discussion with the Pharmacy WG about turning dosage instructions into a data type that they owned that would then be used in MedicationOrder, MedicationDispense and ActionDefinition, but the work group had some concerns.  (In fact, if I understand things correctly, they had some concerns about the existence of ActivityDefinition in the first place . . .)  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span> or <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191759">@Melva Peters</span> may be able to shed mor light on the current state of discussions.</p>

<p>The Pharmacy WG will continue to discuss moving forward with a data type for dosage instructions.  The concerns raised by Pharmacy were related to the fact that ActivityDefinition has pulled some elements but not all elements related to a medicationOrder that the Pharmacy WG believed should be included.  Pharmacy WG will continue the discussion of a new data type for Dosage instructions leading up to Baltimore WGM and will likely continue in Baltimore</p>
