<p>From: Olga Vovk &lt;<a href="mailto:ovovk@samvit-solutions.com">ovovk@samvit-solutions.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,<br>
I have a research use case, where I need to be able to somehow connect the answers provided to a certain Questionnaire to the FHIR resource.<br>
For example,<br>
I have questionnaire which asks questions related to the imaging study which done to the patient.<br>
The questions like:</p>
<p>*   Is the participant eligible for inclusion on this study? – Yes, No<br>
  *   Was imaging agent administered? – Yes, No<br>
  *   Was imaging completed? – Yes, No</p>
<p>All the above questions are part of a certain research questionnaire, and I need to connect the answers collected in the corresponding QuestionnaireResponse to<br>
the related ImagingStudy resource.</p>
<p>I already asked a similar question in “ImagingStudy related questions” thread, and I am very grateful to Lloyd and Elliot for answering and providing a very valuable advice.<br>
I did my research on FHIR Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse resources and I was thinking a lot, but I still have no idea what would be the best way to do it ☹</p>
<p>Thank you!!!</p>
<p>Olga Vovk<br>

<p>The simplest way is to have a question in your Questionnaire whose answer is a Reference to the ImagingStudy.  Without a user actually picking the study from a user interface, I can't imagine how else you'd figure out the linkage.  The SDC IG has a number of extensions that allow you to filter what types of References are allowed for a particular answer.</p>

<p>HI Lloyd, thank you very much.<br>
Having a question in the Questionnaire   which answer is a Reference to the ImagingStudy or any other resource  is a very good idea. Thank you!<br>
Olga</p>
