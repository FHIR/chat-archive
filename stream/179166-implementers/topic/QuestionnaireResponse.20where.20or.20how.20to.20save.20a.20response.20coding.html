<p>Hello community. An analysis/definition question: currently, in our external system, responses are registered and for this we use QuestionnaireResponse.<br>
Then, on these answers, revisions and annexes are made. These annexes are not modifications of the answers, these are added and complement the initial answer (and are stored in tables of our system other than those of answers).</p>
<p>We need, through FHIR, to be able to send to save this information related to a QuestionnaireResponse and then to also be able to retrieve it through GETs. Either retrieving the QResponse and returning the information within it or retrieving it individually and containing a reference to the QResponse.<br>
What is recommended as a good practice to implement this type of situation in FHIR or where to save this information?</p>
<p>I write the question in a generic way about saving info annexes about an answer (QResponse), in particular what we want to store is an encoding of that answer that is not known at first and then yes. And it is not registered by modifying the answer... is added elsewhere, associating the code with that answer. And then you should be able to query the before and after response (before uncoded, then coded).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Fran,</p>
<p>You might get more answers on the Questionnaire stream.</p>
<p>Your implementation is very interesting. </p>
<p>I am a newbie, so I don't know the best practices and I would also like to learn more about this topic. </p>
<p>We have a few times when the data is not available at the time of the questionnaire completion, but will become available later.</p>
<p>What we are doing is creating hidden child questions in the questionnaire as "placeholders".  We are using a default initial value of "n/a"  for these questions when we create the questionnaire response.</p>
<p>When the data becomes available later, our software app sends a PATCH  to modify the pertinent items in the questionnaire response from "n/a" to the actual data. </p>
<p>This way, when we retrieve the updated questionnaire response via GET, it has all of the already existing data plus the new data.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="372568">@Fran del Río</span> Can you give some concrete examples of the types of supplemental information you'd be capturing?</p>

<p>Hi Diane and Lloyd. Yes <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> ,  I describe the main example: I have an answer to a question in text mode (no coding). This answer is then encoded, assigning it an alphanumeric code (this is what is done next).<br>
So we need to be able to add this code to the response (maybe in a new sub item, I don't know if this is ok) and then, by doing GET, to be able to return the response history with the changes it has had (without coding, then with code xx1, then code xx2, etc). <br>

<p>Is the QuestionnaireResponse considered to be 'complete' prior to this encoding process?  If not, then you could do it as a child question that's enabled based on the role of the form filler.  If it's complete, then you'd need a separate Questionnaire that supports population from a previously filled-in QuestionnaireResponse.</p>

<p>Is there an example of the first case that I can refer to please?<br>

<p>No examples of enabling a question based on the role of the form filler.  You'd need to use the <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-launchContext.html">launchContext</a> extension to pass in the information about the current user and the <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-enableWhenExpression.html">enableWhenExpression</a> to turn the question on and off.  SDC has examples for both of the extensions, but no example that combines both.</p>
