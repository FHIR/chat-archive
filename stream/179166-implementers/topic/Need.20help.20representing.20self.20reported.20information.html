<p>I have a usecase where a Patient registers himself/herself in a mobile healthcare app and answers questions like "Do you have insurance?", "What is your height and weight?", "How many doc visits have you had in the past year?" etc. While I can just use a Patient FHIR resource for representing name, gender, ethnicity etc., how would I represent the answers to the questions mentioned above? Would height and weight be considered an "observation"? Do I need to create a dummy Coverage FHIR resource with ref back to this Patient to represent that the Patient has insurance? Would doctor visits count as Encounters and would FHIR resources need to be created to track this? I believe a QuestionnaireResponse might be enough to capture answers as simple valueStrings or integers. But curious to know how folks are doing this in production apps...Any help on this would be appreciated! Thanks.</p>

<p>Height and weight are definitely observations.  So would "doc visits in the past year".  "Do you have insurance?" could be an observation - it's a point-in-time assertion.  You don't really have enough information to create a Coverage instance.  QuestionnaireResponse might be a useful tool to manage the data capture.</p>

<p>ok great! Thanks for your inputs, Lloyd!</p>
