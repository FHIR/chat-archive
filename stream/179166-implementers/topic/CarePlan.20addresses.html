<p>I need to define a Careplan that addresses both a primary and a number of secondary conditions. What would you suggest in terms of design? If I include a rank as an extension, it becomes separate from the CarePlan.addresses field. I could also define an extension that has both the rank and the reference to condition - however, that would be overlapping with the addresses attribute, which is a problem in an interoperability framework, because the condition that a CarePlan adresses could then be found in different fields. Finally, I could slice CarePlan.adresses - and point to a primaryConditionProfile and a ConditionProfile respectively. I do not like this option, because the  primaryConditionProfile and ConditionProfile would be so similar that they do not really need two different profiles.</p>
<p>What I really need is a structure similar to the Encounter.diagnosis.</p>
<p>BTW: I agree with the arguments in an earlier stream (<a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Type.20of.20Condition">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Type.20of.20Condition</a>), that the context defines the rank/use of a condition - but a CarePlan gives such a context - just like an encounter does.</p>

<p>Define an extension on CarePlan.addresses that specifies a rank</p>
