<p>I've looked at the guidance that the FHIR provides wrt multi-language support ( <a href="http://build.fhir.org/languages.html">http://build.fhir.org/languages.html</a>). </p>
<p>What's missing are some best practices: if you do already support multiple languages in your system, what are your recommendations for others working on such implementations? For example, if possible one should ensure that 'reference data' (code systems, value sets, other core registries such a MPIs or Medication registries) already contain translated descriptions.  </p>
<p>Automatic translation (at run time, when queried for data) is risky from a patient safety perspective. If one were to do so, one would have to clearly designate that translation as being a automatic translation (and hence: less reliable).</p>
