<p>Starting real deployments of FHIR via IHE MHD. Run into the absence of practitionerRole from document.reference.author . Can see this is in in the "build" version but now with a remnamed root of agent. However not in encounter.particicpant. Somewhat perplexed/upset/other negtive adjectives that there are so many changes in root names. NOT HELPFUL in order to be compliant every change is a recode for users - as far as I can see.  Any advice comment</p>

<p>The root names are changing as part of an effort to increase consistency across resources.  We're not <em>forcing</em> consistency - it's up to each work group to decide whether they have unique requirements that justifies having a distinct name.  However, we're nudging in that direction where the only reason for distinct names is that the artifacts were created by different groups.  We realize this has an impact on existing implementers, but we're also trying to design for long-term implementation.  When we make these changes for widely implemented artifacts (FMM level 4/5), we do consult with the implementation community first and their opinion is taken into account.  This consistency effort is also working to propagate PractitionerRole everywhere it makes sense too.  You should see that in the version of the resources that comes out in the April ballot.  (And if you're not happy with the changes, you can absolutely share that feedback as a ballot response.</p>

<p>Or if practitionerrole isn't in places where you think it should be, please log it via the link at the bottom of the page in the spec.<br>

<p>Hello, wondering if there is a reason why  Practitioner resource doesn't have 'specialty' attribute?</p>

<p>Thus is on the practitioner role resource, as the specialty is applied to places where they work.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191367">@Brian Postlethwaite</span>  isn't specialty is something that relates to a person education? it's just seems like I have to use PractitonerRole resource for patient's PCP only because it has specialty attribute. I agree that practitioner may have several specialties which are applicable in different cases, but at the same time all these specialties are related to the person as well, or am I missing something here ?</p>

<p>We have also considered putting it under the qualification, as it would be relevant to that, in recording something that needs to be checked/tracked with registrations and expiries etc. <br>
But for searching in a directory, or ensuring the details of a clinic are right, we really care about what the are employed to do at a place. <br>
Doesn't matter if the practitioner had a specialty in paediatrics if he's working in an aged care facility 3 days a week, and in community clinics 2 days.</p>

<p>It would be good to note that when specialties represent 'education, they should be captured as qualifications, whereas PractitionerRole.specialty represents functional role.</p>

<p>Isn't there an overlap with code (role) here? In our implementation, we've decided to remove specialty in favour of code ('role') to avoid confusion...</p>

<p>And in the implementation David refers to  we are also adding an extension to practitioner for the pratitioner's "scope of practice" which is assigned  by our medical licensing agencies and is essentially the specialty they are qualified to practice.  A practitioner can have many scopes of practice.</p>
