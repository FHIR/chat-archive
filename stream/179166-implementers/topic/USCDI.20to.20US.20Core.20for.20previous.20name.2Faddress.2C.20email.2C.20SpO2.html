<p>Tagging <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191410">@Brett Marquard</span> because he previously provided <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html</a> in another thread, and hoping he might have answers to questions below: </p>
<p>I'm checking for USCDI compliance, and was unclear how to identify previous name and previous address. <br>
Do we simply use the tag 'use': "old" to identify a previous name or previous address? <br>
If so, should that be added to the URL above for clarity?<br>
And would current address and current name utilize 'use': "current" ?</p>
<p>USCDI also requires email address for the patient, but I don't see that mentioned in the general guidance for FHIR. I am guessing we would use patient.telecom, with 'system' = "email" ? If so should we add this to the general guidance? It's probably obvious if you're already familiar with the telecom field, but I had to look at the profile to find this.</p>
<p>Lastly, USCDI's Inhaled oxygen concentration and Pulse oximetry are both mapped to US Core Pulse Oximetry. Anyone know the difference between Inhaled oxygen vs pulse oximetry? I'll also ask ONC but was curious if anyone here knows.</p>

<p>Because inhaled oxygen concentration is a component of a O2 Saturation observation (of which pulse oximetry is a style of measuring). <br>
ie O2 Sat = 92% with 0 inhaled oxygen <br>
vs O2 Sat = 99% with 5 inhaled oxygen </p>
<p>inhaled oxygen is not an observation in itself, it is a factor that modifies the base observation, O2 sat via pulse oximetry in this case.</p>

<p>Robert, yes that is very helpful. I missed that note. That said, the name field also has the "use" field, with one value being "old". Could institutions choose to simply use this rather than period if they wanted to? I'm thinking we will generally not know when the previous name stopped being in use -- might be simply to just tag it with the "old" flag.</p>

<p>I'd like to suggest that we flag previous names by using name.'use' = "old", rather than using the period field. Reasoning is we are very unlikely to know the legal end date for the previous name. </p>
<p>I also think we should be consistent and do the same thing for previous address.</p>
<p>Who should I provide this suggestion to, so that we can have this added to the US Core pages, and also to the USCDI to US Core mapping page? Or is there a process or ticketing system by which I need to submit this?</p>
<p>I know this may seem like a small thing, but it is relates to USCDI and I think it would be good to provide uniform guidance to implementers on US Core.</p>

<p>At the bottom of each page is a link to <code>Propose a Change</code>, which is the HL7 Jira instance that is used to manage changes to the spec.  If it is your first time using the system, you'll need to create an account, I believe.</p>

<p>One potential solution is to use a DataAbsentReason on <code>period.end</code>, but that doesn't feel quite right.  I'm also interested in the right way of handling this. Also, what if the <code>period.end</code> is in the future?  Is it still a previous name, or a current name?</p>

<p>I don't think there is such a thing as a "legal" end date for a name.  You can do a legal name change, but that isn't the same thing as previous names necessarily.   I agree that use=old is a much better option than a name.period.  Name usage doesn't really have a firm start and end date.  They might on legal documents, but that is just one use context for names.</p>
