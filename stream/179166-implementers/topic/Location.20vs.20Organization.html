<p>Hello All,<br>
can you help us to understand FHIR modeling to represent Patient &amp; its department association ? Also association between Practitioner &amp; department ? <br>
here department i mean  is  a specialized care unit within a Hospital.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>1. Organization can be 'nested' down to the level of department through the 'partOf' element.<br>
2. Patient refers to the custodion of its record through the 'managingOrganization' element, that refers to an Organization.<br>
3. Where a Patient is actually treated is recorded in an Encounter, that refers to both the Patient (subject element) and the Organization (possibly multiple) via the location element.<br>
3. Practitioner is connected to an Organization through a third resource: PractitionerRole.<br>

<p>Thanks  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191757">@Christiaan Knaap</span> <br>
so just to confirm understanding..in order to model the 'Patients association (enrolling) with multiple departments within Hospital'  shall we represent it by separate Encounter instances where Encounter.Location represents department ? <br>
Regards,</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="218784">@vkapil</span>  Encounter.location would represent the physical location of the department (building, room, ....), which is detailed in the referenced Location resource.<br>
A department in terms of an organizational unit would be referenced via Encounter.serviceProvider (reference to an Organization).</p>
<p>Like: the urology department may be located partially in floor 5 south and partially in floor 8 north. In this case "urology department" is an Organization while "floor 5 south" and "floor 8 north" are two different Locations</p>
