<p>I'm working with a clinic that collects the patients' "level of care" by using questionnaires. I'm gonna store the clinic data in FHIR resources. Does it make sense to store the "level of care" in both QuestionnaireResponse and Observation resources at the same time? Or is it a mistake to store a single data point (e.g., level of care) in more than on FHIR resource?</p>

<p>It's certainly not a 'mistake', although if one has different expressions of the same data point you'll have to ensure that they stay in sync if one of them were to be updated (which is not the case here). Questionnaire Responses are quite often transformed into 'other resources' such as Observations.</p>

<p>You can link the Observation and the QuestionnaireResponse indicating that the former was derived from the latter using Observation.derivedFrom.  If deriving other resources, you can also use Provenance</p>
