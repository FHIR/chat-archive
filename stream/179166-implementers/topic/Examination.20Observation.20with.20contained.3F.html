<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We are trying to implement Examination which contains multiple Observations(Eye, Head, Ear and etc)  comes around 100+ observations in it.</p>
<p>By using we can save single Patient Examination Observation with in  contained (* where contained have multiple Observations and few of them child observations have contained with another sub child observations).</p>
<p>By using contained, We can easily save and retrieve Examination Observation.</p>
<p>But we are facing issue while creating Analytics or some filters need to get List of Observations who suffering from Eye related and etc. Because we are unable to get the resources which are added in contained without getting main examination observation.</p>
<p>Can you Please Suggest us ,</p>
<p>Is it better to take individual observations for each in Examination or <br>
Can we take single observation which contains all child Observations in contained?</p>

<p>I think your problem stems from your use of Contained. This should be only used when that which is contained has no need to be visible outside of that which it is contained within. You have clearly indicated a need that counters this.  Thus you should not be using contained.</p>

<p>Contained is not a handy-dandy way of avoiding multiple REST calls.  If, for some reason, you can't handle multiple REST calls for content that qualifies as stand-alone, look at using the document or messaging paradigm.</p>
