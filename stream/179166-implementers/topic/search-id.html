<p>Hi, when performing a search against Grahame's server, a new parameters search-id is automatically added to the Get query string with a generated GUID. I'm wondering if this search-id parameter is documented anywhere in the FHIR spec (I couldn't find any documentation) as we consider implementing this parameter for audit purposes.</p>

<p>What the search documents is that the server can add additional parameters to the additional links for the purposes of managing state as the client moves through the pages of a search. You cannot rely on that for anything else</p>

<p>Thank you Grahame. We have a fedrated systems, and in order to support audit log by both our FHIR system and our federated partner, we would need some shared search identifier. Thus, on our part we can find what the search request &amp; response were and who was our fedrated partner, while on the partner's side, they would be able to track this further to find who the user was, what she/he was doing, etc. An equivalent of your server's search-id would work for us if we either get it from the consumers as a search parameter or generate it on our end and return to the partner system with the search response. I just wanted to confirm that this doesn't break any FHIR rules (based on the fact that your server returns search-id, I assume it's fine with FHIR).</p>

<p>If you need it from the client, you could define a custom search parameter, but you'd need custom agreement for others to support it.  If it's part of a query response clients can ignore, you can send what you like.  If it's something needed for query continuation, just embed it in your continuation links.</p>

<p>if you're just returning it from the server. then: </p>

<p>see <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#paging" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#paging">http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#paging</a>. I guess we could be a little more explicit that the server can add parameters as it sees fit</p>

<p>Thank you Lloyd and Grahame! Most likely, we will implement this as part of a query response. I just wasn't sure if search-id was Grahame's local implementation or it was a new, not yet documented FHIR feature, but now I understand that this is a local implementation of the server's felxibilty to return additional parameters.</p>

<p>Igor, can you submit a change request for us to clarify about the ability to add parameters in a response?</p>
