<p>Are these the best sources for documentation for SMART?</p>
<p>Technical Documentation:<br>
<a href="http://docs.smarthealthit.org/" target="_blank" title="http://docs.smarthealthit.org/">http://docs.smarthealthit.org/</a> </p>
<p>Tutorials:<br>
<a href="http://docs.smarthealthit.org/tutorials/" target="_blank" title="http://docs.smarthealthit.org/tutorials/">http://docs.smarthealthit.org/tutorials/</a></p>
<p>Server Implementation:<br>
<a href="http://docs.smarthealthit.org/tutorials/server-quick-start/" target="_blank" title="http://docs.smarthealthit.org/tutorials/server-quick-start/">http://docs.smarthealthit.org/tutorials/server-quick-start/</a> </p>
<p>Are there others? It seems like there could be more on server implementation (and a full end-to-end example).</p>
<p>I'm working on a new project and would very much like to propose SMART as a solution for an interoperability piece we will need to implement.  I'll need to sell this proposed solution to leadership on the project and detailed documentation will go a long way in doing this.  </p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
John</p>

<p>Of course there's the technical documentation for the protocol itself at <a href="http://docs.smarthealthit.org/authorization" target="_blank" title="http://docs.smarthealthit.org/authorization">http://docs.smarthealthit.org/authorization</a>. Then there are the "Run Apps" menu Link's at <a href="https://smarthealthit.org" target="_blank" title="https://smarthealthit.org">https://smarthealthit.org</a>. The major vendors have sites outlining their own support. That's about the size of it. #smart would be a good place to describe what additional documents you would find helpful.</p>

<p>Thanks Josh! Is it correct to say SMART is primarily authentication/authorization and is not so much concerned with the content of what information is sent between the server and the client.  SMART on FHIR uses SMART for authentication/authorization and FHIR for messages sent by both the client and the server.  I would imagine that there are also hybrid solutions where the client sends a FHIR message and the server returns content that can be directly rendered by the client (e.g. HTML5).  Is this correct?</p>

<p>The landing page of <a href="http://docs.smarthealthit.org" target="_blank" title="http://docs.smarthealthit.org">http://docs.smarthealthit.org</a> probably sent it the best way I know how it <span class="emoji emoji-1f642" title="simple smile">:simple_smile:</span> and in short, SMART aims to define an app framework. (We are very deeply concerned with data consistency --for which we rely on the Argonaut profiles in the US -- as well as the way in which contextual information is passed from an EHR to an app.)</p>

<p>It sounds like I somewhat conflated Smart with CDS Hooks.  Also, it looks like neither of these are suited to our use case.  We have an existing web application that is called from an EHR.  The EHR currently just opens the url in a browser.  We would like to integrate the existing web page directly into the application.  It sounds like the easiest way to implement that would be to simply open the web app in a native widget for displaying html in the EHR (e.g. Java) using something like OAuth for authentication.  Is there something that FHIR/CDS Hooks/Smart would improve upon this type of solution (with out having to rewrite the entire existing web application to use FHIR messaging)?</p>

<p>well, Smart App Launch (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch">http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch</a>) is what you want, but whether that requires you to 'rewrite the existing web application to use FHIR messaging' is not clear - it would depend on your application, but I think not so much</p>
