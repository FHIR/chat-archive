<p>more, for people's review:<br>
- I added  a new page: <a href="http://build.fhir.org/patterns.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/patterns.html">http://build.fhir.org/patterns.html</a><br>
- I added a new set of patterns that are much more tight and suitable for code generation<br>
- I use the pattern as a reference target: Communication.recipient</p>
<p>I still have some issues to sort out.</p>

<p>A couple of questions:<br>
1) do workgroups have the ability to create patterns as they see fit or is it similar governance to resources?<br>
2) will we be able to create patterns in Implementation Guides?<br>
3) can WGs start changing their resources to use the patterns now, i.e. I'm assuming the build tools now support the patterns?</p>

<p>1. It should definitely be a lower bar than resources, but it's also a team activity. So I propose that new patterns should be created via MnM<br>
2. Yes, you already can, but they won't quite have the same implication<br>
3. yes as far as I can see, the support is complete.</p>

<p>I'm not overly thrilled with this.  Participant-Contactable and Participant-Living should never be used without also having PractitionerRole as an option.  I'm very concerned that designers will somehow feel that these patterns trump applying the 80% rule - and they don't.  I also think that 'hiding' the list of available resources behind pattern names does a disservice to readers.  It adds a level of indirection to understanding what's going on.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Contrary to this, I feel that the 'hiding' does a better job of further communicating the purpose of a field.  Looking at Communication.receiver vs Communication.sender,  I can see that a receiver is intended to be a Participant, but sender is different.  If sender was converted to Reference(Participant | HealthcareDevice), I suddenly get a better view who/what might be sending Communications.</p>
<p>Committees will be able to look at these common interface patterns and assume that they have been vetted by many committees and users and can start with the classes in those patterns.  If they decide that the pattern classes fit their use cases, then the can reference the pattern directly.  If not, they can be explicit.  Implementers/spec-readers will know, however, that the committee made a conscious choice to deviate from the pattern as opposed to now where we wonder how explicit a committee was being.  When I looked at the list of class combos that Grahame spit out, there were some that just caused me to go "huh?".  I suspect that many of those slight differences will go away now that committees can see (and potentially adopt) the common interface pattern.</p>

<p>The vetting by other work groups doesn't matter when a WG is evaluating their own use.  Just because Patient or Device is allowed as a participation in some places doesn't mean it will meet the 80% criteria for your domain.  We want differences to go away that are there unnecessarily.  We <em>don't</em> want differences to go away that are caused by legitimate domain differences.

<p>Except that implementers will push back if the appropriate analysis hasn't happen.  "Why is Device included in the list of X for this data element?" will always be a question that gets asked of a workgroup and a resource.  And the workgroup will need to justify the use of these resources.</p>

<p>I agree that splitting Practitioner and PractitionerRole is problematic, but I think there's little chance of that being reversed at this stage.  And if it's not, its absence from these patterns is going to cause huge problems.  The issue is that "what's easy to interface" and "what's useful to combine" are different criteria.</p>

<p>I don't understand your concern as specific to these interface patterns.  When I'm looking for a participant, I go and look at existing resources to see what they have and I start from that.  I then add or delete or leave as specified according to my needs.  How is that going to be any different with these patterns?  They provide a wonderful starting point.</p>

<p>The pattern is useless as a starting point if you diverge from the starting point because you then need to replace the pattern with a full enumerated list.  And you'll also have people ragging on you about why you didn't use the pattern.</p>
<p>The syntactic sugar is driven by "which classes have resources elements" as opposed to "which resources are commonly used together" - and those are completely different lists.  The latter might be useful.  The first isn't useful for design - and is likely to lead to poor design choices.</p>

<p>a) Just because I need to diverge doesn't make the pattern useless.  That argument would apply equally to the Request and Event pattern - why do we have MedicationRequest since I could just use the Request pattern.  Because the WG took the pattern and analyzed it and diverged where they felt the need to.  This would work the same with these interface patterns <em>except</em> that if I didn't diverge, I can just use the syntactic sugar to represent the list of classes.</p>
<p>b) If a committee can't elaborate on why they didn't use the pattern, then that might be a reason why they should have used it.  "Your data element looks like a participant, but you only have Patient and RelatedPerson, are you sure that the other resources in the Participant pattern aren't appropriate?" looks like a totally justified question that I better have an answer to.</p>

<p>This objection would be to the current content of the patterns and not to the use of the patterns per se.  I am actually with you on the content, but Grahame just started with a common set of resources.  We need to push back on the patterns to see if they are correct.</p>

<p>Moving away from the discussion of the patterns that Grahame created, I'd like to explore the use of these interface patterns as a way for a resource creator to delay defining the specific set of resources that would be referenced by a data element.  I'm thinking of CatalogEntry and ChargeItemDefinition.</p>
<p>Would it make sense to have metadata around a pattern as to whether it was open or closed?  By open, I mean a pattern that a content creator could to add by simply tagging their resource.  By closed, to get a new resource added would require a tracker item.</p>
<p>As an example, ChargeItemDefinition.instance would be Reference(ChargeableItem) and ChargeableItem would be an open interface.  Then the resources that would be considered to be ChargeableItems would add some tag in their definition to be included in the list.</p>

<p>The patterns Grahame has defined are <em>not</em> patterns that reflect what WGs have typically done.  They are patterns that reflect what resources have common elements that make them amenable to the construction of interfaces.  I.e. they were designed on the basis of what might be useful to generate code for, <em>not</em> what constitutes good or appropriate design practice.  But the proposal is to push them into design practice.  I think that's a mistake.</p>
<p>If in implementation, someone wants to process Patients and Practitioners and RelatedPersons with the same set of code, that's a totally appropriate use for these patterns.  But the fact that the resources reflect a particular common set of elements doesn't really have much relevance to appropriateness for use in a given model.  And it's not that helpful for a reader either.  Someone skimming a resource is going to see "Participant" and that's not going to tell them anything - it's certainly not going to break any pre-conceived mental presumptions they have about what participant might or might not include, nor is it going to encourage them to think about which of the set of allowed resources they're going to want to constrain out - or mandate support for.</p>

<p>"Implementers aren't doing a great job of pushing back..."  -- from my perspective it seems that push-back is sometimes futile since the resources have already got too much momentum to change at this point; your example of Practitioner and PractitionerRole being a prime example.   Also for folks who are implementers not modelers, there are real-world concerns of 'getting the job done' that have higher priority.   I remember asking the question about why MedicationRequest.category and MedicationAdministration.category have different cardinalities and ended up down a long discussion path that wasn't that fruitful from my perspective as a developer.   It seemed to me that the cardinality difference was an error of omission, not a conscious decision of the committee but it took weeks to get to that understanding.   Yes, we probably need more input from implementers but it is not 'inexpensive' for implementers to get involved and if their efforts aren't seen as productive, they will 'shy away' from participating.</p>

<p>1. I think introducing patterns into the design process as something that can be explicitly referenced by designers is a mistake:<br>
- it hides what resources are actually available from both the authors and the readers<br>
- it adds complexity to profiling constraints (and those are complex enough, thanks)<br>
- it encourages adherence to patterns over adherence to the 80% rule and the latter is more important than the former<br>
2. If we were going to introduce patterns into the design process, the patterns should be based on whats commonly implemented together, not what happens to have common attributes.  The latter has no place in the design process at all.  If such patterns are going to be used, they belong only in the implementation space.  (Which also means that it would be fine to add Person into the Living Participant pattern, because you'd only care about the attributes, not where they're used.)<br>
Note: I'm in favor of encouraging greater consistency - and specifically on eliminating as much as possible those errors of omission that create grief.  But I'm not in favor of making the modeling neater at the price of no longer reflecting the reality of what systems do.  Our objective with the FHIR core spec is <em>not</em> to change what data systems capture and false consistency of resource designs when underlying implementations don't reflect that doesn't help anyone.</p>

<p>I completely agree with John Silva. I think it sums up exactly the kinds of problems we are facing as well. Some of the resource divergences from patterns seem fairly arbitrary but come at a cost for implementers. While these do get fixed, it requires tremendous effort and time commitment. In the meantime, we address these inconsistencies in code but now the problem has been pushed to all implementers of FHIR. I would favor two views of FHIR, the resource view and a more consistent (and stable) view based on patterns where all participations, for instance, are addressed in a consistent way.</p>

<p>the problem is that there is no consistency in participations in the real world. The risk, then, is that we impose a fantasy consistency that isn't real. And it does seem pretty likely to me...</p>

<p>If you look at performer for instance, there is great variation across resources - naming of attributes, types allowed for choices, attributes that make up the participation in the first place. Yet, they all look roughly the same - give or take a few attributes such as period or required. If the resource wishes to name these things differently, okay. The pattern, on the other hand can be consistent. Often, even the variation in choice types seems odd (sometimes CareTeam is in, sometimes it is out, etc...). I think that there is a lot that could still be done to make the resources more consistent and the patterns useful while still meeting the other requirements of FHIR.</p>

<p>HealthCareService (and CareTeam) have both evolved, which is part of the challenge.  The former used to talk about "a capacity", but is now being used as a sub-organizational unit.  CareTeam is similar, though it's been around for longer so has propagated further.</p>
<p>CareTeam or HealthService doing dispenses doesn't really make sense.  I can't imagine a use-case where that would ever be tracked at that granularity in practice.  Same is true for RiskAssessments.  A Patient or care-giver might complete the questionnaire that serves as input to the assessment.  However the determination that you have a 23.7% chance of getting diabetes by age 50 is going to be made by a Device or a Practitioner, never by the patient or caregiver themselves.</p>

<p>You still need to prune out the ones that don't make sense/would never be supported in a particular use-case.  For example, Patients/RelatedPersons aren't allowed to be the "performers" of an immunization.  That's a domain choice reflecting practice.

<p>My gut is that 1/2 to 2/3 of the places we'd look at using these patterns, at least one of the resources in the patterns would need to be yanked out or one or two would need to be added.  Based on past experience with patterns, I'd also expect that many WGs would feel constrained to use the pattern and wouldn't do the necessary yanking/addition. </p>
<p>Let me ask a different question.  If I determine what I need is Patient, Practitioner, PractitionerRole, Organization and Device, how does that impact the utility of the interface pattern from a development perspective?  Is it going to have problems because Practitioner and Device are in the mix?  In either event, does it matter whether the pattern is declared on the design side?</p>

<p>I think it is okay if the pattern is more general than the individual resource. In some cases, some options won't be relevant or used much - as long as they are not semantically wrong - e.g., a related person will generally not administer a vaccine but they could if they were trained to do so and needed to reach an isolated population.</p>

<p>They key is that the pattern is not more narrow than the collection of resources represented by the pattern such that a resource loosens the constraints of the pattern. I have seen that in FHIR where a resource references ANY when the pattern references a specific set of resource types.</p>

<p>Grahame has clarified off-line that the proposed patterns wouldn't replace the type declarations in the StructureDefinitions, which means that my concern about profiling/validation impact goes away and - depending on publishing decisions - may make my hiding concerns go away as well.</p>
<p>Is there something that these patterns add that the existing Event/Definition/Request patterns don't in terms of being able to examine analyis choices made by WGs?  The Event/Definition/Request patterns have the additional benefit that their patterns of references allow different expectations for different types of associations.  And they aren't driven by commonality of attributes, they're driven by commonality of usage.</p>

<p>well, there's 2 different subjects here. one concerns the general utility of the patterns, and the other concerns the particular patterns i chose.

<p>We had a lengthy discussion on the MnM call today about Patterns.  People should come to the next call in two weeks (on the 28th) as I suspect we might talk some more about it.  We agreed that there were three types of "patterns":<br>
1) The existing patterns like Event/Request which are large-scale patterns that are intended to shape resources that want to conform to the pattern.<br>
2) Category patterns where a resource agrees to defer who is being referenced by one of its data elements to other resources.  The clearest example of these would be CatalogEntry having a reference to a CatalogableItem or a ChargeItemDefinition have a reference to a ChargeableItem.  Resources could then declare that they belong to the CatalogableItem category or the ChargeableItem catagory and could be referenced by the parent resources.  I called these "open" patterns in previous postings.  The benefit of this scheme is that the CatalogEntry or ChargeItemDefinition doesn't have to change every time a new resource wants to be cataloged or have a charge definition.<br>
3) The final pattern type is what Grahame has been posting about.  A combination of a pattern that details the data elements (like #1) and also allows resources to talk about sets of resources (like #2).  There is still some debate over how these patterns would be referenced.  Currently, Grahame has the tooling working so that Communication.recipient is a Reference(Practitioner).  There is an argument that this syntactic sugar does not communicate well with implementers.  So that might not stick.  Instead, what appears to be workable is that a resource data element would be marked as a candidate for a pattern, eg. X.performer should be conformant to the Performer resource pattern.  To declare a different set of resources than the pattern would require an override by the resource owner and a clear reason for why the difference exists.  These reasons would be visible in the specification.</p>
<p>For both pattern type #1 and #3, we all agreed that better enforcement of the patterns and a more rigorous treatment of differences needed to happen.  The mechanics of this governance are still to be worked out, but it does mean that those of us who are creating resource definitions will need to pay closer attention to build warnings and QA issues.</p>

<p>In all cases, FMG will be the arbiter of a) what resources/elements should conform to a pattern, b) what resources can claim to belong to a category, and c) when a resource data element can claim to use/follow a pattern.

<p>As an observer of this it seems that having these patterns, formalized or not, is very valuable in getting consistency in the naming and structure of resources developed independently by the different WGs.   As an end-user, I don't necessarily know these WG distinctions and I wonder why the same  structural item (concept/property) is named differently in one resource vs. the other.   I understand the WGs come from their own domain of experience, but to an end user, this domain distinction blurs, because we need to 'get the job done' and consistency helps more than 'domain-specific naming'.    Besides, the (clinical) end users of FHIR do NOT see these naming distinctions, the two groups affected most are the modelers or resource developers but those are few, and the implementers, who, if the standard is working well, are the majority of the users of these resources (patterns).</p>

<p>Our objective is to make FHIR intuitive, particularly to 'simple' implementers - those who might only be worrying about a couple of resources.  Having generic names that don't reflect domain conventions significantly increases the learning curve for those people - and loses one of FHIR's key advantages.  Systems that are interested in sharing code that works across many resources are comparatively less common and always more sophisticated, so dealing with naming variations is something they can more reasonably handle - especially if there are mappings indicating which elements are equivalent.</p>

<p>implementers have roadmaps and some may have several teams. So most teams will start with a couple of resources, then they will add the other resources, or another team will do other resources. Lack of consistency usually hurts much later than when we are starting to adopt.</p>

<p>If the behavior is different, that'll be driven by domain variations, not forced by FHIR.  It certainly sucks when it happens, but the real world is what the real world is.  (I continue to cringe at some of the financial models because they don't do things the 'standard' FHIR way.  But those from the domain consistently say that they're happy and that the models align with how that space works.  It's certainly going to create challenges for those who would prefer that everything worked consistently, but we can't very well tell the whole financial business space to change their business processes to better align with how FHIR would like to see things done.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>'s comment that "there is no consistency in participations in the real world" requires some analysis.  Participation in an event is perfectly well-defined, but who or what can participate in what type of event in what role is highly varied. Every participation should have an actor, associated role, an optional time period and optional "onBehalfOf", but when you look across FHIR, you find this high-level pattern is broken right and left. The low level particulars of who/what can participate in what type of event is also broken because you find numerous cases where the choices are incomplete due to errors and oversights. FHIR puts great faith in the wisdom of work groups, but committees suck at design -- no matter if we are talking patterns OR particulars.</p>

<p>That's the FHIR design rules.  The whole 80% principle is that FHIR tries to adhere to what systems actually support in the real world, not what we wish they did.  As a result there will be inconsistencies in resources that are driven by real-world variations in behavior.  The benefit of that approach is that when you look at FHIR you'll get a sense of what you can reasonably expect (as opposed to seeing a model of the theoretical which never actually gets met in practice).</p>

<p>Participation in an event is perfectly well-defined, but who or what can participate in what type of event in what role is highly varied. Every participation should have an actor, associated role, an optional time period and optional "onBehalfOf"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe, but for example, the time period might be fixed by context for a resource that doesn't represent something that happened over a period of time. Same for role - often fixed by context or element name (though it would be good to have a way to be explicit about that).  And OnBehalf of seems very theoretical to me; I don't see it being used in all but a few legal-ish circumstances</p>

<p>Grahame, I should have said that the pattern of Participation can omit elements if an element is irrelevant in the context where that pattern is used. But the overriding pattern still holds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That isn't evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure what you're looking for.  Are you asking for evidence of disuse?  The onus is actually the other way around in FHIR.  A proponent of having something included in the core specification needs to provide evidence of widespread support (or in limited cases, expected support) for an element to have it included in the specification.</p>
<p>As an example, most systems don't have the ability to capture patients or devices that perform immunizations.  It might be theoretically possible that that could happen sometimes, but if most systems don't have the ability to capture that, it's not going to be supported by the resource - and thus Immunization would diverge from the pattern of the "common" participants.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what evidence you're looking for.  The methodology is the methodology.  It's certainly been adhered to with varying degrees of success (and some of the challenges we've had with adherence has actually been work groups <em>over</em> adhering to patterns rather than focusing on what's common practice).  In any event, the methodology remains the methodology.  Implementers can and should raise tracker items when they feel items are included in a resource that aren't widely supported (as well as the reverse).  In situations where there's a choice between adhering to a pattern or reflecting what most systems do, the current expectation is that work groups will err towards the latter.</p>

<p>Imperfect evidence is better than no evidence at all, and I'll bet $20 (AU or CA) that the bulk of FHIR doesn't literally follow the 80% rule.

<p>I disagree with the premise that divergences from the methodology mean we should change the methodology.  An alternative view is that divergences point to a need for better training and governance.  The objective behind the methodology stands - it's more important to reflect what systems do in a standard than what we'd like them to do.  We want to lower barriers to implementation and also set a common understanding about what's reasonable to expect in other systems.</p>

<p>To me, it seems that there are a few mechanisms that push towards tunnel vision ("we are going to do this for these systems because those are the systems we know of today / we are in a hurry / we don't yet see the big issue") but later it is very hard to broaden, because a decision has been made and "well, why should we reopen things that were voted already?"<br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span>  - thanks for pointing this out.   It sometimes feels like us 'late comers' to the FHIR world have real use cases and real systems that we are dealing with but because the decisions have already been made it's almost impossible to change now.  It seems like there are reasons that decisions had to be made back 4-5 yrs ago based on the 80% principal but the 'contributor world' was relatively small back then that there were most likely very few use cases that were used to make the decisions and now that many more (companies, individuals, new start-ups, government entities) are getting 'into the game' that there may be a need to revisit some of the "80% decisions" made previously.</p>

<p>Indeed sometimes we see this. It is not bad to iterate and that is one success of FHIR IMO : we populated the key areas and we managed the scope quite well, now we see that some decisions were made when we had less insight or we did not know what the next person was working on. But now we know and it feels hard to swim upstream and revisit some decisions. I look forward for some methodology aspects to help collaborate faster. And I think these patterns will help.</p>

<p>With FHIR, I believe we've had a deeper degree of implementation and a longer period of review and broader degree of review than we've had with any previous specification before we moved it to "normative".  The reality is that we have to lock things down at some point - the cost of change becomes too high and the potential instability becomes a barrier to adoption.  That does mean that those who are late to the party may find that there are some things they might wish were different have limited ability to affect change.  However, the way FHIR is designed, it should be exceptionally rare that there's a use-case that simply cannot be implemented because of the normative decisions.  The worst that should happen is that the locked-in solution is sub-optimal for a particular space and requires an unpleasant work-around.</p>
<p>The other thing to consider is that there's a lot of FHIR that <em>isn't</em> locked down yet - and this is definitely the time to review and propose changes before things get locked down further.</p>
