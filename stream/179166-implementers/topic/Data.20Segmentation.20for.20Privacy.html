<p>As you suspect, there is not much use of DS4P... Certainly NOT any use of the fine grain (inside CDA).  It has informed organizations to understand the processing they internally need to do, and it has informed them on how to use the Confidentiality vocabulary. Specifically gave everyone a good use-case for N vs R... And thus gave everyone a reason to look at confidentiality code N vs R when they receive something... BUT for the most part once something is 'imported' into a new system, it is now in that new system and under the rules of that new system.    So the distinction of N vs R is the advancement that DS4P made.</p>

<p>It was asked at the ONC townhall... but the question was more directed at how hard it is when CDA are so poorly created. They were refering to using a Security Labeling Service (SLS) to examine the CDA (which were poorly formed) for sensitive topics. An SLS would identify these using the fine-grain method found in DS4P. This level of labeling is only to be used between the SLS and a Access Control enforcement engine. That is pipelined between the raw CDA and the version delivered to a remote location would be Access Control decision, SLS tagging, then enforcement. The enforcement might block the whole transaction, might redact portions, or just convert the sensitivity vocabulary into a confidentialityCode vocabulary. The enforcement might simply take the original raw CDA and provide it unmodified, with a transport confidentialityCode.</p>

<p>this processing model is not just DS4P, but also SLS, and lots of policy. DS4P is just defining how tags would be carried with a set of levels of effort. Where easy is just setting ConfidentialityCode in metadata and CDA header; where fully hard is this processing model at the fine-grain level inside the CDA; where ludicrous level is including Obligation codes that one expects the recipient to act upon.</p>

<p>This is a very accurate summary of the approach. I can add that in one of the pilots, there was also a natural-language processing engine that would extract clinical codes from the unstructured text in the CDA to feed into the rest of the SLS pipeline. This was used to manage the poor quality of structured coding in CDAs and to improve the accuracy of the SLS decisions. <br>
Also AFAIK, the VA's DS4P and SLS for CDA demo/pilot projects were not open-sourced.</p>

<p>That is why HL7 has defined the "Security Labeling Service". A service for which you give it data, and it labels the data for sensitivity. The service instance you use might be simple, or might include NLP. But it is all behind the SLS api.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196897">@Luca Toldo</span> there are existing services (open-source and proprietary) to extract structured codes (e.g. SNOMED, RxNorm, etc.) from unstructured text. This can be as simple as a look-up for key words or very sophisticated natural language processing for entity extraction with  consideration of nuances like attribution and negation. Once the structured codes are extracted, the document can be processed by the rest of the SLS pipeline, similar to structured/well-formed documents. As John pointed out, this is all under the hood behind the SLS API.</p>

<p>More specifically, we need experts in the technology stack. We have the abstract concept in the existing SLS specification.

<p>seems the service could support bulk data just as easily as single resources. Is it a service that modifies the resources (adding .meta.security values)? Or does it just return a manifest of the assessment relative to the resource, something like a variant of OperationOutcome? The CDA one did modify the CDA, which really bothered me as it was modifying what might eventually be returned, which is a modification of the attested content (signed)...  Seems the goal of the SLS tagging is to inform the decision/enforcement; so the OperationOutcome might be more powerful...</p>

<p>Sounds great; I'll be happy to attend. <br>
I want to add that in our experience, some functions of the labeling service cannot be fully isolated from the transaction context --e.g. for some types of labels like handling instructions or in some cases confidentiality, or high-watermark labels on a bundle. <br>
So our approach in the FHIR demos (which was presented in a number of pervious connectathons) was a service with the following inputs:<br>
- an individual resource or a bundle of resources,<br>
- transaction context, e.g. client id and attributes, purpose of use, etc.<br>
which would output a labeled resource or bundle tailored to that specific transaction context.<br>
The process includes checking overarching labeling rules/policies as well as patient consents. This enabled our demo to support rules like: "for recipient A, HIV resources are marked as Restricted with Delete After Use handling instruction, but for recipient B those resources are Normal."<br>
In such cases, the sensitivity labels (e.g. HIV) can be assigned by a bulk SLS system while the confidentiality and handling instructions are assigned on-the-fly and depending on the transaction context.</p>

<p>I think some labels like sensitivity labels, e.g. HIV and ETH only depend on the content of the resource and therefore can be assigned in bulk, or based on an event triggered by creation/update of a resources and can be persisted on resources.<br>
Other labels like handling instructions and arguably confidentiality labels depend on the transaction context and applicable policies (e.g. SCA may be restricted in one jurisdiction and normal in another jurisdiction). These labels can only be assigned on the fly. Also high-watermark always depends on the content of the collection so will always depend on the response bundle.</p>

<p>There was an earlier variation of the demo in which the SLS was part of the Authorization Service and would return the labels as Obligations. This approach was abandoned for practical reasons since XACML support for obligations was not adequate for this use-case and also performance/complexity.</p>

<p>labeling prior to persistance is a fragile thing. This because the assessment of how sensitive something is, will be different in the future. This because today there is some defined stigma on various concepts, that might change over time. This because today our understanding of a medical condition might be more evolved in the future. Thus I would focus efforts on a SLS use for access authorization decision support.. that is to focus on using a SLS to determine the current medical assessment, against the current stigma, up against the current Privacy Consent, and the current business rules.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> while I definitely agree in principle that SLS rules/policies evolve over time and persisting labels may not seem to be a great idea, I want to add that determining content-based sensitivity labels (such as HIV, ETH) could be a time-consuming process (e.g. when NLP is involved) and in some cases it is not feasible to do that on the fly. So the compromise is to persist labels that are a) time-consuming to compute and b) less likely to change frequently and have other mechanisms such as an SLS crawler + event triggers re-examine those when necessary, e.g. when rules/policies or the content of the resource change.</p>

<p>The SLS will also just be doing sensitivity assessment. It will not be assessing for ConfidentialityCode, Obligations, or Compartments. These sensitivity tags are often just used by the access control enforcement to determine if the resource should be allowed to transfer, should be blocked, or should be redacted. That is to say that the sensitivity vocabulary are not usually communicated beyond the tight relationship between SLS and Access Control Enforcement.</p>

5. Access Control Enforcement examines output of SLS relative to security token/scope to determine if whole result can be returned, or if some data needs to be removed.<br>
6. Access Control Enforcement sets each bundled Resource .meta.security with ConfidentityCode (R vs N), removing the sensitivity codes.<br>
7. Access Control Enforcement determines 'high water mark' ConfidentityCode to tag the Bundle.meta<br>
8. Access Control Enforcement may set other Bundle.meta.security values such as Obligations (e.g. Do-Not-Print)</p>

<p>Note that this flow relies on a narrower definition of SLS, which only assigns sensitivity labels. A broader definition of SLS would include assigning _all_ security labels including the ones assigned by the ACE above. The SLS in this broader sense conducts multiple _passes_ (first pass tagging with sensitivity labels, second pass determining  the confidentiality labels and handling instructions, etc.).</p>
<p>I'm also wondering why the ACE should remove of sensitivity tags. Other than a minuscule addition to the size of the outgoing resource, is there any other reason to get rid of these tags? I think the sensitivity tags on an outgoing resource essentially _cache_ the result of a potentially computationally expensive process and could be useful if the recipient has any use-case to rely on them. For example, if the recipient is subject to different jurisdictional policies which assigns different confidentiality labels to the sensitive information in the resource, it can simply re-use the sensitivity labels instead of re-calcualting them.</p>

<p>not sure why that would be useful. The security tags are in a well-known and fixed location in all Resource types, so one can find the security tags without knowing what kind of resource it is.

<p>There is no such thing as a general de-identification algorithm. You must create a de-identification algorithm that is specific to the data-set you have, your risk tolerance, and the data your intended use needs. It is only after this level of analysis that you can have a project specific algorithm. Once you have that you can pipe the results of a bulk-data (or any kind of data-set) through a de-identification engine charged with that algorithm to produce a dataset that has been statistically inspected for proper risk reduction.

<p>whatever algorithm we have for de-identification, it should be defined at the server side, and it should consider things like purpose, etc. I think this is one of the benefits of DS4P  - it it not to say "this resource is available, this is not" but rather "this data element is classified as XX, see policies to see what to do with it for each request"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as a general de-identification algorithm. You must create a de-identification algorithm that is specific to the data-set you have, your risk tolerance, and the data your intended use needs. It is only after this level of analysis that you can have a project specific algorithm. Once you have that you can pipe the results of a bulk-data (or any kind of data-set) through a de-identification engine charged with that algorithm to produce a dataset that has been statistically inspected for proper risk reduction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's all true, but I think we can define a "necessary but not sufficient" baseline as a starting point. In particular the <code>text</code> contents should always be  deleted and (possibly) regenerated later. I've noticed that a lot of developers working on de-identification algorithms ignore narrative text. There's no reliable algorithm to remove PII/PHI from narrative text so the only safe approach is to delete the whole thing.</p>

<p>We are converting C-CDA's that include DS4P security and confidentiality information to FHIR.   We have included the necessary extensions on the FHIR resources that are contained in a FHIR Bundle with a composition.  These extensions are using the official URL for these extensions as listed on the IG.  The IG is here: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/security-label-ds4p/2021Sep/index.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/security-label-ds4p/2021Sep/index.html</a> </p>
<p>The issue is when running this new file through the HL7 Java validator it is returning a structure error stating that the URL does not resolve.  If a URL is listed as an official URL on an HL7 IG should it not resolve to somewhere?  Instead it currently returns a 404.  Could this be an issue with the validator?  Or is it on a todo list because the FHIR Data segmentation for Privacy doesn't have a released version yet?</p>
<p>Example - <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/security-label-ds4p/StructureDefinition/extension-has-inline-sec-label">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/security-label-ds4p/StructureDefinition/extension-has-inline-sec-label</a></p>
<p>Any of the Structures: Extension Definitions URLs listed here <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/security-label-ds4p/2021Sep/artifacts.html#structures-extension-definitions">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/security-label-ds4p/2021Sep/artifacts.html#structures-extension-definitions</a> are also returning a 404.</p>

<p>Canonical urls SHOULD resolve (i.e. it's best practice), but they're not required to.  And there are all sorts of reasons why they might not.  (draft artifact, so not officially hosted yet; organization can't host content; organization that originally hosted has gone out of business/no longer owns domain name; etc.)  The typical way to retrieve resources with a canonical URL is first to look for them locally, then to look for them in whatever your preferred registry(ies) are, and then as a last resort to try resolving the canonical url.</p>

<p>so was it draft because it was just the ballot copy?</p>
