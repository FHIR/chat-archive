<p>Hi all, <br>
In a hospital doctors can become a team irrespective of patient. This representation of team is it necessary to use the care team with group or can we use Organization resource to represent as a team. which one is most commonly used?</p>

<p>Organization is a group that can take collective action and have shared responsibility.  Group can be a collective 'subject' of action, but not a collective performer and can't take shared responsibility.  Which is appropriate depends on the objective of grouping them into a 'team'</p>

<p>CareTeam is typically used when a team is specific to a Patient.  However, it can also be used for 'standing' teams when the team has a specific function and each member within the team takes on a particular role in delivering that function</p>

<p>This seems like a use for CareTeam, though right now there's no standard way to link that into a ResearchStudy.  You could use an extension.  You could also submit a change request asking us to explore adding a standard element or extension in the core spec</p>

<p>The research team is not caring for a particular patient. Hence, I am inclined to submit a change request asking the FHIR team to consider adapting the core profile of ResearchStudy to represent the members of the research team and the role of each member. Can you provide me with a link or instruction to submit such a change request?</p>

<p>There's a "propose a change" link at the bottom of each page in the spec.  Please note though that CareTeam doesn't need to be patient-specific.  CareTeam is already used for standing teams within institutions like a 'code team' that are completely patient independent.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion. Apart from the fact that there is no standard way to link a CareTeam to a ResearchStudy, CareTeam consists of Practitioners. A research team often has members that have nothing to do with patient care, such as secretary, database manager, statistician, financial officer, .... It would be great to have a generic  profile 'Team' that would be more general than CareTeam. This resource can then have members with a reference to Practitioner or Person. Profile Person should than also have a  0..* element 'role' or function. The elements 'contact' and 'principalInvestigator' in ResearchStudy could than be replaced with an element 'ResearchTeam' with a reference to profile Team.</p>

Patient - actual or potential recipient of care<br>
RelatedPerson - someone acting on behalf of the Patient based on their personal relationship<br>

<p>You can't <em>ever</em> have a reference to Person in FHIR.  Person is a linking resource only.  It's used to say that multiple Patients, Practitioners and/or RelatedPersons are the same human being (or animal).  Person can't ever be referenced as an actor or subject.</p>

<p>Thank you very much. I have indeed decided to use the reference to Practitioner. However, it would be great if the definition of CareTeam also allows for teams that do not provide care. Also, some members of a research team fulfill more than one role: e.g. principal investigator, contact person, and recruiter. This requires a cardinality of 0..* for participant.role</p>

<p>At the bottom of every page in the FHIR specification, there's a 'propose a change' link.  You'll need to do a 1-time registration process where we have a human review and confirm you seem to be a real human being.  After that, you can propose changes at will <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>
