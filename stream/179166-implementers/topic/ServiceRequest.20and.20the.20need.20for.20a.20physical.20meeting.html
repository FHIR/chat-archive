<p>We have a situation where patients are contacting their general practitioners through digital channels. We want to implement a triage solution to sort these inquiries. The triage solution will ask the patient several questions and should produce a PDF containing all the answers from the patient and a set of parameters. The parameters are level of urgency, the risk of communicable disease infection, and the need for a physical appointment (to take a blood sample for instance).</p>
<p>So far we've decided that ServiceRequest is the best fit for this.<br>
We will use the field Priority for the urgency level, DocumentReference for the PDF, and Condition for the risk of communicable disease.<br>
We're however unsure about how to represent the need for a physical appointment. </p>
<p>I was considering Observation because of this sentence: "Observation is intended for capturing measurements and subjective point-in-time assessments". To my mind, the need for a physical appointment could be considered a subjective point-in-time assessment, but I would like some feedback on this. Is this a reasonable use of the Observation resource? Is there perhaps another more fitting resource? Should we consider instead making an extension to ServiceRequest to express the need for a physical appointment?<br>
Any input would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Using an extension on ServiceRequest (something like a boolean isVirtual) would solve your issue.</p>
