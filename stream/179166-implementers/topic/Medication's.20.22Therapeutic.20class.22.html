<p>Is there a way to represent a medication's "therapeutic class", e.g. "Cardiovascular", "Analgesics", "Antibacterials", etc.   If not, is this something that should be balloted for R4 or is this better handled by the Pharmacy working group?</p>
<p>For an examples see the US "USP Therapeutic Model Guidelines" and the  AHFS "Pharmacologic Therapeutic Classification" here:</p>

<p>This has / is being discussed. Currently we are looking at product definitions, and there are two approaches: <br>
EntryDefinition is a definitional wrapper that can be used on Medications, and has a "classification" attribute.<br>
There are some open discussions around a "healthProduct" definitional resource, and a "medicationKnowledge".<br>
Also, BRR has a set of new resources where this could fit, but I can't find classification there. Only medicinalproductpharmaceutical.characteristics.</p>

<p>I assume that the "classification" can be also context-specific - i.e. one provider may have a classification, other provider a different classification. There are global or national classifications as you mention.</p>

<p>but directly answering your question, yes, there should be a solution, and entryDefinition.classification was made exactly to address this purpose. We may alter that, but that is afaik the attribute tat covers that.</p>

<p>HealthProduct is a discussion ogoing, to make life easier for implementers, esp when having to choose whether  a product is a device or a medicine - the standard should not be too prescriptive there.<br>
medicationKnowledge i think is also an ongoing discussion. They are independent resources.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194183">@John Silva</span> Pharmacy is considering a new medication related resource that we have tentatively called "MedicationKnowledge" where information such a therapeutic categories/classifications, and other types of knowledge could be included.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191393">@Igor Sirkovich</span> that is a choice, although classification is technically not a code - same product can have many classifications, there are surely many products with the same classification. And there are limitations to that (we've discussed a few here, such as when you have Aspirin and give it the code for Aspirin and also the code for ASA - you are describing Aspirin, not ASA. Aspirin can have a medication.manufacturer, but ASA does not have a manufacturer) <br>
This approach you have is sufficient for prescriptions but not for definition of the product.</p>

<p>Many products with the same classification doesn't mean it's not a code - it's just less granular.  Multiple applicable classifications is more of an issue as all coding repetitions are expected to be encoding the same concept, not describing different aspects of it.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span>  I'm really confused reading this by what you have in mind as "a classification." I'm going to assume you really mean "a category" to whit, you mean a grouper where multiple other drug concepts in this case are considered "in the group." Usually that means "is-a" but in this case it might also mean "is contained in" (such as Aspirin-containing medication.) Whatever the "grouper/class" is, would be a terminology concept from a code system (essentially like those you listed above) and they would be represented by a code from the code system. So you'd use FHIR datatype coding to capture it when you want to include it with a medication. Keep in mind that doing so is in essence an point in time view of a grouper (class) for that medication. Am I following what you are asking for?</p>

<p>I'm glad this topic has generated some discussion.   My intent (or need) is to have a mechanism to describe the taxonomy of drugs, as the USP and AHSF groups do.   An Aspirin is a type of analgesic; I suppose it could also be considered a 'neural agent' (not knowing about the multi-axial nature of drug classifications).    My basic question was about what to use in the Medication resource since I didn't see any (obvious) way to do this.  Jose's mention of using EntryDefinition I suppose would be very useful because it could be used to represent the same drug in multiple classifications (places in the taxonomy).   For simplicity's sake it would be simpler for my use case to have a category property on Medication.  (I'm not sure I understand why the additional complications are needed but of course there are probably many other use cases out there beside the simpler example I have.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194183">@John Silva</span> Yes, if you use medication resource to define the medicine, you could have a medication.classification (i.e. "i'm declaring that aspirin is an analgesic, an antiplatelet...")</p>

<p>if you use medication to specify what you are ordering/delivering, you can also use medication.classification, but it have different values (i.e. "i am prescribing aspirin, and I am stating it is an analgesic, so please substitute accordingly if you need to - meaning, don't substitute for an antiplatelet because i am only referring to the analgesic class").<br>
I hope this differentiation between "defining a product" and "specifying a product" is useful - it is not obvious and it is a thought aid, but has helped me a lot since I learned it.</p>

If you want to do something like what Jose suggested, then the information should be derived from what the prescriber put into the ReasonCode in the MedicationStatement. Perhaps that could be influenced by classification information available from a drug information database, or from the "MedicationKnowledge" resource. But I'm concerned you want to support anyone to insert whatever class concept they want on a medication resource in some server. Not vetted, not good.</p>

<p>so, going back to the (simple) question: <br>
1. There is no way to handle classification in medication resource.<br>
2. When you want to do that, i advise to clarify if you are defining the medication (as in a catalog or drug database) or conveying additional info in the prescription to support identification.</p>

<p>"narcotic" medically always means the same thing.  "narcotic" as used in regulation can vary by jurisdiction.  whether or not a product is specifically noted as a "narcotic" in the order, it is still a "narcotic" - there may be clinical considerations for that order AND there may be procedural/regulatory considerations for the order.</p>

"narcotic" as used in regulation can vary by jurisdiction.  whether or not a product is specifically noted as a "narcotic" in the order, it is still a "narcotic" - there may be clinical considerations for that order AND there may be procedural/regulatory considerations for the order.</p>
<p>I agree that this particular "sub-thread" has diverged from the original question.  There is work going on which should address this capability</p>

<p>Agree, Scott. Just an example of classifications. We can consider "distribution Class", "price class"... all of which can have their interest. The idea is that a) you do not want to send the entire product definition over the wire  and b) you may not be able to guarantee that the receiver shares the same data set as the prescriber, so you want to send some additional attributes on the drug.</p>

<p>BTW, I was asked for recommendation on a medicines database  / "terminology" and to me the only solution that would work is the one on Catalog. But i look forward to see what is "medicationKnowledge" when it is available - and hope it is aligned with BRR resources and catalogs. Pharmacies do not define most of the drug knowledge, manufacturers and regulators do.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span> The use case we have is related to representing and sharing what I call "drug information" and is often maintained by drug knowledge base vendors such as First DataBank or Multum.  Pharmacy has separated this out of a medication that you would prescribe or dispense as it can contain more information such as classifications, etc.  Lots of discussion still to take place and meetings/quarters are scheduled in New Orleans</p>

<p>One of the issues I pick up on in this conversation (sorry I'm late to it) is that there are defining characteristics of a medication that are always true, then there are contextual characteristics. Classifications (depending upon what you mean when you are talking about them) get into this space, and this is where the "is-a" hierarchical relationships get difficult.</p>
<p>So a drug may contain an ingredient and that is defining of that drug, and always true, but depending upon the context/dose/etc it may be performing a different role - there are many drugs that can perform different roles. The fact that a drug can perform one of these roles means it has that "disposition", but because it has that disposition doesn't mean it will be used in that role. Then there's the regulation which licences the drugs to be used for certain purposes (in certain roles)</p>
<p>One thing that has been useful to distinguish in the SNOMED CT drug modelling discussions the difference between the following properties of a drug<br>
 - defining characteristics (like its ingredient or form)<br>
 - the disposition/s it has because of those defining characteristics (its potential uses)<br>
 - the role/s it is performing in a particular event</p>
<p>For example petrol is a substance we can define chemically, it has the disposition of being flammable or being a solvent, and when I'm driving my car I'm using its flammable disposition to use it in the role of being a fuel.</p>
<p>Understanding that these properties have different characteristics and temporality is useful to consider where those properties should be modelled.</p>
<p>Personally I like the idea of scoping Medication resources to be a pure statement of what the medication is (the defining characteristics) and separating out <br>
 - what the medication could potentially be used for or may interact with (like MedicationKnowledge for disposition) <br>
 - what the medication is licensed for in any particular realm at any given time (regulatory information)<br>
 - what the medication is being used for (or intended to be) in a specific encounter (role)</p>

<p>We all have to keep the distinction between the Catalog resource and its Catalog entries versus the things that are referenced in that Catalog.  If I am creating a Catalog of Medication resources, say to represent my jurisdictional formulary with costs and such, I would <em>NOT</em> necessarily use the Catalog classifications to represent the Drug classes.  I would use the Catalog classifications for however I am grouping the medications in my formulary.  I would <em>ALWAYS</em> use the MedicationKnowledge resource's means for identifying the various medication classes we have - such as ATC class, Allergen Groupings, etc.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> Here is the statement on the Catalog profile:  "The Definitional resources contain static, immutable attributes. The Catalog provides the curated, approved and context-specific attributes and relations."  That seems rather clear to me.  The inherent relationships of a medication to its drug class, a branded product to its generic formulations, etc. are all "static immutable attributes" of the medication and so that seems to be out-of-scope for the Catalog and the Catalog entries.</p>

<p>BTW, the Pharmacy WG is proposing the MedicationKnowledge resource as the foundational resource for formularies, drug catalogs, and other knowledge bases.

<p>I'm relatively certain that there won't end up being a "Catalogue" resource or any other resources that are catalogue-specific.  Instead, we'll end up with patterns.  The reason is that "catalogues" are just publication mechanisms for information that's defined and used elsewhere.  There's no piece of information that only exists in the context of a catalogue.  Price, insurance coverage, relationships between products, etc. all need to be shared and maintained in situations where no catalogue exists or will ever exist.  And the introduction of a catalogue can't change where those data elements are defined.  All a catalogue can do is take a particular subset of interrelated resources and publishe them together - i.e. as a document.</p>
