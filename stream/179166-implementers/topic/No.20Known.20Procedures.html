<p>We are trying to determine the correct location to include "No Known Procedures" (SNOMED 787480003).  We know that "No Known Problems" goes into Condition and "No Known Allergies" goes into AllergyIntolerance but there is no mention of "No Known Procedures" for the Procedure resource.  Would the proper location for "No Known Procedures" be the Procedure resource or a different resource (e.g. Observation)?</p>
