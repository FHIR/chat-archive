<p>Wanted to gut-check this. We're looking to represent provider star ratings (e.g. 5/5 stars) in FHIR and was not entirely sure which resource would be appropriate. It seems like Measure would make sense despite it's focus on quality reporting, whereas star ratings are more of a patient-oriented measure/score. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>a measure would capture that reasoning for the star, but I would think a Flag would capture the actual star</p>
