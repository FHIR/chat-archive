<p>To say "take until further notice" would I use timing.repeat.boundsPeriod with a start and no end?<br>
What does it mean if boundsPeriod is not present at all?</p>

<p>Yes, that is how we do it.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>To us that means: you don't know when it started, but the intention is to keep using it until further notice. </p>
<p>Although I must say: we defined an extension for usage period, since conceptually in The Netherlands the usage period belongs to the medication request as a whole and not to one dosage instruction (since there may be more than one dosage instruction in a medication request, we don't want our implementers to calculate the overarching usage period from the dosage instructions).  </p>
<p>There may of course also be a usage duration for each dosage instruction. For example in the case of a schedule for building-up medication: we then also use sequence for ordering those instructions. We don't work with start/end date in the dosage instruction, only sequence and duration.</p>
