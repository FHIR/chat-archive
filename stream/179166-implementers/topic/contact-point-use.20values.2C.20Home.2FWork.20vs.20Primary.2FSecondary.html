<p>contact-point-use values in telecom currently are listed in the standard as: home/work/temp/old/mobile.</p>
<p>In the modern age of mobile phones, homes without landlines, shift work, work-from-home, etc... I have found this concept to be somewhat antiquated, especially when referencing patients for the purpose of contacting them over phone.</p>
<p>For example, my mobile phone is actually my primary phone, that is what i want people to contact me on. The caller doesn't need to know that it's my cell or work or home designation, just that it's the main number to get a hold of me on. </p>
<p>For these reason, when talking about phone, we currently use Primary/Secondary instead of home/work. </p>
<p>Has there been any consideration to this kind of approach for contact-point-use? If I want to use primary/secondary in my application instead of home/work/etc... how do I accommodate that?</p>

<p>Note: The spec also says that it is REQUIRED to use this value set.</p>

<p>The notion is that different types of numbers get used in different ways.  You call a mobile number if its something urgent and you want to get hold of someone wherever they are.  Similarly calling a work number would be appropriate in some cases, but not in other cases.  The purpose of the element is to help the user evaluate which of the available numbers to call for a given use.  It's certainly possible that the same number could be captured as both a "home" and a "mobile" number if the intention is that that number be used for either use.</p>

<p>You're free to add an extension that captures primary/secondary and not populate use at all if that's what makes sense in your environment - keeping in mind that many systems won't recognize your extension.</p>
