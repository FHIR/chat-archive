<p>Medication is related with other "stuff":<br>
- with other <strong>medications</strong> (interactions)<br>
- with conditions<br>
  - <strong>indications</strong><br>
  - <strong>contraindications</strong> <br>
- with other <strong>products</strong> such as grapefruitjuice or liquorice<br>
- with <strong>things</strong> like driving<br>
- other things?</p>
<p>1. Do we want to treat these somewhat consistenly?<br>
2. Doesn't the same or similar apply to other products?</p>

<p>The general rule with REST is that those things that are generally created before are pointed to by those things that are generally created after. Thus one doesn't need to do an update to an existing resource for normal workflow creation of things that are known to be created later.    <br>
Other than this principle, what were you thinking of as "treat these somewhat consistently?"</p>

<p>I links to other medications and products would typically be by code - so whether they have records or not doesn't really matter.</p>

<p>just realized, this should be in committers... sorry...<br>
Question is more "is a indication and a contraindication something that we can expect to be consistent across resources"?<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> , your answer triggers another question: "by code" is it: a reference to a resource? A codeableConcept?</p>

<p>I think CodeableConcept is going to be more likely than Reference.  Reference only works if the knowledge source knows the URL for the artifact on the server.  CodeableConcept will work so long as there's an agreed terminology - which is much more likely.</p>

<p>ok. and we could expect behaviour that for all of the relations i mentioned, right? <br>
- indications and contraindications , interaction with food, activities?</p>

<p>I think so.</p>
