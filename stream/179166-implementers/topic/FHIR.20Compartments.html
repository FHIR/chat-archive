<p>Regarding compartments in FHIR.  Is it a deliberate design not to have compartments for write operations, i.e., HTTP verbs such as PUT and POST?</p>
<p>Are there any plans to support compartments for write operations?</p>
<p>At DXC we have implemented the patient compartment for GET operations.  But when we started implementing PUT and POST we could not find any guidance in STU3.</p>
<p>How do we avoid two routes of execution for a resource that this in a compartment that has write operations such PUT and POST?  There would be a route for the Query operation of GET and another route for the write operations.</p>
<p>Your experience and advice is appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Will</p>

<p>well, the existence of the compartment short cuts is controversial. Argonaut won't be supporting them, for instance.</p>

<p>they are not actually supported for read - as in, there is only one id for a resource. Put and Post are not described for the same reason. compartment are a search syntax, not an alternative identifier</p>

<p>I thought the answer wouldn't be straight forward.  :) So compartments should only be used for searching syntax?  </p>
