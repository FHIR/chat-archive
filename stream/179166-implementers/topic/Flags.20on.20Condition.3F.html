<p>How would you flag a condition so the GP/MD's attention is draw more towards some Conditions in a longer list? It's missing from the Flag/subject list of References. At the very least we feel Condition should have been in there, but in general you could say that you could Flag anything, so opening the Flag.subject up for "any" resource would hten be reasonable. Did we miss something or shall I open a tracker for this?</p>

<p>Generally the "please pay attention to these ones" is handled via a List - because the ones that are "important" for the cardiologist aren't necessarily the ones that are important to their psychiatrist or dentist.  With List, you can have filtered views for each context.</p>
