<p>I'm new here, just wanted to say hello. Our organization has just started working on a FHIR/API based HIE to connect hospitals around the world with US based healthcare organizations and professions looking to provide charity consults, assessments, and care plans to underserved people around the world. We're working to start  a pilot with some hospitals in Kenya, American Samoa, and China. In addition to the HIE, we've got a telemedicine solution and lightweight web based EHR for organizations that want an easy way to integrate.<br>
