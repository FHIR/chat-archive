<p>I'm working on implementing a transaction with multiple create interactions. I'm wondering how to link resources in the transaction.</p>
<p>I'm trying to create a DocumentReference with a Binary. Both new. The 'create' interaction description (in the HTTP section) clearly states that the resources should not have ids, as these will be assigned by the server. However, how would I link to the Binary resource from the DocumentReference resource if I do not yet have an id for the Binary resource?</p>
<p>Is there any provision in FHIR for this?</p>
<p>BTW: This is within the scope of IHE MHD. In IHE XDS there is a provision that the source can use temporary ids, which will be reassigned to actual ids once created. Does FHIR have something similar?</p>

<p>Hi Rick, they cannot have id's, but the Bundle.entry which contains the resource CAN have a fullUrl element. If you make this a uri, other resources can reference the to-be-created resource by this uri, and the server will resolve and update such references while processing the batch.  See <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/bundle-transaction.xml.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/bundle-transaction.xml.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/bundle-transaction.xml.html</a> for an example of such a fullUrl.</p>

<p>Thanks. That makes sense. I will submit a request to IHE to include a statement like this in the MHD profile for the ITI-65 Provide Document Bundle transaction (which is in ready-for-trial-implementation state), as it was not immediately clear to me.</p>
