<p>My understanding is that when there is a create operation, the logical id of the resource is not populated and if it is, it is considered wrong (though servers often choose to ignore the logical id and just make their own). However, in the transaction Bundle example <a href="http://build.fhir.org/bundle-transaction.json.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/bundle-transaction.json.html">http://build.fhir.org/bundle-transaction.json.html</a> the logical id is populated with "bundle-transaction". As I understand it the transaction Bundle is a create. Is it wrong to have a logical id or is it allowed and just ignored?<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  is this something you can answer? ... is the referenced example on the FHIR pages correct?</p>

<p>It is allowed, because you may be reading a bundle from one server, and turning around and posting it as a transaction to another server. The second server rewrites IDs as necessary and retains referential integrity across resources within the bundle.
