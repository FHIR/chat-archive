<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm growing concerned about some of the codes that are in the UCUM valueset. I've already found a few codes that are invalid (I'm eventually going to run all codes in the valueset through <a href="https://ucum.nlm.nih.gov/ucum-lhc/demo.html" target="_blank" title="https://ucum.nlm.nih.gov/ucum-lhc/demo.html">https://ucum.nlm.nih.gov/ucum-lhc/demo.html</a> and submit the broken ones in a tracker item), but I am also concerned about some of the curly bracket codes (annotations) in the valueset. </p>
<p>Codes such as {2 or 3 times}/d are problematic, because, according to ucum: An annotation without a leading symbol implies the default unit 1 (the unity)</p>
<p>If the annotation is resolved to 1, then {2 or 3 times}/d will end up being interpreted as 1/d, which seems problematic. I'm thinking any use of annotations that have a numeric value other than 1 should be avoided.</p>
<p>Am I correct to be concerned about these codes?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>yes you are right to be concerned. Please let us know about such issues in tasks. Probably good to have different tasks for different kinds of problems. But I did think I had validated all the ucum codes  for technical correctness</p>

<p>The {2 or 3 times}/d is technically correct - but semantically wrong.  We should probably flag all codes that have {} in them - as a rule, we should avoid those in most cases</p>

<p>one question is what the purpose of the common ucum value set is - terminology servers / systems that don't support the grammar are using it as a proxy, which is why it's leaning towards comprehensiveness. (and you might think that this should be uncommon, but no.......)</p>

<p>I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  that {} codes should be avoided whenever possible, however, I can see how keeping the context the annotations (curly brace codes} provide is useful. For example, {doses}/day and {times}/day both resolve to 1/day. But a system which recognizes them as individual codes can leverage the distinction. I don't know if that's technically correct, but might be a reality for systems migrating from another unit code system, such as snomed, to be compliant with FHIR.</p>
<p>I believe this case should be expressed as {times}/day and the quantity should be expressed elsewhere.</p>

<p>Thinking aloud - it's possible this is due directly to the migration from snomed. See snomed code 396112008|Three to four times a day (qualifier value). <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  what would be the best way to model such a code with ucum? Or is that the wrong question? Should ucums even be used for such use cases?</p>

<p>The 3-4 /day would be handled using  Range data type.  So it would be 3 1/d - 4 1/d where both the low and the high would have the 1/d unit.  Our examples should only use brackets where it's essential to interpretation.  E.g . mm{Hg}</p>
