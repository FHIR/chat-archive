<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Looking at the the reference type attribute ServiceRequest.subject i wonder why there are not more alternatives to reference then (Patient|Group|Location|Device) ?. For example cant the subject of an ServiceRequest reasonably be a Practitioner or an Organization?</p>
<p>In my specific case im thinking of an workflow where a clinical system or an organization issues one or several ServiceRequest's with a reference to a PlanDefinition containing a number of Questionnaires(set of questions) that a Patient, Practitioner or a RelatedPerson should fill out.  In this case cant one argue that the subject of a ServiceRequest could and should be able to be a Practitioner or Organization? Since the Questionnaires to be filled out is ordered for the Practitioner or the Organization that wants to know the Patient thougths about their last visit etc. The Patient is just the performer, not the subject.</p>
<p>For example QuestionnaireResponse has subject Reference(Any), why is this not also applied on ServiceRequest?</p>

<p>If you want a Practitioner to fill out a questionnaire, the Practitioner would be the intended performer of the ServiceRequest, not the subject.  A Practitioner being the <em>subject</em> of a ServiceRequest would mean that the Practitioner is the one to be observed, be the subject a procedure is performed on, etc.  And so far, we haven't seen that as something that's supported by most systems that support ServiceRequest.</p>
