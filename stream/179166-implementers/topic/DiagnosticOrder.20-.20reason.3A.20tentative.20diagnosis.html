<p>how would you model a tenative diagnosis as a reason for a (lab) diagnosticOrder? DiagnosticOrder.reason or supportingInformation with an Condition with verificationStatus: provisional? Reason seems more intuitive to me. ICD10 GM provides to ability to just add an V (Verdacht = suspicion) to every code. I don't think this is possible with ICD10 WHO?</p>

<p>If you want to say "this is why", you would use DiagnosticOrder.reason.  Many resources allow that to be a choice of CodeableConcept or Reference(Condition), but I think OO decided that wasn't terribly common in the diagnostics space.  SupportingInformation is intended to convey information that's needed in order to perform the observation.  E.g. patient weight, pregnancy status, liver function or other things the lab or observation peformer needs to know in order to perform the test</p>

<p><code>DiagnosticRequest.reason</code>  is indeed the justifcation for the test.  Whether the reason is confirmed or provisional is not defined.  AS you suggest the concept code could say that or an extension for a reference to condition.   OO could consider adding a reference or a standard extension if you would like to make a tracker.</p>
