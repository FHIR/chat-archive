<p>Many FHIR resources such as Care Plan, Procedure Request, Medication Request are complex structures which refer to other complex structures. Many times these reference relationships may be recursive.</p>
<p>At some point a clinician or operator would need to enter this data. For example a doctor is expected to add/modify a Procedure Request.  </p>
<p>I am finding creating a User Interface to create such structure at best mind boggling. Are there projects which have created Java Script libraries to make this process easier. I am looking for best ways to create Web application to input these complex FHIR resources.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that you don't generally design user interfaces based on FHIR's expressive capabilities, you design user interfaces based on what your system is supposed to expose - which will be a subset of the data elements and relationships the resource supports (and perhaps a few extensions too).  References and CodeableConcepts will often be handled via drop-downs or look-up windows.  So it's not as daunting as it may first appear.</p>

<p>You may want to look at the Clinical Meteor project, which is a fork of the Meteor.js web framework.  We've been adding FHIR libraries and have a lot of the CRUD UI built out.</p>

<p>There's also the SMART on FHIR project, but they seem more interested in getting FHIR objects onto diverse platforms; rather than creating a FHIR App Framework.</p>

<p>The FHIR App Framework ... what language / base would this be constructed under; just curious if there is some movement here, might be interested in contributing.</p>

<p>It's all built on Javascript/Node (which is technically now referred to as Ecmascript, I suppose).  Primary environment is the V8 interpreter, so Node/Chrome/Mongo.  It's basically a ChromeOS, with a custom FHIR datalayer based off the Meteor.js build pipeline and architecture.  We use React.js for frontend rendering.</p>

<p>Interesting.  Yes, my team just got deep into React.js via Node (ES 6) and I have dove into React Native for mobile.  Wasn't sure Node was still a big deal, seems like it is.  Where is the Git repo ?</p>
