<p>Hi, can you please make some recommendation how MedicationRequest resource can be used to represent both dosage and dispense information, assuming that the requirement is that the dispense information is potentially split into number of different size vials. <br>
We are currently thinking to use dosageInstruction field for dosage (prescribed dosage), which works good.<br>
For dispense information we were planning to use dispenseRequest field on MedicationRequest, but it's a 0..1 element and there is no good placeholder for vial size (there is only quantity which could indicate number of vials), so now I'm thinking I should be using MedicationDispense, which would be related to MedicationRequest via authorizingPrescription field.</p>
<p>Is there a better way to do that?</p>
<p>In MedicationDispense to represent number of different size vials which are used to fulfill the prescription I would need to have multiple MedicationDispense records - each for one vial size, vial size would be defined in dosageInstruction on MedicationDispense and number of those vials would be represented in quantity field. Is there a good way to relate those MedicationDispense records to each other (as they are part of single prescription)? Or would referring to single MedicationRequest suffice?</p>
<p>Please let me know your thoughts.</p>
<p>The example prescription which I would like to represent is in the attached image. <a href="/user_uploads/10155/U2TfxY-opSBMP15wuSe29JeB/image-9.png">image-9.png</a></p>

<p>The medicationdispense resource can reference the medicationrequest through the authorizingPrescription field. As for the actual dispense, I'd reference a medication resource with the attributes. In this case, if it's two medications (or one medication with multiple dosages), I think it would make sense to have two medicationdispenses, each with their own medication (describing the vials)</p>

<p>I assume that the "dispense in 2 vials" is information to the dispenser on the original order?  If so, it needs to be in the MedicationRequest.  You can use the dosage to represent the dose and include dispense information in the MedicationRequest.dispenseRequest.  You will likely have to use the "dispenserInstruction" for that which is a note and give the quantity in the dispenseRequest.  You can't use MedicationDispense as that is what was dispensed and not what is ordered.</p>

<p>thanks Melva, the problem is that MedicationRequest.dispenseRequest cardinality is 0..1 so I don't know how to describe to the dispenser that I need for example 2 vials 200mg and 2 vials 500mg</p>

<p>What do you put in medication[x]? <br>
Are you prescribing by vial or by amount? </p>
<p>If you prescribe by vial and have two vial sizes, you will need two instances of MedicationDispense. Unless you have a code for "1 vial of 200ml together with 1 vial of 500ml".</p>

<p>If the code you have is for the drug with no information about vials, you could rely on the dispenser making a good choice based on the dosage information and a knowledge of the available vial sizes.</p>
<p>Or you could use note.</p>

<p>you should not use Dispense to represent "what shall be dispensed". the FHIR resource for "dispense request" or "dispense instructions" is the medicationrequest. I think the dispenserequest could be split from the medicationrequest, but if not, a cardinality change 0..* could be justified in this case.</p>

<p>I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191682">@Richard Townley-O'Neill</span> it would be 2 MedicationRequests if you need to prescribe 2 different vial sizes, but in my experience prescriptions are not written at that level of specificity.

<p>I presume this would be a prescription after some "encoding" - indeed the prescriber will not usually enter that level of detail (sometimes they may) but there would be a different step to determine which products in detail would be adequate to fulfil the prescription. In most cases, though, this is not done explicitly.</p>

<p>One of the questions is whether you can suspend or cancel the prescription for one vial without making the same state change to both.  If the answer is 'no', then you'd have to wrap the MedicationRequests in RequestGroup.</p>

<p>we are working on the current version of FHIR 4.0.1, so there is no DispenserInstruction attribute available for us, we are capturing both dosage and dispense details on our enrollment form so requester is actually required to provide us the level of specificity up to a number of specific vials.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> , yes, if we'll go with multiple MedicationRequest approach then we would need to use Request group, but maybe I'll consider the DispenserInstruction field as an extension instead, or think about other extensions to cover my scenario. Introducing multiple MedicationRequests for different vial sizes, but for the same actual prescription (attribute dosageInstruction) will be confusing, and also in dispenseRequest attribute right now I don't have any place to store the actual vial size, only the quantity</p>

<p>The Netherlands have chosen for a model to separate therapeutic information from logistic information, having separate profiles / resource instances for what we call 'medication agreement' (prescriber therapeutic information in FHIR Resource MedicationRequest), 'dispense request' (prescriber logistic information in MedicationRequest), 'administration agreement' (pharmacist therapeutic information from FHIR resource MedicationDispense), 'medication dispense' (pharmacist logistic information from FHIR resource MedicationDispense). <br>
Separating therapeutic and logistic information has many advantages and makes it so much easier to track relevant changes in the medication treatment (which should be free of logistic information / not be clogged by the much more dynamic logistic information).</p>

<p>The above discussion shows the utility of that approach: I think if "DispenseRequest" is covered by MedicationRequest, this should be profiled as such - we may not need a new resource for DispenseRequest, but the MedicationRequest should be in a form that can be profiled for that</p>

<p>Hi All, I have another question related to MedicationRequest.Dosage resource - can someone share with me some example or reference where dosageInstruction.doseAndRate would contain more than one element in the array? I'm wondering why cardinality of doseAndRate is 0..* instead of 0..1 - all the examples from here <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medicationrequest-examples.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medicationrequest-examples.html</a> seem to have only single element in doseAndRate array.</p>
<p>Multiple dosages are possible by using sequence counter in Dosage, but the individual Dosages seem to always have only one doseAndRate.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
