<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm implementing FHIR at the moment and I'm having trouble dealing with appointment reasons.</p>
<p>I know I can use the value set available here : <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-encounter-reason.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-encounter-reason.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-encounter-reason.html</a></p>
<p>or implement my own value set for it but it's still problematic because reasons are a resource in my app and practitioners can add, modify and delete them. Reasons also have various fields such as a color, ...</p>
<p>A value set won't be enough for my app.</p>
<p>A "reason" in my app is a visit motive or an appointment motive (visit and appointment are the same thing here). Sure, my visit motive is linked to my appointment but it is also a standalone resource in my app because you can CRUD it. A value set doesn't allow me to do all these actions on my visit motives that is why I can't use one and why I'm asking to create a "new resourceType". Here is the schema of my "visitMotive" a.k.a reason : <a href="http://pastebin.com/nECvfxqh" target="_blank" title="http://pastebin.com/nECvfxqh">pastebin.com/nECvfxqh</a> </p>
<p>I've started a post on StackOverflow for this matter and already talked with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> about it. I've discovered this chat just after, sorry for reposting here, I think it could be useful to others too. Here is the link to the question : <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42108964/fhir-appointment-reasons-as-a-resource/42115655?noredirect=1#comment71611388_42115655" target="_blank" title="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42108964/fhir-appointment-reasons-as-a-resource/42115655?noredirect=1#comment71611388_42115655">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42108964/fhir-appointment-reasons-as-a-resource/42115655?noredirect=1#comment71611388_42115655</a></p>
<p>Do you have any hints / ideas on how could I implement such thing ?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Thomas</p>

<p>Some further background - the notion of "reason" here is more like a definition for a type of service to be provided and has a name, expected duration, type of specialty, etc.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191367">@Brian Postlethwaite</span>, any thoughts?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191367">@Brian Postlethwaite</span>, can you advise if a new resource could be envisioned to answer Thomas's question. Being involved in the same project, we would need to decide to create a new resource aligned with a future change or keep it project specific... Or shall we make a GForge tracker for this request?</p>
