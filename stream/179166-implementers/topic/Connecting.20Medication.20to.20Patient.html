<blockquote>
<p>I have one doubt regarding the Mapping between resources.<br>
There is a resource named as Medication, how it is related to the patient. There is no reference in the document. How can I fetch Medication against the Patient?<br>
I am using PatientEverything API for fetching all the resources against the patient.<br>
Can you please help me for the same as soon as possible because I am stuck in that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like a question well suited on the implementer stream. The short answer is that Medication connects to Patient  through MedicationRequest, MedicationDispense, MedicationAdministration and/or MedicationStatement, never directly. Medication is the description of a drug regardless of a patient or doctor.</p>
<p>The question "what's the medication list for this patient" is thus answered by looking at what a Patient <em>should</em> be using based on MedicationRequest, what he <em>could</em> be using based on MedicationDispense, what he <em>definitively has</em> been using based on MedicationAdministration and what is <em>stated</em> he uses based on MedicationStatement.</p>

<p>..or the answers in a  QuestionnaireResponse, which preferrably has been translated into a series of MedicationStatement(R4)/MedicationUse(R5) resources.</p>
