<p>I'm looking but can not find any reference to a Payor Pre-Authorization.<br>
I would expect it to be at the Account.Coverage.payor level<br>
This when Aetna, for example, would say "we authorize payment for three visits for Patient X, etc "<br>
Any help?<br>
Thanks</p>

<p>Claim covers actual claims as well as pre-authorizations and pre-determinations</p>

A pre-authorization is a use on the Claim Resource which represents a claim, preauthorization or a predetermination. Please see the Claim and ClaimResponse as well as examples and join the Financial Management WG calls, Tuesday at 11 Eastern for discussions.</p>

<p>Ok, I think I understand now. I was thinking of Claim as only a request for reimbursement.</p>

<p>The name is a little misleading.  However, we've had trouble coming up with a better name that would be better understood.  Suggestions welcome :)</p>
