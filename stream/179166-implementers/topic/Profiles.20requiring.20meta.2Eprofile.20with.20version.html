<p>Are there reasons why an IG's profiles shouldn't require conforming instances to include a canonical uri with version in meta.profile?<br>
I am pretty clear on the pros, particularly when dealing with breaking changes across profile versions. I was wondering why it might be a bad idea to require such a thing.</p>

<p>I think the biggest 'con' is in compatibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if there are no breaking changes between version <code>current</code> and <code>next</code>, implementers will be forced to explicitly upgrade.</li>
<li>Given the distributed nature of the systems, it means that implementers will have to put in discovery and selection around 'n' versions even if all the underlying code is the same (e.g., I've added v2, but I have apps that haven't been updated from v1).</li>
<li>In my experience, knowing that each version must be explicitly enabled lowers the bar for backwards-compatibility (e.g., someone has to opt into this new version, so it's fine if we break 'xyz').</li>
</ul>
<p>(note, I understand there are pros as well - but you asked only for cons =)</p>

<p>In general, the challenge with IGs requiring instance data to populate <code>meta.profile</code> is a semantic one: applications might start out using that field <strong>as a proxy for information that exists in the resource</strong> and then over time start <strong>attaching additional meaning purely to the presence of the _profile value</strong>.</p>

<p>Huh. Wish I'd noticed this during ballot -- feels like a mistake. And on review: technically I think the <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/StructureDefinition-C4BB-ExplanationOfBenefit-definitions.html#ExplanationOfBenefit.meta.profile">CARIN IG only says </a> that <code>.meta.profile</code> needs to be populated, and doesn't say <em>with what</em>. So formally this is a very strange requirement indeed, and almost certainly doesn't reflect intent or good practice.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what "CPCDS data element (190)" is, and after downloading a Word Doc from <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/Common_Payer_Consumer_Data_Set.html#common-payer-consumer-data-set">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/Common_Payer_Consumer_Data_Set.html#common-payer-consumer-data-set</a> I see it doesn't add anything to the definition (element 190 is defined five times in that doc, but doesn't provide any details that aren't already in the FHIR structure definition I linked to above).</p>

<p>This is for CARIN BB. Version STU1 (1.0.0) required meta.profile, but did not specify what it had to be populated with. That requirement by itself is not overly helpful. </p>
<ul>
<li>There is a proposal now to explicitly require the inclusion of the appropriate CARIN BB profile (<a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30375">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30375</a>).</li>
<li>During the FM call today, a request was made to require version as well to meta.profile.</li>
<li>These are trial use standards versions and STU2 will unfortunately not be backwards compatible with STU1.</li>
</ul>
<p>A decision on regarding this has not been made yet, but will be discussed on Feb. 25 on the CARIN project call at 11am Eastern with a possible vote on the FM call on March 2nd. I am trying to gather data and opinions to bring to the calls.</p>

<p>Requiring population of profile is generally bad practice.  It increases the cost of interoperability and runs the risk of people using it to infer meaning.  Why does BlueButton want the profile declared?</p>

<p>I have to say I don't understand this guidance either. </p>
<p>I can't fathom how requiring a profile declaration could "increase the cost of interoperability", and people using it to infer meaning is a good thing. A profile tag is an explicit declaration of the purpose for which the resource was created and how artifacts like validators should treat it.</p>
<p>This feels to me like guidance that makes things harder for actual implementers for the nebulous benefit of "modelling purity"</p>

<p>Generally I don't think declaring conformance to a profile helps much, "Look guys I state I conformance to X (but I really don't due to missing Y)." <br>
Profile (CCDA template ids) should never contribute to clinical decisions.<br>
Definitions of attributes should never change, ".billablePeriod means X with profile Yv1, but means Z with Yv2".<br>
Given that what does having a profile tag really tell you? By itself does it prove that the resource conforms to the profile.. No. Does it provide meaning to the data... No. Does it provide bloat to the resource (very light clinical Observation, conforms to 5 profiles, the profile data would be more than the obs data)... Yes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the CARIN case, how do you know if the EOB is an inpatient institutional vs an outpatient institutional? You look at the profile. That's the only way to know. But it does help with validation (provides meaning), if the profile is inpatient then the validator can say "requires admission date".</p>
<p>Assuming the profile values being populated, gleaned from the examples, are the actual profile values expected, which aren't in the conformance rules (as noted by Josh).</p>
<p>I would have expected that either the EoB.type value set would have had 2 values (OUT, INP) rather than just one (institutional) OR there was a supporting info slot that split that attribute.</p>
<p>Thus the validator could say, "EOB declares type = inp, but missing mandatory admission period." Instead of, "EoB has profile =INP but missing admission period." That way all(?) the validation would be based on data not conformance statements.</p>
<p>Does that help with V2, V3... Probably not. Is it important for validators not to complain about not meeting V2 rules when the author didn't intend for the resource to conform V2?</p>

<p>If <code>meta.profile</code> is the only way an IG provides to convey the meaning of a resource (e.g., which type of EoB the resource represents), this feature is being misused in the IG, especially when existing data elements like <code>type</code>/<code>subtype</code> are available.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>  Hmm.. I mean thinking this through obviously using <code>meta.profile</code> as a surrogate for <code>type</code>/<code>subtype</code> seems bad. Clearly if someone is trying to convey a data categorization they should use the fields that are there to satisfy that need (and I see that the CARIN IG profiles don't appear to use the subtype element, this would be a nice thing to fix in a future revision).</p>
<p>I think what gets my hackles up is the suggestion that IGs shouldn't be allowed to require profile declarations, which suggests that they shouldn't be using them. Profile declarations are really useful things for the infrastructure, and I bet that will only intensify when we get to a world where organizations like the payors are required to implement a whole suite of IGs that aren't always mutually compatible and sometimes mandate data for one audience that isn't appropriate for another.</p>
<p>Personally I think the guidance should be that IGs should always require profile declarations (to keep things manageable for the tooling) and that if the profile implies any meaning, the meaning should be conveyed by a fixed value enforced by the profile (e.g. a fixed subtype in the CARIN example).</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>It must always be possible to strip a profile declaration and re-identify what profile(s) the instance is valid against by just checking it against the candidates.  If you can't do that, then the profile contains 'extra' information and the implementation is non-conformant.  If a profile declaration has any meaning other than "this instance will validate against profile X", that additional meaning <em>must</em> be expressed in some other way (typically by adding an extension).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The valid rationale for declaring an extension in an instance is to allow for more efficient validation by the recipient.  If you know what a profile claims to be valid against, you can check that instance more efficiently than if you need to check against all possible candidates.  However, in practice, there are generally discriminators that allow you to quickly choose a relatively small pool of profiles to evaluate against.  (e.g. if I was trying to decide what US Core profile to check an instance against, I'd check resource type and category).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receivers <em>should</em> check instances for profile validity regardless of declaration (unless you're super brave or have really rigorous conformance testing and strict control of change, in which case you're essentially in a closed interoperability environment).  Even well intentioned systems will sometimes accidentally ingest bogus data or make minor tweaks that suddenly cause data to no longer be fully conformant.  (Changes in the terminology space as codes get added/deprecated can also cause issues.)  So the presence of a profile declaration shouldn't usually be taken in substitution of checking that he rules are met.</p>

<p>The 'ideal' design objective with FHIR is for systems to emit a single resource instance that subsequently gets consumed by <em>all</em> recipients.  I.e. you don't emit different data for different consumers, you emit the same data for everyone (allowing for a security layer that strips elements/responses that the requester isn't allowed to see).  Demanding that instances declare desired profiles in order to interoperate imposes a tax on the sender because they have to modify their interface for each consumer who wants a distinct profile declaration (and each consumer will potentially want profile declarations specific to their needs).  Imposing such a tax isn't prohibited, but it should be carefully considered in terms of the total cost to the community.  Does the savings on the consumer in terms of increased efficiency of routing to appropriate validation outweigh the cost of modifying, testing and long-term maintenance of the profile declaration on the sending systems?  The calculation will vary depending on the number of receiving systems vs. sending systems as well as on the volume of candidate profiles the receiver might need to triage against.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The risk of mandating profile declaration (and particularly version-specific profile declaration) is that it acts as a barrier to interoperability.  "Nope, sorry, can't consume your data because you don't declare profile X, version Y.  Please go away and customize your application and then I'll consider consuming your data" (when the data itself already met all requirements for consumption).  "You must customize your application" inevitably translates into delay and significant dollars, even if the change is minor.  Sometimes it translates into failure of interoperability to occur at all - especially if the receiver doesn't have the leverage of regulation or large $$$ on their side.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this specific case, if you can't tell if an EOB is institutional or outpatient except by looking at the profile, then the specification is not FHIR conformant.  The institutional/outpatient determination <em>must</em> be exposed in some other way - in the worst case, as an extension.</p>

<p>One other consideration around profile declarations.  If the intention is to use the profiles for subsequent searching, then receiving apps can't ever rely exclusively on receiving profile declarations on inbound data - because at some point a new relevant profile will come along that will be relevant to historical data.  That means the system will have to have the ability to go through its data to determine profile applicability, independent of what was already previously declared (whether that's done pre-emptively or at time of query by profile may vary depending on system design and profile complexity.</p>

"I define what I want, you write code/tweak your interface engine to give it to me".  But in a RESTful space, it doesn't work so well.  In REST, you've got one interface and everyone comes along and grabs what they want from it.  While there is some degree of search-engine-optimization that goes on, by and large websites don't re-craft themselves when a new browser shows up.</p>

In general, a FHIR interface should work the same way independent of purpose.  If you want to move the patient room, you do a PUT to Encounter.  If you want to capture where the patient's valuables are, you do a PUT to Encounter.  If you want to discharge a patient, you do a PUT to Encounter.  There's no coded element that says "this is what I'm doing".

<p>In one of my guides, I originally had behaviour based on the profile that the Bundle conformed to.  I wasn't basing it on what the sender told me but rather which of the three Bundle profiles that it conformed to.  Eventually though, I realized that this wasn't a viable way of determining behaviour because I was artificially changing my profiles to ensure that there was a distinction between them.  We switched to an operation parameter and then, based on the parameter, we mandate that the receiver has sent us the appropriate profile.  That seems to me to be the proper way to do this.</p>

<p>Profiles don't tell you how to behave.  Profiles dictate what must be supported, nothing else.  So, for example, if you want to claim conformance to a profile that says "mustSupport display data element X", that doesn't mean that you only display the element if you receive that profile.  And most display behavior is driven by CapabilityStatement.  It is NON-CONFORMANT to drive behavior purely based on the declaration of a profile that can't also be inferred from data elements that are present in the instance.</p>

<p>Systems are required to check for modifier extensions in all instances.  It's one of the key things in the safety checklist.  (You should be looking for the presence of other modifier elements like Resource.implicitRules too.)  Failure to do that is unsafe.  Checking for a profile doesn't bypass the need to check for other things.  (And in most cases, you won't be able to count on the profiles you're interested in being declared for you in the first place.)</p>

<p>Behavior might be a wrong term here in what I'm trying to express. If the recieving end of a system is triggered by the data found in a resource, I agree that it is not the profiling that does the triggering, it is the fact that the specific piece of data exists. That specific piece of data may be present due to the fact that is has been specified as eg. mustSupport in the profile, and the recieving system could require data resources recieved must conform to a profile stating just that. In that sense it is an implicit behaviour due to profile conformance.</p>

<p>Data isn't present due to a profile.  Data is present because the system chooses to support it.  (It might choose to support it because it chooses to comply with one or more IGs, but that's a design-time expectation, not a run-time expectation.)  Profile declaration, at runtime, <em>do not</em> drive behavior.  If a system declares a profile or an IG in its CapabilityStatement, that identifies what it will 'support' <em>all the time</em>.  What it supports and what it does isn't going to change based on what profiles are or aren't declared in the instance.  </p>
<p>I.e. If you comply with US Core, CA Core and AU Core, then you would be expected to handle the mustSupports of all of those, regardless of which profile is declared on inbound - and would support them even if no profiles were declared on the inbound data.</p>

<p>The fact it's possible is good.  Well-designed profiles <em>should</em> allow multiple other profiles to be satisfied.  Constraining cardinality or slices in a way that prohibits sharing other information that might exist and be useful to some consumers is bad practice.</p>

<p>I tend to disagree. The fewer constraints and invariants you make, the less specific your system tends to be (or explode in complexity) and the harder it gets to build systems that can actually aid users  in using the systems as intended. This comes at the cost of interoperability - that is an obvious consequence.</p>

<p>The idea with FHIR is that systems expose the same set of data to everyone.  Consuming systems pay attention to the elements they care about and watch for unsupported modifier elements and ignore everything else.  We don't generally <em>want</em> interfaces that are carefully tuned to a single recipient.  We want general purpose interfaces that clients can grab what they need from - and if they need more over time and the interface supports it, they can just grab the additional information.</p>

<p>I don't just see FHIR as a glorified version of an OpenAPI. I see it  as great tool for expressing differences in a structured homogenized manner in a heterogeneous world. If I were to bring a system to the danish market supporting eg. the core danish IG, I would expect a lot of similarities when I would bring the same system to the norweigian market but I wouldn't expect it to work out of the box. I would still carefully have to inspect  eg. the norwegian core IG and cross check it on a semantic level (as well as legislation and so on), but at the very least I would have the differences expressed in the same syntactical language - and to some extend semantics as well.</p>

<p>I'm not saying it would work out of the box, but any extra elements you add when you adapt your element for the Norwegian market I'd expect show up to your Danish customers.  (And the Danish customers would consume/ignore as they wished.)  That doesn't mean you <em>have</em> to do things that way, but it's certainly cheaper/easier to maintain a single interface than it is to maintain distinct interfaces for each consuming system.  Consuming systems of FHIR interfaces should NOT presume that the sender will trim to only the data elements they care about or support.</p>

<p>So ... stating meta.profile shouldn't affect behaviour (except notifying anyone stating it and don't adhere to the stated profile - which is more of a debugging case) - whereas confromance to a profile <em>could</em> affect behaviour. This may also mean that stating meta.profile basically can only be used as an <em>untrusted</em>/untested hint. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> I believe your blog post now has written itself</p>

<p>The client claim may be just that (a claim, whether true or false) - IMHO a server should not reject a resource because a client-side claim Y is found to be false, but only if a server is (contractually) bound to only process resources that conform to profile X.

<p>An instance declaring a profile in <em>no way</em> mans that the receiver is obliged to support elements marked as MustSupport in the profile.  It doesn't even mean that the <em>sender</em> supports those elements.  MustSupport is really only meaningful in the context of an IG or other definitional specification.  You can use it to document specifications for what you want a system to do (IG, RFP) or even what you <em>can</em> do (published conformance statement for your system).  But in an instance, the only thing a profile says is "what constraints does this instance comply with".  It says nothing about the capabilities of the sender or the receiver.  You can certainly reject an instance that claims to comply to constraints it turns out not to (on the grounds that the instance is non-conformant), but there are no grounds for rejecting an instance because you don't support some of the profiles suggested by one or more of the profiles it declares (or because you don't recognize one or more of the profiles it declares at all).</p>
<p>It's probably worth submitting a change request to make clear that mustSupport is relevant for profiles declared on CapabilitySystem.resource.rest.profile and for profiles declared in IGs, but not for rest.supportedProfile and certainly not for meta.profile.</p>

<p>I was responding to this.  There is no reason for a server to reject a client based on their claim to conformance - except if the server validates the claim and determines it to be untrue.   There is no "interpretation" of a profile.  All meaning comes from the data sent, not any specified profiles.  Ignoring profiles is always safe and rejecting on the basis of declared profiles only really makes sense if :<br>
a) the system recognizes the declared profile<br>
b) the declared profile makes mandatory an element that the receiving system treats as prohibited<br>
Even then, the rejection should be on the basis of the inclusion of the prohibited element, not the declaration of the profile.  (And systems should be cautious about prohibiting (or setting upper-bound cardinality limits) on data - this should generally happen only when it's truly an error for the data to be present, not just when the system doesn't happen to support an element.)</p>

<p>Some of the sent data may well fall on the floor - and that's ok.  The receiver is obligated to check for mustSupport elements they don't recognize.  Other than that, they're free to ignore whatever they want - and senders can't presume a receiver will understand anything.  On a create/update, they can get a copy back of what was actually stored.  On a query response, it's really none of their business what the recipient pays any attention to.</p>

<p>I would still consider it a bit special/blunt for a sender just to hook up to a receiver and NOT consider what would be supported by the receiver and just assume that stuff would work out of the box without doing any inspection upfront in regards to the capabilites of the receiver. Some receivers might even manipulate what was received or even remove parts of the received in the content returned to the sender. While I can see that it would work in some scenarioes, I can also see that it wouln't work in others.</p>

<p>I think there might be slightly different meanings of <code>receiver</code> in this conversation. The server is not the same as the receiver. The server is the receiver on POST and PUT, but the client is the receiver on GET or search. In the latter case, Lloyd's point that <code>Senders are never required to inspect the capabilities of the receiver</code> makes perfect sense. Similarly, with POST and PUT, it is up to the client to determine if it cares about the success or failure of the request.</p>

<li>Many servers will have CapabilityStatements that don't declare rest.resource.profile at all - so inspection of what data elements they support won't be possible</li>
<li>When a server is responding to a query, there's no way for it to see what the client supports (clients don't expose a CapabilityStatement), so the only way to configure would be out-of-band.  Such configuration is very much expected to be the exception, not the norm.  What configuration <strong>is</strong> done will generally be focused on "what is the client <em>allowed</em> to access?", not "what does the client support?".  It's not the server's problem if the client doesn't support all of the data sent in a query response. </li>
<li>If a server is responding to a post, it'll either store the record or not, depending on whether it meets its business rule.  Very few clients will have the ability to configure what they send at runtime based on declared profiles.  The POST/PUT will either work or it won't and some of the data sent will quite possibly be ignored.  That's normal FHIR operation, not special in any way</li>
</ol>
<p>It's certainly possible to manipulate what's received on a per sender basis, but that's more the path of the old messaging paradigm where you had to play around with the data with an interface engine.  The intention with REST is you expose an interface and spit out what you've got and the receiver can take it or leave it.  Any manipulation is focused on access permissions, not profiles.</p>

<p>W.r.t. the run-time use of profiles:<br>
A client is allowed to query for “give me all FHIR Observations that correspond to a particular FHIR profile”, right, and the FHIR Server responding with a result-set of Resources that all (are made by the Server to) conform to said FHIR profile (regardless of how these were uploaded to the FHIR Server)?</p>
<p>GET /fhir/4.0/Observation/?_profile="canonical|version" </p>

<p>I client can ask - there's no guarantee a server will support that though.
