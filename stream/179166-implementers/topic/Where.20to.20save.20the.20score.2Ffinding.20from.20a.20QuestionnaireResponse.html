<p>Where are people storing the scoring for a questionnaire? For example, with a PHQ-9 depression screening questionnaire, each answer is tied to a point value. The points are added up for a total score, providing a way to screen for low/medium/high risk for depression.</p>
<p>Similarly, for autism screenings, those can also be tied to a score.</p>
<p>Where are people storing the score and the risk/finding? Are you somehow including it as another item in the QuestionnaireResponse? <br>
Or are you creating an observation that ties back to the QuestionnaireResponse ID?</p>

<p>The convention is that these are stored as additional question items - though they might be marked as 'readOnly', or with SDC extensions as completely hidden.  The resulting answer might then be extracted as an Observation value as well.  (As an aside, there's a whole <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179255" href="/#narrow/stream/179255-questionnaire">#questionnaire</a>  stream for questionnaire-related questions.)</p>
