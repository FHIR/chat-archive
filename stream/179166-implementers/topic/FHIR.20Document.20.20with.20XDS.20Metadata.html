<p>This is my first post in the community, hello to everybody from Austria.</p>
<p>Our company is developing medical archiving solutions, and we have recently started to integrate FHIR capabilities. We would like to archive FHIR documents, which have been mostly converted from other sources by our own tools (e.g. from HL7 ORU). So documents according to the FHIR document paradigm seem a reasonable choice (i.e. "Bundle" with "Composition" + other ressources like DiagnosticReport). </p>
<p>Now, we would like to add some Metadata coming from the XDS domain (XDS DocumentEntry) to the FHIR documents. The "DocumentReference" has the appropriate metadata (i.e. DocumentReference.context). But it seems not like a good idea to mix the two concepts "Composition" and "DocumentReference".</p>
<p>What would be a good way of having both FHIR documents according to the document paradigm AND integrating the DocumentReference.context? </p>
<p>Any help most appreciated!</p>

<p>@Thomas Pellizzari  it is a good idea. The two concept "Composition" and "DocumentReference" can be used together.  And your Document Reference resource can reference the Composition.</p>

<p>DocumentReference is the proper metadata to point at any kind of document. It works just as well for FHIR Documents as it does for CDA documents or even proprietary documents like WORD.

<p>IHE is even looking to it as a general metadata registry for patients that are not patient centric, like stylesheets.  This is unlike XDS, but is differentiated by the fact that there is NOT a Patient indicated... This is a new work item about to be sent out for Public Comment.</p>

<p>From the original question, I'm not sure that FHIR Documents are actually needed, or if they are a by-product of the architecture investigated so far.<br>
If <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193118">@Thomas Pellizzari</span> is really trying to store XDS documents and metadata in FHIR, or provide a FHIR interface to XDS, or store ORU reports (of some sort) with XDS metadata, then I would suggest skipping FHIR Compositions totally. Instead look at the IHE MHD profile which standardizeds a FHIR interface for XDS, including mapping XDS metadata to FHIR DocumentReference elements.</p>

<p>Thank you everybody for your feedback, that helps a lot.</p>
<p>Just for clarification, we are trying to achieve several goals:</p>
<p>1) "Upgrade" ORU reports to  a more interchangeable format, with proper code systems etc. Or in other words, we would like to <br>
 prefer FHIR over HL7 CDA whenever possible (sometimes  it is not, of course).</p>
<p>2) Provide access  to  documents via MHD (which  has a well-defined mapping to  DocumentReference)</p>
<p>3) Find a meaningful  structure for long-term archiving of these data. As some may know, we  in the german speaking countries have an<br>
     obsession  with long-term archiving.</p>
