<p>Im new to fhir framework and it seems so overwhelming for me to understand the whole process in fhir. I have been a developer for almost 10 years and were able to develop a web application from scratch but health care industry is new to me specially this fhir specification. Based on my understanding, fhir is just a tool to follow the standards in EHR (I had read this one - <a href="https://www.health-samurai.io/articles/the-fhir-guide-for-ctos-and-technical-leaders" target="_blank" title="https://www.health-samurai.io/articles/the-fhir-guide-for-ctos-and-technical-leaders">https://www.health-samurai.io/articles/the-fhir-guide-for-ctos-and-technical-leaders</a>).  My new project is to develop a system that supports fhir. I've been careful for the steps to do hence I wanted to somehow understand the bigger picture first on how this fhir works or if im going to implement it, at least its following the industry standard. </p>
<p>My first question is what is the database design if you're going to implement CMS web application and you add the fhir database to it. Am I need to create a users table or fhir already have this table?</p>
<p>Also,  I really wanted to see what fhir database looks like or an ERD of it, so that I can somehow understand the tables. I hoping for your inputs. Thank you!!!</p>

<p>FHIR's focus is exchanging health data, rather than storing it. A good place to start is <a href="http://build.fhir.org/index.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/index.html">http://build.fhir.org/index.html</a> . It links to developer and architect introductions.</p>

<p>you can persist data as resources if you want. But you don't have to. See discussion at <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/storage.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/storage.html">hl7.org/fhir/storage.html</a> and <a href="http://www.healthintersections.com.au/?p=2776" target="_blank" title="http://www.healthintersections.com.au/?p=2776">http://www.healthintersections.com.au/?p=2776</a></p>
