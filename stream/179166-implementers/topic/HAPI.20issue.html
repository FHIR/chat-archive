<p>I am currently new on HAPI FHIR. I am trying to import a package that contains all the resources, e.t.c through the command : fhir install de.gecco 1.0.3 .  I have installed a hapi fhir serve local through the github docker image through docker run -p 8080:8080 hapiproject/hapi:latest. How is it possible to install for testing the above mention fhir package ? I would really appreciate any help. I am fighting for days and I can make it work. Thank you in advance</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="413932">@Nek L</span> When you post, be sure to change the topic to something specific to your question.  (I've moved this so it's no longer under the Immunication vaccineCode thread<br>
This sounds like something you might get more support for by asking on the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179167" href="/#narrow/stream/179167-hapi">#hapi</a> stream.  You'll need to describe what sort of problems you're running into for people to be able to help you though.</p>
