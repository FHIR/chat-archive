<p>Is there way we can have coverage (insurance) information in patient resource.</p>
<p>I have the use case where i will get the input to create member which will have insurance details along with demographic details and and system expect insurance details along with demographic details.</p>

<p>Extensions would work if all you need is the basics ( plan, member, insurance co) Otherwise Bundle Coverage with Patient.</p>

<p>If you have enough information to populate a Coverage resource, you should use the resource - that's the way you get interoperability.  It will be reasonably common that data that's submitted will end up populating multiple resources.</p>

<p>It would be best to keep coverage information independent from Patient resource.  For separation of design. Also from a Privacy and Security perspective.</p>
