<p>I'm doing some code generation using the hl7.fhir.rx.core packages and there are some resources in there that I think are examples based on their id and names (like example-composition). I'd like to have a reliable way to exclude them, but there doesn't seem to be anything in the .index.json file (other than their name) to indicate they are examples.  I'm also not clear on why they are even in that package and not just in the hl7.fhir.rx.examples package.  Is it safe to just exclude them based on their 'id' starting with 'example'?</p>

<p>there's no safe way which is why I didn't exclude them from core. Because although they are labelled as examples they get used some places</p>

<p>you could have a higher risk tolerance on this than me, and delete them if they have 'example' as an id, or in their name.</p>
