<p>Forge 16.1 for STU3 is now available for download from <a href="https://simplifier.net/forge" target="_blank" title="https://simplifier.net/forge">https://simplifier.net/forge</a>.</p>
<p>This new version represents a minor update. It contains fixes for a couple of issues that were reported by the community since the initial STU3 release for the HL7 WGM in Madrid. Please note that not all known issues have been fixed yet, as we did not want to delay publication of the update any longer. We'll try to address the remaining known issues in a future release.</p>
<p>Mr. Forge is now taking two weeks vacation and will be back online in July. If you find any new issues, please report them at <a href="mailto:forge@furore.com" title="mailto:forge@furore.com">forge@furore.com</a>.</p>
<p>Happy profiling!</p>
<p>Michel Rutten</p>
