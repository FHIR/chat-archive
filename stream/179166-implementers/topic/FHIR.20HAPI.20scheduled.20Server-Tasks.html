<p>Testing FHIR HAPI i was wondering if there is any kind of built in mechanism to register and perform scheduled Server-Tasks. Let's say i wanted to delete certain resources, as soon as they reach their expiration date which is defined by a custom extension.</p>
<p>I found <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Server.20side.20triggers" title="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Server.20side.20triggers">this discussion</a> which seems to indicate that the EventDefinition resource is capable of holding TriggerDefinitions and even JavaScript code expressions.<br>
I am not sure if the execution of a TriggerDefinition is built into HAPI, or if it is up to the implementers to write custom code. <br>
Usually i am able to find examples on the baseR4 test server, but unfortunately there are no EventDefinitions.</p>
