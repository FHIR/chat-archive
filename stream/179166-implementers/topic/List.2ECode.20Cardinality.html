<p>I noticed that List.Code was defined as 0..1 and was wondering about a case where it might be preferable to supply multiple codes.  This could be used either in a situation where multiple values would help specify the lists's purpose, or, as is described in the Scope and Usage for List, in a situation where the list contains multiple types of resources.  Or in those situations would it be more appropriate to just have a single value that is specific enough to describe the details of the list's purpose?</p>

<p>The intention is that the code is specific enough to describe the lists purpose.</p>
