<p>Suppose I have a business mobile phone number for someone: how would ContactPoint support that? I've found some reference to this discussion in <a href="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=12684" target="_blank" title="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=12684">GF#12684</a> but that tracker item requested sms as system and so the discussion on business mobile was not quite pursued.</p>
<p>The logical model tells me I need to be able to distinguish business/private mobile numbers. Do I need to extend ContactPoint for a second .use code?</p>

<p>How would you use a 'business mobile' in a distinct manner from any other business number?  The purpose of 'use' is to help you decide which number to call.  The business number is the number you'd expect to reach someone during business hours.  The mobile is the one you'd expect to be able to reach at any time.</p>
