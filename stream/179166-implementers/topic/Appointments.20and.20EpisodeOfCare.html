<p>Hi. Working with various PAS systems I'm used to the idea that an appointment is typically linked to an episode of care. But looking into the FHIR resources I can't find any obvious way to model that. I do understand that FHIR resources can be arbitrarily bundled together, but the link between an appointment and an episode of care is something I would expect to be formally modelled by some kind of attribute/reference on the appointment. </p>
<p>So... is there something I've missed? Or is my understanding simplistic and there's other resources that should be involved in capturing the relationship between an Appointment and an EpisodeOfCare? Thanks!</p>

<p>There is a standard extension that can be used for that, I'll have to go looking for it though.</p>
