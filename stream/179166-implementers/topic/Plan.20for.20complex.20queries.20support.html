<p>I wonder what the plan of FHIR for complex queries is.</p>
<p>Currently we have:</p>
<p>1) standard queries as per <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html</a> but as it does not support OR, (), sub-queries etc, it can work for very simple resource retrievals only<br>
2) _filter as per <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search_filter.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search_filter.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search_filter.html</a> which seems promising however it is not completely documented,  HAPI doesn't support it and the maturity is still N/A.<br>
3) fluentPath <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2016May/fluentpath.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/2016May/fluentpath.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/2016May/fluentpath.html</a> which aligns with HL7 CQL.<br>
4) Advanced search as per 2.1.1.7 in <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html</a>.  This is actual a custom interface and needs client and server setup the parameters so cannot be used as a P&amp;P standard. for that reason I can't call it  a standard.</p>
<p>Which one is going to be the FHIR complex query protocol of choice?</p>
<p>PS&gt; (example for complex queries: Show me all patients having Dr A as care provider, having at least 2 diagnosis coded as X and born between D1 and D2)</p>

<p>Thanks. That's interesting however my example is just one example. There are many complex queries and I wonder which approach is going to be the strategic protocol development choice.</p>

<p>(1) - see 2<br>
(2) - please explain how _filter is not completely documented. Maturity is FMM 1. I should document that. As far as support in servers other than mine, I cannot say <br>
(3) I am sure that fluent path will not be part of the standard search interface. But you can define parameters that are defined by fluent path expressions - that's how my server works now</p>

<p>(4) advanved search is your extensibility point </p>

<p>we do not think that we have solved query requirements yet. It was on the slate for STU 3, but it has missed the boat now. </p>

<p>My concern is that to the extent the formal specification adds complexity, it decreases interoperability in inverse proportion. </p>

<p>Peter, yes, I also expect the number of servers implementing this kind of search will be low, so in practice you couldn't count on it when writing a client...</p>

<p>Agreed, there are so many use cases for complex query, and various ways of meeting that. The CQL specification in particular focuses on enabling complex queries to be expressed in a way that supports translation to simpler queries through a data access layer, such as FHIR, or a B-Tree style index API.</p>

<p>Hi Bryn, never looked at it that way... so you made that work? Translate CQL into separate FHIR REST calls?</p>

<p>Yes, that's what we got working at the connect-a-thon Saturday. Going to host a HAPI server that has it plugged in for more testing, but it's basically functional.</p>
