<p>I'm looking for clarification on the comment on event-location extension as to how this does or does not relate to Provenance.  Without the comment the definition is clear, but the comment obscures the meaning and boundary with Provenance.</p>

<p>I also have a question: When we want to document, for a pregnancy, where the delivery took place, and where this was reported (Suppose baby was born at home, and this was declared in a hospital). If we add an extension event-location o Observation, that would refer to <br>
a) the location of the delivery<br>
b) the location where the report was made</p>

<p>It would indicate where the event occurred.</p>

<p>so we need another extension to indicate where this was reported, right?</p>

<p>Possibly 2 extensions - where did you send the records and where are the records held now</p>

<p>I don't mean to store where the records are held... I just want to cover "this person was borm at their mother's home; this information was reported at the hospital X"</p>
