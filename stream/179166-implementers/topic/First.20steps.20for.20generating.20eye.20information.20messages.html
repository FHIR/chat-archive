<p>Hi all,<br>
I'm new in FHIR. I' m working for a company that produces HW and SW for refractive  eye  surgery . <br>
Which are the first steps you can reccomend to me to generate FHIR messages from actual set of information ?</p>
<p>P.S. At the moment all devices communicate with a Website that will generate FHIR messages.<br>
Thank you</p>

<p>Welcome :)  First, it probably makes sense to investigate more about who you'd be sending the FHIR content to - and what their expectations are.  A lot of FHIR systems use REST rather than messaging to share data.  You'll also want to see which resources they support.  My guess is you'll primarily be sharing Observation instances, but Procedure, Encounter, ServiceRequest, Practitioner, Patient, MedicationAdministration and maybe a few others are possibilities.  Take a look at the resource definitions and examples and think about how your data might be best exposed using them.  If you have questions, this is a good place to ask them.</p>
