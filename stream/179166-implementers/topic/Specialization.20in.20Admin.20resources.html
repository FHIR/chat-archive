<p>My question: do you think that it would be useful for us to introduce at least an abstract ancestor for Patient/RelatedPerson/Practitioner? Vote with <span aria-label="thumbs up" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="thumbs up">:thumbs_up:</span>  or <span aria-label="thumbs down" class="emoji emoji-1f44e" role="img" title="thumbs down">:thumbs_down:</span> </p>
<p>Note: I have not investigated yet whether this is actually possible - though I expect it is - nor do I know how far we can go given various operational constraints. Nor do I know how far I think we should go</p>

<p>no, because the pattern semantics are looser that direct inheritance - the rules are much harder for the second. I am generating patterns into HAPI, but it's a more flexible pattern</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191447">@Mark Kramer</span> has demonstrated the powerful benefits of introducing additional (abstract) base classes. As a software developer, common bases classes and interfaces usually make my life easier. So in general, I'd certainly like to investigate this approach.</p>

<p>I like the idea from an architectural purity standpoint provided that it will be mostly just used as part of building the specification and largely hidden from regular implementers. One of the problems we had with V3 adoption is that some implementers who lacked a theoretical CS background simply didn't understand how RIM inheritance worked. So as long as we still end up with a single Patient resource page containing all of the elements and don't have to look up some common elements on a separate page for the superclass, then I think this would be a positive change.</p>

<p>it goes a bit further than a fancy wrapper interface. it does specifically propose that you would have inheritance - maybe an abstract ancestor called 'Actor' and then you would do Reference(Actor) instead of Reference(Patient | RelatedPerson | Practitioner) - this is much more than just decorating with an interface</p>

<p>Thought exercise:  if we go down the rabbit hole of making abstract ancestor classes available as interoperable resources, where does that end?  I'm imagining chatter between multiple systems using all of the abstract classes presented by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191447">@Mark Kramer</span>, and am reminded of these AI systems that are inventing their own languages that needed to be shut down.  </p>
<p>So I sort of agree with Eric Haas, that we need to keep the human readability element in place for the time being.  There will be someday in the future when these abstract classes are all made available, but the tooling isn't entirely in place for what we currently have.  Save the abstract ancestor classes for HL7 2030.</p>

<p>The RIM never allowed pointing to individuals independent of their role - you were always pointing to an AssignedEntity (Practitioner), RelatedEntity (RelatedPerson) or Patient.  The difference with the RIM is that you <em>always</em> had to point to a different class to convey information such as gender, birthDate, etc. - and all such demographics was available for everyone.  With FHIR we said "very few implementers actually store data that way - there are usually separate tables for practitioners, patients and relatives and each has distinct columns for gender, birthDate, etc.  Furthermore, the set of demographic information commonly tracked for Patients, Practitioners and RelatedPersons is generally quite distinct - and we don't want to munge the 80% for all three use-cases together.</p>

<p>As opposed to other application layer design patterns.  Inheritance somewhat presumes an object-oriented paradigm; but that's not necessarily always a safe assumption.  Node/Javascript developers might just as likely use decorators, chained methods, monads, or other functional programming patterns.  Object interfaces (denoted by IObject and similar notation in .NET) are a borrowed language feature from functional languages like lisp and scheme, and map nicely to FHIR extensions and the type of interface pattern that Michel and Lloyd have mentioned.  It's a sort of happy compromise between object and functional paradigms.</p>

<p>&lt;academic&gt; inheritance is about definitional things, so you define something in terms of another thing and it acquires the things (behaviour, structural features) of its parent. Subtyping is about whether a thing is substitutable for another thing for a given purpose. In a lot of implementations (most), inheritance will give you subtyping, but its not the only way you can get subtyping, and there are features (type parameters being a prominent one) that can mean that inheritance does not imply subtyping&lt;/academic&gt;. I'm writing this reluctantly, though. I don't think it really changes anything</p>

<p>Going out on a limb here, because I'm not 100% sure what Lloyd had in mind regarding interfaces, but it might roughly be described as an 'extensions everything' approach.  So instead of creating an <code>Individual</code> resourceType as an abstract ancestor, it would be more like creating an <code>individual</code> extension which Patient, RelatedPerson, Practitioners and others use to get to their current schema definitions (presumably including the <code>patient</code> and/or <code>subject</code> field). But I'm being handwavy and non-formal in my use of the term extension here.</p>

<p>I'm not against inheritance.  I'm concerned about the behavior I think it'll drive.  As an example, take maritalStatus.  We've identified it as a core element for Patient, but not for Practitioner or RelatedPerson.  If we create a hierarchy, where will it live in the hierarchy?  Most modeling-oriented people will push to it to be moved to the common abstract on the grounds that it logically exists for all three and it's probably tracked by at least a tiny percentage of systems for Practitioner and perhaps RelatedPerson too.   Arguing to keep it where it is will be much harder.  And if we do move it up, then the 80% notion becomes messier for those implementing the specializations.  With patterns and interfaces, on the other hand, it's easy enough to expose the core element from Patient and extension elements from the other two as elements (if desired) and it doesn't change resource design.  It also allows for name variance where that makes things easier for the single-resource implementers while still allowing consistent names for those systems that want to manipulate resources generically.</p>

<p>I go back to my question about the Workflow pattern -- not in the sense of using that as some object hierarchy, but that any resource that implements one of it's (sort of) abstract interfaces should at least use the names defined by the pattern.   So, o-o aside, it seems like there should be some consistent naming conventions, maybe defined by patterns like Workflow, so that users know what to expect when they 'pick up' any FHIR resource, that there will be consistency in naming similar conceptual things (property names).   It seems as a 'outsider to the committee discussions' that names are chosen that do not necessarily align with that of the Workflow pattern, maybe for good reason in the committee, but from an 'outsider/user' of the pattern these varied names might cause more confusion than help.   (This brings up this related question, what is this discussion trying to accomplish -- an oo paradigm for FHIR resources or a consistency in naming or something else?)</p>

<p>Thanks for taking this on. Those changes would be tremendously beneficial to the long term health of FHIR. Provided that the specification is still easy for new implementers to understand so that someone who just wants to hack together a simple JSON string for a Patient can find everything they need on the Patient page without having to hunt through a bunch of pattern pages. In other words the additional complexity introduced by using patterns (interfaces) in that way should be  hidden as much as possible in the build process and lower layers of the specification.</p>

<p>Has anyone thought of an aliasing mechanism?   The notion is that the pattern (e.g. Workflow) defines the SHALL properties but a committee can define an alias (prop name) that meets their domain's unique naming convention?

<p>I recognize that building an interface is going to be challenging - but I think the 'challenging' bit is where there isn't a 1..1 correspondence of elements, difference in types, variations in value sets, etc.  I would think that if the sole difference was name, that should be pretty easy to manage.</p>
<p>What we've said is that if a domain has a common term that is widely recognized in that implementation community and the 'standard pattern' term is not widely recognized or is likely to be confusing/misleading in that community, the resource would use the name that was common in the domain.  Forcing the 'standard pattern' name would "make things harder" by increasing the learning curve for implementers who only care about that one domain and would also create confusion and all of the costs that come with misunderstanding/interpreting the specification.</p>

<p>This to me is the biggest problem with the current "patterns".  I remember when FHIR first came out that committees were told that we could use names for data elements that matched what implementers within that community called things.  Thus, instead of occurrencePeriod on the Medication Dispense resource, we have "whenPrepared" and "whenHandedOver" which finally addressed a longstanding puzzle for implementers in the dispensing space about what "effectiveTime.low and .high" actually meant.  If you wanted blind consistency, you're effectively telling the pharmacy-space implementers "forget what you call things, we have to use these generic names to meet some data modeler's requirement/bugaboo of consistency.</p>
<p>I agree with consistency if there is no reason to be different - name vs deviceName, supportingInformation vs supportingInfo, etc.  but if a committee has a reason for being different, and the bar should be very low for this difference, then they should feel empowered to call things the way their community calls them.</p>
<p>Thus the pattern should be a mappable construct where I show how my resource maps to the pattern and not a blind inheritance or consistency requirement.</p>

<p>in terms of progress, I gained some peace with how we are looking at another pattern - Product. <br>
We let the resources (medication, device, nutrition, biologicallyderivedproduct) follow their path and get the people to join discussions  and eventually this means that resources can align. I think it wastes a lot of effort but at least does not impose any foreign language in the committees and it allows consensus, whenever it comes.</p>

<p>I like the idea of patterns driven by real use cases, and some common discussions to force people to look at that pattern. Committees should be able to deviate by default, but there should be a check to see when deviation is no longer worth it.</p>

<p>I think what makes sense is the evaluation of value.  If we're going to mandate a name change (or any other kind of change), we need to weigh the cost to the single-domain communities and implementers vs. the benefit of whomever the pattern is for.  That said, I really don't understand why names are such a big issue.  Structural and design issues create much more grief.</p>

<p>How many use cases do we have where we'd actually apply this inheritance/hierarchy/interface pattern?  Is it only for Actors?  Would we actually want to apply this to Events as Eric Hass mentioned?  If it is only Actors, is it worth the effort to build a formal solution for this rather than a KISS solution of just having WGs manually keep things in sync?  Most of the actors are owned by PA so it isn't even that much cross-WG coordination.</p>

<p>Implementer impacts:<br>
- instead of Reference(Patient|...) the specification would say "Reference(Actor)"<br>
- we would ship StructureDefinitions for the patterns<br>
- implementers generating source can generate the source for the patterns however they want (I'll do it automatically in HAPI)<br>
- in HAPI, you'll be able to take a target of a reference and do factory.asActor(resource) and get an IActor facade to it if you want<br>
- in non-typed languages, you can just treat them as if they are equivalent anyway, but this servers as helpful documentation</p>

<p>My use case isn’t about the admin resources, but I do believe that the ability to specify Reference(Pattern) is a good thing to add to the methodology.  I have seen a few resources where they are currently enumerating the choice of resources and I think that this will become onerous to add new choices in the future.  I also think that it puts the requirement to know on the owner of the resource with the choice rather than the resources that may decide they want to be part of that choice.<br>
My example is ChargeItemDefinition which currently lists three resources as the item being the choice of the charge definition.  There are plenty of other resources that might make sense there but that requires those resource owners to make a request to PA to update ChangeItemDefinition.  If, instead, ChargeItemDefinition just said instance: Reference(ChargeableItem), then I could introduce a new resource and declare it to match the pattern and it would automatically be allowed in a ChargeItemDefinition.</p>

<p>So now for each reference we know which resources can be referenced - that makes validation trivial - in the future we'll have to navigate through a hierarchy to do that? How is that better?</p>

<p>I would totally agree to this.  Although I truly believe that this new capability will help the better specification of our resources, it does force all of us to verify that resources are referencing the proper patterns appropriately.  This might end up be slightly harder than seeing a specific choice of resources.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do we now get a limited set of references we can use. </li>
<li>I don’t think having to remember what in the actor list or the event list is a step into the light.  </li>
<li>How does this set of options carry over into an implementation where I support only two of the  three things. </li>
<li>what is the cost of this change when applied.</li>
</ul>

<li>if you want</li>
<li>well, it allows you to delegate the choice, where that's appropriate - that saves you time, if you want to be saved time</li>
<li>you can constrain it in an implementation</li>
<li>I won't be charging you any $$ for this</li>

<p>Resource referencing contains entropic information about how each resource differs, and is part of what makes each resource unique.  We’ve been using a lossy/handwavy schema definitions in our client under the idea of “be explicit when sending data, and be permissive when accepting it”.  So, we’ve effectively made all the resources references consistent at a lowest-common denominator.  And we lose a lot of functionality by doing so.  Those differing sets were hard-won through years of meetings and review.  Shouldn’t toss out the baby with the bath water.</p>
