<p>I have a use case where some ServiceRequest need to be authorized by more than one party.  What would be the correct way to do that? I looked at Consent but that feels wrong because the focus there is healthcare consumer. Would Contract be an option or something else?</p>

<p>ServiceRequest.author would be the individual who takes primary responsibility for initiating the ServiceRequest.  However, anyone else involved in the review/sign-off can be captured using Provenance.</p>

<p>I did not consider Provenance but that makes sense indeed tx!</p>
