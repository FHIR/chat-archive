<p>I'm trying to find a way to represent a tumor. It is not just an ID, but a persistent entity, tracked over time, with gross and microscopic properties (size, borders, etc.).  What FHIR resource should I use?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> That might be the closest thing, but I'm a bit uncomfortable with the idea that a tumor is a body site. My naive interpretation of body site is a place in the body, like "left elbow". A tumor is more than a place. </p>

<p>I'm currently in the same situation as Mark, regarding the representation of a tumor with all it's details. We also had a few words about that during yesterday's lunch meeting of the oncology group.<br>
A tumor would consist of the diagnostic information at least, typically including ICD-10 of the main tumor, ICD-O morphology and location, metastatis, UICC/AJCC/TNM and a bunch of other classifications and pathology information.<br>
Usually, in a specialized oncology documentation system, all these are bundled along with other information like tumor board decisions, therapies, follow ups, recurrence diagnosis and therapy and so on.</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether a special resource is needed here or if a Composition can/should be profiled to fulfill the requirements to put everything belonging to a certain tumor disease into one "bag".<br>
One might then describe the main tumor diagnosis as a Condition, eventually using Condition.category to be distinctive against other Conditions that may be part of the tumor disease.</p>

<p>The other way around, the tumor Condition would indeed, like Grahame says, need a reference to something like "Disease", possibly using Condition.context.<br>
Condition.context would need the cardinality increased to 0..*, since a condition might be part of an Encounter and of a Disease.</p>

<p>When using Composition, that would have to be updated over time (years), while a distinct "Disease" resource might be more stable in terms of the data contained. But a "Disease" would needed to be referenced from virtually any other resource. So this would need enabling references everywhere (maybe the expanded Linkage resource, or a new Relationship (or similar name?) resource, that was discussed in PC yesterday</p>

<p>That's true. Still, there's much inthe description of Composition that would also fit for a Disease. Especially, for a long term disease it also applies that you have multiple stable documents generated from it over time, like tumor board protocols or several types of letters.<br>
So at least there will be many similarities</p>

<p>One of the major use-cases for BodySite was the notion of turmor.  Another was patches of skin used in decision support.  Lesions or moles is another.  If it's something easy like "left elbow", there's no need for a resource instance to track that or group observations associated with it.  BodySite is what allows you to capture measurements of a particular tumor over time, identify procedures that targeted a specific tumor, etc.</p>

<p>We have been representing the cancer diagnosis as a condition, with things like the TNM score, etc. associated to the condition as Observations related to the condition through the extension event.reasonReference.<br>
However I understand the distinction of trying to represent the tumor proper as a seperate entity with bodySite. It may be splitting hairs but as far as I understand it there are some observations about the tumor itself (size, necrosis, receptor status, etc.) while others (metastases, TNM, etc.) are in my opinion associated with the condition/diagnosis, but may have been derived from observations of the tumor mass</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> A body site is certainly a relevant part of a tumor's description, but that describes only half of what ICD-O expresses. So this is rather a part of a bigger tumor entity than the head of a collection of the details I mentioned above</p>

<p>Apart from that, there are tumors that have more than one location (e.g. with metastasis. bilateral tumors).<br>
Basically, tumors are certain types of cells. And secondly, they manifestate at some location(s) of the body</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> Let's get back to the issue.  The use case I'm supporting involves measuring response to treatment, using a criteria called RECIST (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors). RECIST follows individual tumors (up to 2 per organ, up to 5 total). Measurements are taken to reveal how these tumors change over time. <em>Observations must be linked to specific tumors</em>. Another challenge is that tumors can  split, two tumors can merge, and a tumor can spread to new parts of the body.  If we can support the unique identification of tumors, so observations of size, receptor status, and other properties can be tracked over a period of months and years, then I'm good.  </p>

<p>Well, Procedures can't be done on Conditions, but they can be done on a BodySite.  As well, in general, a patient with multiple lesions or tumors that are all tied to the same underlying type of cancer would typically be captured as one Condition, but multiple body sites (tumors/lesions) would be tracked for repeated observations, procedures and possibly substance administrations.  BodySite is intended to represent any identifiable part of the body that can be the focus of a procedure, observation, drug administration, etc.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191447">@Mark Kramer</span>  as far as I can understand your use case however,  it would make sense to tie these Observation to a single bodySite resource. However, as I was alluding to before, not all Observations can be tied to an individual tumor but may refer to the cancer diagnosis as a whole. I think distinctions may need to be made for Observations that are lesion (individual tumor) specific vs those referring to the diagnosis as a whole. Thoughts?</p>

<p>So the issue we have been having trouble with is that Observations allow for a reference to the subject (Patient) but don't allow for a reference to the target object of the observation. (This lesion has a diameter of 3 cm).. If Observation.bodySite were a reference to a BodySite, then you could allow for  observations to pertain to a particular lesion within the same contextual disorder. As in, patient has breast neoplasm, two lesions, each lesion having distinct histology or genomic profiles. Though this doesn't quite cover metastatic disease, which we have also been capturing as a second Condition with a code denoting that that the lesion is secondary, however without a reference to the primary yet. </p>

<p>So, we have arrived at solution, but a rather inelegant one, in my opinion: (1) Use BodySite to uniquely represent a tumor entity located at a body site, and use the body-site-instance extension to link observations to that BodySite. </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191436">@Stefan Lang</span> The issue we thought about with that is will this Disease be represented as a novel Condition resource on recurrence? I know when I would look at medical histories, I wouldn't see multiple instances of breast cancer but just a single one. I'm not sure how FHIR would expect a single disorder's historical occurrences to be represented.</p>

<p>SNOMED's BodyStructure is quite broad though (anything from a rash to a knee to a tumor). If we pursued this, we might just have BodyStructure and use it for both cases (so a "Tumor" BodyStructure might be <code>locatedWithin</code> (or something) a "left knee" BodyStructure).</p>

<p>I think that tumours and the newly renamed BodyStructure resource are rather like an un-excised specimen.</p>
<p>The proposed designs treat each tumour as a distinct location of a condition: body-site (location) is enhanced to become body structure.<br>
Another approach would be to consider a tumour as an object (like a specimen) which has a location and is part of a condition.<br>

<p>Mark nothing lame about how body site is currently defined and used.  Most of time the body site is part of a pre coordinated observation code and otherwise a .bodysite code works just fine.  Accessing the bodysite resource via an extension is there for a use case like this and its the first time use case based trackers have come up for it - not counting the many attempts to get rid of the resource all together.</p>

<p>I had to transmit lung tumors in a project last year from a viewer to a reporting system, using FHIR. Since this was previous to this thread, I opted to use Observation as my base-Resource. I represented the properties of the tumor in components (diameters, shape, etc.) and added an extension for the long-term tracking identifier. My main challenge were not my doubts about whether I was using the proper Resource type, but the many missing codes in SNOMED, LOINC, RadLex, etc. to express the many properties of the tumor in a non-proprietary manner.<br>
I am looking forward to the outcome of this thread and might reshape my output based on it. But I think for true interoperability between systems which handle tumor data, one would have to request a plethora of codes from LOINC, etc.</p>

<p>That's a good reason to be cautious of it.  But the meaning doesn't really match either.  Focal subject lets you communicate the heart rate of a fetus or the blood type of a donor and have that Observation on the patient's record.  In both cases, the observations aren't "about" the patient - they're about someone/something else.  But a tumor type measurement or dimension measurement are still properly "about" the patient, so that's not a modifier - and thus helps indicate that the extension isn't the correct thing to use.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192169">@Tilo Christ</span>  Hi Tilo. There is a lot of working going on at the moment, mainly driven by an NLM grant to the University of Nebraska Medical Center to create terms to map to the CAP protocols. There is standardisation work going on internationally (ICCR) which involves many colleges of pathology and UNMC. For the cutting edge, I direct you to the SNOMED CT international confluence pages: <a href="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/iPaLM/Cancer+Synoptic+Subgroup" target="_blank" title="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/iPaLM/Cancer+Synoptic+Subgroup">https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/iPaLM/Cancer+Synoptic+Subgroup</a> . You will need to create an account there if you don't already have one. Essentially the team at UNMC are encoding the CAP cancer worksheets (synoptic reports) with fully modeled SNOMED CT concepts and then submitting them to both SNOMED international and LOINC. So the codes will be LOINC and there will be Observable expressions in a reference set map which will be published jointly by SNOMED International and Regenstreif.</p>

<p>Let me try to sum up my point of view:  (1) We need to rename and broaden the definition of BodySite to BodyStructure.  (2) In Observation, add Observation.BodyStructure  (Reference(BodyStructure). I personally don't think Observation.BodyStructure should be an extension.  If we keep Observation.BodySite (CodeableConcept) then we need an invariant that says you can't use both BodySite and BodyStructure. (3) We  do not need to change the Observation's focal subject - I agree with Lloyd, the subject is the patient, not the tumor.</p>

<p>I agree completely with Mark's (1) and (3).<br>
Regarding (2): there will be a lot of other resources that need to point to BodyStructure, e.g. when describing surgery or medication and I doubt these will be in the 80% scope, so an extension may be fine.<br>
Also, as a second thought on the proposed invariant, how would one describe that an observation is about a brain metastasis that's part of a breast cancer? So better leave that open and, if needed, constrain it within a profile.</p>

<p>Joke for HL7 v3 old timers: ask Barry Smith - this is very reminiscent of the kind of issue he always raised when pointing out supposed semantic flaws in the RIM. Does the 'observation' (of the tumor)  exist, or does the Tumor exist (because I observe it)? No wonder this thread (again) attracts a lot of posts..<br>
There is no perfect answer, HL7 modeling tradition has it that a Timor doesn't exist as such in the modeling space (as an entity), only the observation thereof. </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191372">@René Spronk</span> please excuse my naivete in this matter, but I don't quite agree with the statement that the tumor only exists because we observe it. The tumor is a physical specimen that is a part of the body (till removed), that has specific observations that can be associated to it (e.g. size, receptor status, mutations, etc.). The only differentiating factor between a tumor and other body structures (e.g. the heart) is that it is not obligate that all patients will have a tumor structure to be identified. <br>
The condition of "cancer" on the other hand exists only because of the symptoms presented as a result of the development of a tumor mass, and only exists when we "observe" it. But is this not true of all conditions?</p>

<p>We had some back and forth on that exact idea. Observation vs existence. If I remember my HL7 Standards class, the idea was that we don't ever 'know' in medicine, even with a gold standard test you aren't always certain. You might have a large tumor and symptoms of lung neoplasm. This tumor could be 3cm across, and some enlargement of the local lymphatics. Then you open the patient up and it turns out to be a giant ball of fungus, an aspergilloma. Yes we 'observed' a tumor, but that was simply what we saw on imaging, not what was true. </p>

<p>So our use case is kind of requiring a good representation of a tumor sooner than BodyStructure is available and I might profile BodySite to do so.  I'm just juggling code, qualifier and possibly an extension to represent morphology (either histological or gross in the case that no definitive pathology is defined). So my question is to those of you who are in agreement with this BodyStructure. Should code remain specific to the site, or should code represent 'what' it is. </p>
<p>code: apex of left lung<br>
extension: associatedMorphology: Large cell carcinoma (morphologic abnormality)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>code: Large cell carcinoma (morphologic abnormality)<br>

<p>or </p>
<p>code:  Large cell carcinoma of lung (disorder) [to me it seems a bit discordant to use a disorder code in a BodyStructure]<br>
qualifier: apex of left lung</p>

<p>I'm currently thinking of BodyStructure as a generic point of reference, where all other information about the tumor should point to. So, as discussed somewhere above, I would rather fill it with either some generic code for the tumor (like "breast cancer", "lung cancer" and so on) or an ICD-10 code (though that would rather be a condition).<br>
At least, morphology and location are just observations related to the tumor, but subject to change over time.</p>

<p>Ah good points, thank you for the replies. Definitely histology should be an observation. I'm going to keep the cancer type in the condition, have condition reference multiple body sites (including in the case of mets), with the body site code and qualifiers only representing the location. The active field will be used to represent whether that tumor still exists (or has been excised or resolved through treatment).</p>
<p>I'm wondering if a tumor being secondary should be denoted somewhere. M category shows that it has metastasized, and it might reference two unconnected BodySites, but in this situation I can't tell which was primary and which was secondary, particularly where it metastasized to the other breast or other lung (maybe something with timestamps but thats not obvious). Should mets be a second Condition? </p>
<p>Were you guys thinking 'kind' would be 'required' bound to a simple value set like [anatomicalStructure, morphologicalAbnormality], or an extensible CodeableConcept that an implementer could bind to a concept like 'metastasis from malignant tumor of lung'?</p>

<p>This feels different from the other places we've used "category" which is as a filter for user interface/software functionality - separating labs from imaging from vitals seems quite distinct from separating skin patches from tumors from fetuses.  To be honest, my real leaning would be rename BodySite.code to BodyStructure.location and then use BodyStructure.code to identify the "kind" of structure.  Seeing as the resource hasn't been heavily used that sort of radical change is probably reasonable at this time.</p>

<p>so looking at this again.  I thought the  intent with kind was to broadly categories the context for identifying the site.   so tumor, skin patch, bodysite which is how I dispositioned it. What does <code>kind</code> mean? </p>
<ul>
<li>a granular code for a specific morphology like a mast  cell tumor</li>
<li>a code to say its a tumor being tracked.  ( ie a categorization)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the latter - then I agree with Mark that the resource is lacking some more stuff like a human readable label ( " mast cell tumor -1" ) and a another element to say what it is we are tracking ( a mast cell tumor).</p>

<p>Code might be preferable to represent what it is, like morphology or just like benign neoplasm, lesion NOS, malignant neoplasm, fetus. <br>
It would be a bit odd to have code: uterus, kind: fetus. Most places in FHIR that I work with, code has represented the 'what'. Though this might make the 'qualifier' field a bit ambiguous. </p>
<p>Another point though is that the 'what' is subject to change with tumors, which was pointed out above. A nevus can become a melanoma, an in situ tumor invasive.</p>

<p>Be careful that the descriptions make it sufficiently obvious that the design supports the common case of specifying a location without saying that there is some abnormality there.</p>

<p>And probably make sure that qualifier is explicit that it qualifies location, not code. But that looks good.</p>

<p>Appreciate the earlier comments.  I preapplied the tracker for <a href="http://build.fhir.org/bodystructure.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/bodystructure.html">BodyStructure.kind</a> to give and idea what the proposed disposition would look like.  Note the new element is .code and the old .code is now .location with a bunch of cascading edits to the other elements to align it all up.   Not approved yet.   Feedback welcome.</p>

<p>Maybe "morphology" is a better name than "code", it is more informative. Also "code" suggests that this is THE central concept, but when specifying a location without mentioning an abnormality code/morphology is unimportant.</p>
<p>And "qualifier" should be "locationQualifier".</p>
<p>Is there a need for "morphologyQualifier"? I have no idea.</p>

<p>We're not necesarily talking about abnormalities.  Skin patches, fetuses, etc. wouldn't be abnormalities.  As well, we generally try to keep our terms simple when we can.</p>

<p>I think that "morphology' just means "shape", not "abnormal shape", and the offered definition for "code" is "morphology".</p>

<p>Morphology is subject to change, nevus to melanoma,  well differentiate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, fetus to whatever they turn into? Though it would be convenient to have that morphology in the tumor instance,  we were leaning towards having a tumor histology observation reference a tumor through the body-structure extension. Though I'm torn as our implementation would be a bit simpler if the histology was encoded in BodyStructure.code. I'm looking forward to seeing how the Cancer DTR group looks toward modelling BRCA. </p>
