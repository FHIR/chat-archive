<p>Whilst walking our development team through some of the intricacies of FHIR, I was asked a question as to what people use "Resource.implicitRules" for. Personally, I have never seen anyone use them in the implementations that I have seen, or in any remote systems we have integrated with.</p>
<p>So, a question to the community. Do you use the "Resource.implicitRules"  element? If so how do you use it?</p>
<p>thanks.</p>

<p>An equally important question - does your software check to make sure it's not set or is recognized so you know you can safely process the instance?</p>

<p>I have code in various places to make sure it's not true. I've seen use of it proposed on one context, but that was due to a misunderstanding, and it wasn't adopted.</p>
