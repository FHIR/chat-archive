<p>Is there a reason why type is restricted to only 1 value in Location?  Our use case is mainly for buildings so one building may cover multiple types.  Other resources do allow multiple types so I wanted to check to see if there was a particular reason that Location didn't.  Thanks!</p>

<p>Seems that usecase just calls for many Location resources. One for each type. </p>

<p>How is status managed?  If the state applies to all types, then it might be reasonable to do a 0..*.</p>

<p>So it would be appropriate to have multiple Location resources that are identical except for the type?  Any reason this is different than Organizations that can have multiple types?</p>

<p>The status would apply to all types.  Everything would be identical except for the type so 0..* would be easier.  I was just wondering if there was a particular reason for limiting it here.</p>

<p>There may be different coding schemes in place for a classification of a single location/facility.  I had thought type was the appropriate place to put this.  It seems odd to me to create multiple location resources for the same physical location. </p>
