<p>I made a uri to a profile for the Observation.value[x] element that made Observation.value[x] become Observation.valueQuantity. I realized that is the wrong approach and I need to slice this element. However, I cannot get rid of this setting and get back the original Observation.value[x]. None of the remove options are active and its looking like I have to start from scratch which would really be time costly. Anyone know how to undo stuff? In general I find it difficult to back out of a mistake or an incorrect decision. Any help in this department would be highly appreciated!!</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192228">@Brian Reinhold</span> Forge renames a choice type element (e.g. "value[x]") when the element is constrained to a single type (e.g. "valueQuantity"). If you reset the element types (checkbox at the top) to include all base types, Forge reverts the name back to e.g. "value[x]".</p>

<p>If you seem to be stuck, you can always edit (a copy of) the profile XML by hand.</p>

<p>Michel,<br>
I do not see such an option. I have selected valueQuantity in the structure definition in the left window (the only value option I have) and in the right window there is not option or check box by the word "Type(s)" at the top of the right window (or any other place either).<br>
I considered hand editing the xml but all I see is an element for the valueQuantity. If I remove that element, there will be nothing (at least with respect to a value entry). Will Forge re-create the value[x] element in the presence of nothing?  (I am assuming the original xml had something there.)</p>

<p>Okay I did it by hand. First I removed all the cardinality settings in the tool. Then in the xml I deleted the child &lt;type&gt; element which indicated that the value was a quantity. Then I changed the value element attribute to "value[x]" instead of "valueQuantity". I left everything else in place. That seems to have worked. At least I get back the value[x] element on reload.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192228">@Brian Reinhold</span> If you select a choice type element, then the Property window should let you customize the element type constraints (if allowed). Without inspecting your profile, I can't explain why Forge did not display type selection checkboxes. I'm not aware of any bugs regarding element type, but please let me know if this keeps happening.</p>

<p>It DOES when value[x] is present, but in my case only valueQuantity was present and there was no list of check boxes. I still have the xml that causes this problem. I can send it to you if you want.</p>

<p>Yes, please send me the profile XML. Maybe I can reproduce the issue and fix it for the next release.</p>
