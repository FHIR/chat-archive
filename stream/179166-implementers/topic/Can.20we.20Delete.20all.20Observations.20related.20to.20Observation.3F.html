<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I want to delete all related observations objects while deleting Observation from Server in a single call instead of getting related reference ids and make another call.</p>
<p>Currently if I want to delete an observation object, I am preparing an array of ids from related from delete observation object and deleting observation from server call. and after that I am making server call for deleting Observations of particular ids from related.</p>
<p>Is there any way to delete all Observations related to that delete Observation.</p>

<p>you can delete the related ones in one go if the server supports deleting multiple resources with a conditional delete: <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#2.21.0.13.1" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#2.21.0.13.1">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#2.21.0.13.1</a></p>

<p>More likely you'd be marking them with an appropriate status code (reason why they are going) rather than deleting them. And for that likely to be using a patch?</p>
