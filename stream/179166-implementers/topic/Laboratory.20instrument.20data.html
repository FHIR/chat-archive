<p>Good Evening,<br>
We are extending the ordering system of a Laboratory to include processes that will extract raw data from our Laboratory instruments for what is tested. This data will be used later in the calculations that will be defined inside of Observations tied to Diagnostic Reports. However, the way they come is in batches of results that might tie to many patients but in a singular batch. We need a way of storing this data to allow it to be verified before it progresses to the calculation stage as well as for Quality Control purposes. Any ideas?</p>

<p>I'm not quite understanding what the problem you're running into is.  There's no problem to have a Bundle of Observations that span patients.  Can you expand on where you're running into challenges?</p>
