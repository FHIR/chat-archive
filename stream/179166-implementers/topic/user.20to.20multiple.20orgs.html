<p>Good afternoon, other than FAST, UDAP and use of the Endpoint resource, has the issue of a single user (SMART on FHIR app) getting to other organizations being talked about?  I haven't seen CORS come up but doesn't mean it hasn't.</p>

<p>When you say "single user (SMART on FHIR app) getting to other organizations", can you give an example of what you have in mind? Certainly one app today can register with as many SMART servers as it wants/needs, and each user of that app can connect the app to any subset of those SMART servers.</p>

<p>Thanks Josh, I should be more specific.  This is really about is there a way to manage patient identity over the many SMART servers from a SMART app developer perspective.  And yet, they need to somehow access to longitudinal record - aka all episode of care that might span over multiple Healthcare facility [clinics, hospitals, labs, speciality facilities etc] - each one using a possible different EMR system.</p>

<p>Today the model is: individual user connects your app to their records at one or my source systems; you can GET a set of demographics (FHIR Patient resource) from each and use/reconcile the data from these as you see fit.</p>
