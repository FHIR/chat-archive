<p>Hey guys. I was wondering if there is any good way in FHIR to search through an observation object with sampled data in it, getting only the samples  after a very specific timestamp. For example, if I have some EKG data like in <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-example-sample-data.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-example-sample-data.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-example-sample-data.html</a> but want to search for data right after the effective date of the observation (from the EKG data example I gave, getting the samples after 9:30:35.23 AM, not after 9:30:35.00 AM), is there any simple way of doing that in FHIR?</p>

<p>If you're wanting to return an Observation that contains a filtered subset of the samples present in the stored Observation, the only way to do that is with an operation.  Search, by definition, can only give you the content of the resources already stored.  It can't transform the data that's in those resources other than filtering out particular elements (based on request or based on access privileges)</p>
