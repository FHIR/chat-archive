<p>I was talking to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="301665">@Steven Nichols</span> about dose reporting. I can see some relevant extensions in May2016 <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/FHIR/2016May/imagingstudy-extensions.html">https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/FHIR/2016May/imagingstudy-extensions.html</a>, and I can also see the "spreadsheet" file still in the current build at <a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhir/blob/master/source/imagingstudy/imagingstudy-extensions-spreadsheet.xml">https://github.com/HL7/fhir/blob/master/source/imagingstudy/imagingstudy-extensions-spreadsheet.xml</a>, but cannot find these extensions in the current build.  Did they disappear, were they deprecated?  cc: <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191703">@Claude Nanjo</span></p>
