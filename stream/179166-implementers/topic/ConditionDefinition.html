<p>Hi. ConditionDefinition says it doesn't follow any patterns, but it would follow the Definition pattern, right?</p>

<p>what is the difference /relation between ConditionDefinition and ClinicalUseIssue?<br>
If i wanted to say "this medication has an indication X", I' assume we'd have a ConditionDefinition for that, or at least a path to a ConditionDefinition.</p>

<p>ClinicalUseIssue is essentially the definition for a DetectedIssue (i.e. a contraindication or similar issue).  ConditionDefinition seems a little odd to me, but appears to be a grab-bag of "stuff related to Condition X"</p>

<p>ClinicalUseIssue just points to coded things but could have codeableReference if there are FHIR definitions of conditions. But ConditionDefinition doesn't seem to define a condition (or  a disease/symptom), but how to diagnose and manage one. I wouldn't expect that from the name. Maybe DiagnosisDefinition? Diagnosis has a connotation both of the process of diagnosing, and then it becomes a diagnosis, aka condition, which then needs management. Or Maybe DiagnosisKnowledge, because it seems more informational that definitional.</p>

<p>There seems to be some overlap (functionally). <br>
In some cases, this included, it seems that master data is spread around different resources - which is not a problem if that is how implementers do it, but I don't know if there is  one way that implementers do it.</p>

<p>the scope boundaries are not clear to me. ClinicalUseIssue seems more specific than the other, and is about medication, the other more general. I don't see this as something that is medication-specific.</p>

<p>I cannot comment beyond my baseline opinion about "knowledge" vs "definition": I do not think systems behave differently. To me, a non-native english speaker, this difference does not compute.<br>
If a system asserts some information about some type that means "here's what you should know about this type", that's a definition, regardless of whether this is "raw" knowledge (does that exist)?) or local, administrative or regulatory definition (which is a continuum and i do not differentiate). <br>
I do not understand / agree why we have xxxDefinition vs xxxKnowledge. And the first time I heard "knowledge" was from drug DBs wanting to add a buzz word for marketing points, so that marked me ;)<br>
Again I am not a native english speaker, so I may be missing some subtleties that most people will grasp. I just hope we keep things  a) consistent if possible, and b) on a continuum because silo boundaries are never fixed.</p>

<p>Definition of a contraindication and definition of a condition aren't really the same thing...  ClinicalUseIssue says "don't use X when Y".</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span>  ClinicalUseIssue is not the definition of a condition. It does not tell you what hypertension is (which would be its definition), but it tells you that a drug may cause it.</p>
<p>ClinicalUseIssue is, roughly, the assertion of a known link between a medication and a condition caused by its use. It doesn't define the condition, it just refers to it.</p>
<p>(It need not be medication, it could be a procedure etc, and it need not be something that is described with an actual FHIR Condition, but just some other negative thing e.g that it stops working properly)</p>
<p>Neither the word definition nor knowledge is perfectly, err, defined, to only mean one thing in all contexts, but there are some differences. "Continuums" and overlapping concepts are a fact of life but we do what we can.</p>
<p>Definitions tend to be more fundamental and about unchanging intrinsic things.</p>
<p>Then you can add other facts that are more about context and not so intrinsic.</p>
<p>It's fairly definitional that a tablet is made of a certain substance. If it was a different substance it would have to be a different tablet.</p>
<p>But its price and how it is used are subject to variation, over time and from place to place. So those are less definitional.</p>
<p>ConditionDefinition does not seem to me to be the fundamental definition of a condition, so that doesn't seem a good name. It seems more about diagnosis and management of a condition. If we did need something that was truly definitional, e.g. that hypertension is high blood pressure, then I wonder what that resource would be called.</p>

<p>mvn clean install<br>
docker-compose up -d --build</p>

<p>I think I understand roughly the difference, at least partially. ClinicalUseIssue is the set of relations that are defined/known between a medication and a condition (I like the fact it exposes relations). And ConditionDefinition contains other set of information (still seems definitional).</p>

<p>I don't want to say they are fully overlapping, just a bit of overlap and perhaps scoping would be useful. If I were to implement something like a catalog, before I raised this, I would probably start with ConditionDefinition, based on the name and scope.</p>

<p>Correct. Price is actually something that is asserted: some authority determines / defines the price  for a drug- so I would not call it "knowledge". <br>
If Definition means "intrinsic", i don't know how that will work - and I don't have a better word for that.</p>

<p>I do lean towards Jose's opinion that ConditionKnowledge would be a better label.  As used elsewhere in FHIR, Definition describes an activity that could potentially be instantiated.  Knowledge describes information known about a kind of thing.</p>

<p>I do lean towards Jose's opinion that ConditionKnowledge would be a better label.  As used elsewhere in FHIR, Definition describes an activity that could potentially be instantiated.  Knowledge describes information known about a kind of thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't remember having that opinion :) ... But I guess the boundary clarification is useful.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> we are at cross purposes, I am not talking about a contraindication being a diagnosis, but a ConditionDefinition being about the process of <em>diagnosing</em> - which is what it claims. ("...how the condition is identified" == diagnosis)</p>
<p>And yes both words ultimately mean knowledge but you can have knowledge about knowledge, right? ;-)</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> Yes, I understand the intent, but I am questioning the intent. <br>
If I hear the word "condition" I tend to think of it in the context of something needing managing for an actual patient (though I realise that is not the only interpretation). <br>
Whereas, say "disease", as an example, makes me think of the medical issue in the abstract. <br>
I assume this is not about the management of any particular instance of a disease (or other issue), but the disease in general.</p>

<p>True, but we are considering "ConditionKnowledge", because it really isn't a definition of a condition :-) Without the (inaccurate imho) word "definition", it sounds more like supporting information about an actual condition.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, here a couple of terms we needed to sharpen in a past project, not sure whether/how they apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>Definition: when we provide attributes about something, to define it. For a medication, this is the price, presentation, substances, indications...</li>
<li>Specification: when someone indicates a set of attributes to indicate what they mean. In a prescription, this would be the GP saying "Paracetamol 1g, box of 20"</li>
<li>Identification: when someone takes the set of attributes, and identifies what was meant. In a prescription, this is the pharmacist "Paracetamol 1g box of 20. I have a few of those, in capsules or tablets or ..."</li>

Intrinsic means a property of the thing itself, about its own nature or essence. "not intrinsic", or extrinsic, means the opposite, so perhaps information relating to a thing. </p>
<p>Definition is usually "intrinsic", by definition ;-) But maybe for your project you have intrinsic and extrinsic definitions. But since we have other words to use and "extrinsic definition" is a mouthful, using "knowledge" for extrinsic definitions seems helpful.</p>
<p>Your 2 and 3, specification and identification, in the context of medication, sound a lot like prescription and dispense, so maybe it is better to stick to those words, unless you really want to take things to a more abstract level.</p>
<p>Mothers say medicine, pharmacists say medication. And pharma tends to say medicinal product, because they are concerned with manufactured things, less so than an administered things. So those terms help keep the day to day meds resources separate from the others. </p>
<p>"Medicine" also refers to "the science of health", so is further overloaded.</p>

<p>in some languages we do have a difference between medication,medicine (medicinal product) and medicine (science). Since the EMA is called Medicines agency, I thought "finally it's there", but apparently i was wrong</p>

<p>Sounds like you need the RIM...</p>
<p>When medicines is plural the meaning is a little more clear. It cannot be the science. Anyway, we can discuss that forever. FHIR has made a choice, some time ago, and it's a reasonable choice, so we need to be consistent with it.</p>
