<p>In a country I am living, national insurance card has a registration hospital.<br>
I want to store the information in Coverage Resource, but I cannot find a good way to do it.<br>
What I want to store is registration hospital name and its class. (Class means the level of the hospital. For example, class 1, class 2…. They are defined by government)</p>
<p>Background: If a patient wants to get benefits from insurance, they have to go to the registered hospital first. After the patient is referred to another clinic by the hospital, he has to bring his insurance card and reference letter. This only way they can get benefits from insurance in this country.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>While this vaguely resembles the notion of a Primary Care Provide or General Practitioner, this sounds like something you would do in an extension.</p>

<p>Is it something you're familiar with happening in other countries as well?  If not, agree with Vassil that a national extension is probably your best bet.</p>

<p>At last, I decide to put that information in network property. I will consider using extensions in the future. Thank you for the advice.</p>
