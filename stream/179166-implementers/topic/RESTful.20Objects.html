<p>I've been creating some FHIR packages for the Flutter platform (<a href="https://pub.dev/publishers/fhirfli.dev/packages">https://pub.dev/publishers/fhirfli.dev/packages</a>). One of them is for RESTFul requests. I've been trying to create a way to enable easier querying, and I'm comfortable with what I have (create, delete, patch, transaction, etc) but not for searching. </p>
<p>I've thought about just letting anyone pass in a json map object as search parameters, but then I run the risk that they haven't formatted their values correctly (plus prefixes and whatnot). In the other direction, I could become extremely prescriptive, having a class object for composite, date, number, etc. That would include the value and any prefixes that were allowed. Something like this:<br>
class SearchDate{<br>
  DateTime date;<br>
  bool missing;<br>
  DatePrefix prefix;<br>
}</p>
<p>enum DatePrefix {<br>
  eq,<br>
  ne,<br>
  gt,<br>
  lt,<br>
  ge,<br>
  le,<br>
  sa,<br>
  eb,<br>
  ap,<br>
}</p>
<p>Then I would have a class for each resource that can be searched for, along with fields of lists for each value that can be searched for:<br>
PatientSearch {<br>
  List&lt;Id&gt; id;<br>
  List&lt;searchDate&gt; lastUpdated;<br>
  List&lt;searchToken&gt; deceased;<br>
  List&lt;searchReference&gt; link;<br>
...<br>
}</p>
<p>But together all of that feels pretty cumbersome. I guess I'm looking for some middle ground (or just some direction). Does anyone else know of an implementation that has done something like this that I could look at?</p>

<p>Pass the search parameters as simple strings - don't over-think it</p>
