<p>Hi ,<br>
I need inputs/suggestion on how I could save information addressing the requirement as described below using FHIR entities </p>
<p>Requirement is  : There are few lab tests that needs to be explained and offered by a clinician , which could be accepted/rejected by a patient. If the test is taken by the patient then based on results , clinician might take some action - like a referral or further tests or could decide that no action is required.  Tests can be recorded as Observation but how would I save the following elements in this workflow. </p>
<p>- The fact that Test was offered by a clinician and it was accepted/rejected by a patient along with a reason<br>
- Resulting action(s) based on the test results and <br>
- how should above information be linked to Test (Observation) entity </p>
<p>Thanks ! <br>
-Pravina </p>

<p>- DiagnosticOrder + Task + Communication<br>
- DiagnosticReport links to DiagnosticOrder<br>
- Observation linked from DiagnosticReport</p>

<p>As part of STU 3, DiagnosticOrder will be changed to DiagnosticRequest and will allow the capture of "proposals" and "plans" as well as orders.  That, together with Task, will allow you to capture a recommendation as well as its acceptance/rejection.</p>

<p>Thankyou ! Could I confirm that following needs to be captured as Task and not Communication ?<br>
- Test offered/not offered by a clinician <br>
- Acceptance / rejections by a patient </p>

<p>Task is designed for managing workflow.  Communication just maintains a record of what was shared.</p>
