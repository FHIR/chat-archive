<p>In context of <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-29263">J#29263</a>, Patient Care would appreciate implementer feedback on the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does your system capture the provider who diagnosed the condition?</li>
<li>Does your system capture the provider who is responsible for treating the condition?</li>
<li>Are there other types of participations that are captured for a Condition?</li>
<li>If any of the above are yes, is that provider captured as an attribute of the Condition or via a condition-specific CareTeam?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Condition.asserter is mapped to who.source</li>
<li>Condition.recorder is mapped to <a href="http://who.author">who.author</a></li>
<li>Condition doesn't have <a href="http://who.actor">who.actor</a> -- and that is what's being discussed in <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-29263">J#29263</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Our system captures only the provider that diagnosed the condition. It is a direct attribute of the condition.</p>

<p>If a condition was diagnosed as part of an encounter recorded in our system, then we do capture the provider who diagnosed the condition. For our use cases, this is often separate from the person recording the condition. Both of these are direct attributes of condition. We do not generally track the provider responsible for a condition as part of the condition.</p>
