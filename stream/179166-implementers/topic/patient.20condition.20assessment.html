<p>In one of our assessments, we ask patients if they feel better or worse overall from both a physical and mental standpoint. Is there somewhere to store that information other than just a questionnaire? On a similar note, the physicians assess whether a specific condition that a patient has is improving, worsening or the same. Is there somewhere on condition that this type of relative information can be stored or would that need to be an extension?</p>

<p>The first would be an Observation.  The latter could be captured using Condition.annotation or an extension on Condition or Condition.annotation.  My recommendation would be the latter as it allows for multiple assessments to be captured and you could provide both the string representation in the annotation and the coded representation with the extension</p>
