<p>We are looking at how to prescribe contraceptive tablets, as the contraceptives are prescribed in high volumes we want to be sure we are getting it right.<br>
So my question is we can prescribe a contraceptive as 1 tablet - once a day - for 3 weeks, we are OK with this. It is how do you specify having a week off from the contraceptive before starting the routine again?<br>
Any guidance on how other systems are doing this would be much appreciated.<br>
Thanks</p>

<p>I've seen in some implementations a Timing.code of 21/28 which was 21 days out of 28 days.  I think you can reproduce that with a frequency of 21 and a period of 28 days.  And then text on your Dosage to indicate.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192166">@Jean Duteau</span> , stepping back a little from this specific issue, I keep seeing questions about various complex medication timings. The emphasis is always on how to express them, and we usually end up with a way to say it. Have we considered the other side of the equation? Do we expect consuming applications to be able use these convoluted timings in some automated fashion? While it is great to be able to say things in this "language," it needs to be understood on the other side.</p>

<p>I didn't think it was possible to include examples in the Dosage data type so all of the examples are in MedRequest.  Ideally the examples should be in the Dosage type...if that's possible...happy to put them</p>

<p>You can't create examples of the Dosage type itself (except maybe using Parameters?), but you can certainly include hyperlinks from that page to wherever you've got example fragments maintained</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191380">@Elliot Silver</span>  totally agree. I feel that, in most cases, these complex or even mildly complex timings should fall back on text.  Although Dosage can be made to say almost anything, there is a valid concern that receiving systems won't understand those representations.</p>

<p>I also second the point <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191380">@Elliot Silver</span> made. We are currently looking at visualizing dosing information and a major challenge is just being able to cleanly identify and pick out the sort of instruction that can actually be  displayed in a UI that  is half-way readable. However, we work in in a multi-language setting, so free text is not great for us, either. Insofar as there are actually specific, more complex timing schemes that are commonly and broadly used, the easiest for us would arguable be to include them in the set of standard codes used for <code>Timing.code</code> (or have other large, but widely shared ValueSets for this element). The existing codes already overlap with timings that can be "atomically" expressed (using <code>period</code>, <code>frequency</code> etc.), there is even a nice table in <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#timing">the Timing documentation</a> showing the correspondence.</p>

<p>Yes, and there is a statement in the Timing.code definition that says that if a code is present, it is expected to be a coding of whatever is in the structured data.</p>

<p>Yes, exactly - that means that if I understand the code, I don't have to worry about details hiding the atomic definition.</p>
