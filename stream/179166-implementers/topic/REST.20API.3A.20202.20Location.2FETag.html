<p>I'm trying to wrap my head around HTTP 202. There is a very small hint that processing a batch <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#brules">MAY lead to HTTP 202</a>. HTTP 202 is only allowed for delete it seems, hence not create.</p>
<p>So, assuming HTTP 202 is allowed, and knowing that it would mean "The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not be eventually acted upon, and may be disallowed when processing occurs." -- would it be reasonable to assume that you could be unable to send Location and/or ETag at that point in time because you haven't actually processed the request into anything?</p>
<p>And if yes: can I truly assume my transaction bundle was successfully processed if a 202 comes back? I'm thinking no, because I can only say it was safely committing _for_ processing.</p>

<p>I believe HTTP 202 applies in the case of respond-async - <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/async.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/async.html</a></p>
<p>Given that response I would not expect a location or etag, and the response only means that the request was accepted for processing.</p>
