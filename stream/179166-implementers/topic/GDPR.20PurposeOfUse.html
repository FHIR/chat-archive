<p>I've been reading up on security labels and Oath scopes to see how one could support the necessity to convey 'PurposeOfUse' (GDPR art.6) in a request/query to a FHIR server.  Oauth scope (see <a href="https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.nl/2016/01/fhir-oauth-scope.html" target="_blank" title="https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.nl/2016/01/fhir-oauth-scope.html">https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.nl/2016/01/fhir-oauth-scope.html</a>) seems to be an obvious candidate, but currently that's not how SMART (and FHIR itself) recommend that it be done. I'm more familiar with SAML tokens, PurposeOfUse would definitely be a SAML token, so the question is where this would end up using OAuth.</p>
<p>For break-glass we have a  solution in the HTTP header (see <a href="http://build.fhir.org/security-labels.html#break-the-glass" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/security-labels.html#break-the-glass">http://build.fhir.org/security-labels.html#break-the-glass</a> ) - this seems totally out of whack with a desired general solution for PurposeOfUse. It seems to encourage us to ignore OAuth and convey the PurposeOfUse (whatever it may be) in the HTTP header. Which puts the burden on the FHIR server (instead of upon OAuth) to verify if this user is allowed to use the supplied value for PurposeOfUse. I'm not a security pundit, but it seems this simply wouldn't scale.</p>
<p>So would this use case indeed be best served by using OAuth scopes? If using SAML, would you agree that this would be a SAML token? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span></p>

<p>One perspective is that with GDPR two things are much closer:  "normal" use and "break glass" ( in the sense that "break glass" means "I want to have access to data that I did not have before and here is whatever-you-need-to-give-me-that-data).</p>

<p>Btw, in GDPR, the use of Purpose is more restricted when handling sensitive data (like healthcare data) but the mechanism is the same.</p>

<p>I mean, "Legitimate interest" is not a valid purpose to access healthcare data. But it is one among the purposes,and the machine should behave the same way for all purposes.</p>

<p>My initial goal is to resolve how "PurposeOfUse" is identified (as  code) in a request/query. If one (under GDPR) tries to use "legitimate interest" as a purpose of use related to a clinical resource, access (or: a token to access) simply won't be provided. But that's of later concern - first we need to find out how to convey the PurposeOfUse.</p>

<p>There are plenty of things that could make sense here, depending on requirements. Are you doing this in the context of an existing SMART on FHIR implementation?  Would you want to rely on the user to assert the purpose use, or the app, or both together, or either alone? Would you want to capture this purpose at the time of the authorization, or capture it anew with each data query?</p>

<p>Two examples of a potential solution: 1) just ask the user a question on the authorization screen, and capture the response, associating it internally with the access token -- in which case, no changes to the SMART protocol are needed because the implementation is entirely within the EHR system. Or 2) ask the app to pass along an additional parameter as part of the initial authorization request.</p>

<p>But if you simply want to log this information without needing to review it in a real-time gating fashion, then 3) putting it in a header for each API call would allow the  FHIR Server to log it (and logging/audit event generation <em>is</em> a FHIR Server concern).</p>

<p>According to (my working interpretation of) the GDPR, you have to provide the purpose you claim to have, and also you need to show that the purpose is lawful. For example if the purpose is "consent", you may have to show evidence of the consent. But I don't think this would be in an API call, right?</p>

<p>The where to put PurposeOfUse is not an obvious thing in an OAuth world. Just like it is not clear where one would put the security ROLE of the user. In neither case would one prompt the user. But, it is not clear. In normal business logic the purpposeOfUse and the user-role come from the context of the interaction. Usually from business relationships (the user is a cardiologist at this organization [static role], and right now is the treating cardiologist [functional role], with the purposeOfUse of treatment), ( the user is a clinical data analysis at blah-organization with the purposeOfUse of treatment quality and timeleness analysis).</p>

<p>In SMART, I would expect PurposeOfUse to become an attribute of the context. As I point out above it is 'context', like the organization the request is onbehalf of, or the user-role, etc.</p>

<p>What is important to include in the model is that the declaration of PuposeOfUse must be an assertion of truth that all parties can trust is accurate and will be upheld. (Just like the user, user-role, user-organization, etc...) This is why I put it into the token, rather than into the scope.</p>

<p>Lastly, yes we know that the break-glass that is in the spec today is problematic. It exists because it was written, not because it was a consensus decision. However, we don't have a better consensus yet. The results of this PurposeOfUse experiment will inform us.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> So in a SAML world the pruposeOfUse would be a SAML token; in an OAuth world this could be done using a scope or some other OAuth thingy (Oauth is no my strong point).

<p>In GDPR the PurposeOfUse may not be wholly derivable from the context of the exchange. After all under GDPR it is a classification defined by a law, which may not have a clearly defined (or 1-to-1) relationship with PurposeOfUse (as a value set) as currently defined in FHIR.</p>

<p>Josh, PurposeOfUse is a claim/assertion of how the data that would be communicated will be used. For most of our uses today "Treatment"+"Payment"+"normal Operations" would be the PuposeOfUse. In treatment scenarios it is often 'implied' by the interaction (The HL7 v2 messages come from X organzation so are "Treatment", or Y organization so "Payment").</p>

<p>Some systems treat PurposeOfUse just like user-role... this is why I brought up the question of how are we handling user-role in OAuth?  How do we know the GP (who is allowed to make observations), from a dietitian that is only allowed to view data to assure meal ordered fits dietary requirements?  I ask, because the assertion of the role of the user is just as critical to be a claim/assertion. Different in that user roles tend to get converted easily into scopes, thus don't need to persist into the security token scope.</p>

<p>IUA looks much like XUA because hat is all that we tried to do... given the attributes we(IHE) found were needed in a SAML assertion, where/how would they be communicated when OAuth is used rather than SAML.

<p>It's an interesting point. Generally claims in the id_token are claims supported (and signed) by the identity provider and communicated <em>to</em> the data-receiver (client). A purpose of use is much more contextual than a user's identity -- and the GDLR goal (I think) is to communicate a purpose of use to the data holder rather than to the third-party requesting data.</p>

<p>I agree, it is not a direct map to Identity (like structural role). It is more related to what the user is doing (like a functional role). SO it would not be part of an OpenID Connect assertion. So like cascading OAuth, it would be more of the authorization decision, than the identity decision.... right?</p>

<p>I was certainly thinking of a cascading OAuth context. This is primarily about authorization. Some (functional) roles may use certain PurposeOfUses, others may not (e.g. breaking-glass can't be used by billing clerks; "vital interest to patient [i.e. I have an ongoing care-relationship with the patient]" can only be used if indeed one has such an active care-relationship, which some countries maintain a record of at the national level [a PIP in XACML terms], so one can verify this). <br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> You're correct that this bit of GDPR information is of utmost importance to the data-holder, but there's is a level of authorization as to what values one could include (as a data-receiver).<br>
I would expect the casdading Oauth environment to at least make some sensible authorization statements at a higher level of abstraction, whereas the access-control-engine used by the data-holder upon receipt of the request will have lots more detailed information at its fingertips when making access control decisions.</p>

<p>I could see relying on an external identity server to learn things like "what is this user's name" or "is the user a licensed practitioner".

<p>When the user is the patient accessing their own data, the PuposeOfUse is clear -- it is a patient request for their own data.  This includes when it is an application acting on the authority of the patient. This also includes when an authorized family/guardian is acting in their capacity as authorized representative (See PATRQT)....... When the request is by a clinical user for a treatment use-case -- it is clear it is a Treatment PurposeOfUse (and likely payment and operations). ......  It is the other PurposeOfUse that we have not specifically talked about that are not obvious. We should get specific on these... We may find that these are not common enough to work on yet, thus deferring the solution outside of PATRQT and TREAT.</p>

<p>I think what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191372">@René Spronk</span> is looking for "GDPR Purpose" is a way to convey a 'string' that is understood by the Authority, such that the authority looks for reasons to authorize this user for that purpose. Once it determines that there is an authorized purpose with that 'string' and it does enable the requested type of data (the rest of the scope), for the requesting user (OpenID Connect token); then it can create a permit token containing a valid scope. This scope may or may-not be just like the requested scope.     I say 'string' because in the context of GDPR they speak of authorized 'purposes', they don't specifically mention the HL7 defined PurposeOfUse vocabulary. This is fine, since our use of the HL7 defined PurposeOfUse vocabulary is in either a tag (security tags), or in a CodeableConcept; where a string is just as good as a well defined HL7 defined code.     BUT, we need a way to declare a purpose (PurposeOfUse) in a scope request...</p>

<p>Ok that we need settle to declare a Purpose of Use. <br>
One precision: the GDPR concern is not as detailed as this discussion. It simply says that if a company has a mechanism to process or use data, that must follow a purpose.<br>
The impact of that on FHIR is simple: If there is an interface, the interface should be a)for a specific purpose and that purpose documented. b) The interface can serve many purposes and in that case the purposes must be clarified for each actual use.</p>

<p>The value set  for "GDPR Purpose" as implied by the legislation is fairly limited (e.g. it doesn't even discuss the patient as a user). So this certainly would have to be expanded/merged with concepts as defined in the HL7 PurposeOfUse value set.</p>

<p>Yep, we can have things like "patient accessing his own record" specialization. or "Emergency access because someone is at risk".<br>
From GDPR, what is relevant is to categorize the mechanisms that are in place, not each transaction. <br>
So if an interface supports patients to access their own records and also supports physicians in emergency situations,  for GDPR this is mapped to the 2 purposes.</p>

<p>yes PurposeOfUse is a different vector than Role. Sorry if I caused confusion. Role is a concept defined of both structural and functional roles... My point is that PurposeOfUse is, like FUNCTIONAL-Role, in that it is more related to what is being functionally done; and unlike STRUCTURAL-Role, which is more static definition of the user identity.   We have had PurposOfUse in FHIR from the very beginning.</p>

<p>However, I think that purpose of use is not an API thing; it's associated with coarser grained interactions for export of data - .e.g the server trusts the client to log the purpose of use when appropriate. I don't know whether that's good design, but that's how I've seen it working now.</p>

<p>So where we landed seems to me:  ( a ) the mechanism written in the break-glass section seems wrong, ( b ) IHE has purposeOfUse in the OAuth JWT, and ( c ) SMART is deferring this until next revision of SMART.  An OpenID Connect token should not be seen as appropriate as that is only about identity of the user, which might include structural-roles, but would not know about functional-roles or purposeOfUse. Experimentation, and experience might put it in various places.  In SMART it could go into context, near other stuff that is describing the workflow context. It could go into scope. It could be that we define specific cascade of OAuth where the Nth OAuth authority is responsible for assuring the user is authorized to participate in a specific worflow/dataflow/reason.  This might be the same as the consent OAuth authority (UMA), or might be an additional layer... Certainly at the GDPR level, purpose is very specific to authorization of reason for access (consent).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> In my view the use of an HTTP header to convey "Break The Glass" is not appropriate because the http header is not a security mechanism. The method of conveying break-the-glass, or any PurposeOfUse, needs to be done in a way that is testable that the user has the RIGHT to declare break-the-glass, and that the breaking of that glass does not violate policy, including Consent that might forbid it.     Having this in an http header enables malicious individual to simply fixup a http header and gain access that they don't have authorization.    However, given there is no good alternative at this time, it seems like this is as good of a experimental method as any.</p>

<p>In the case of SMART, the OAuth and the Resource server are tightly bound. The Resource server does need to confirm the token, and scope; and it then must enforce the decision (which means constraining results to the scope). But in this case the Resource server is not expected to make any decisions, just enforce decisions that have already been made (by the OAuth authority)....     This is a simplified model that can be done when the OAuth authority and the Resource server are tightly bound, like is defined in SMART....   This is not the only way to use OAuth, as you point out... and indeed in the case of IHE-IUA, the authorization decision is expected to be within the Resource Server....

PurposeOfUse needs to be considered in the access control 'decision'... that is the role of OAuth... where the resource server is responsible for confirming the decision is proper (not falsified), and responsible for enforcing the decision.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191372">@René Spronk</span> , et. al.: <br>
I'm late to this thread --Kathleen brought it my attention and suggested I share some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Like Roles, Purpose of Use is a hierarchical concept. Someone at a hospital requests access to a patient's record for the purpose of Surgery; in the broader context, this surgery is in turn for the purpose of Treatment. These are mapped to various level of granularity of business processes. Surgery is a finer-grained process taking place within the broader context of Treatment [*]. While we usually only care about restriction on the high-level purpose (e.g. HIPAA PoUs), more detailed purposes down the hierarchy exist and may be of importance from an authorization point of view. For example, in a research project at the Foothills Hospital in Calgary, Canada, I noticed that there was a separate consent form for using data for the purpose of Genetic Research.<br>
While the specific narrow PoU depends on the specific instance of data access and workflow, the broader purpose could be more static. For example, while the fine-grained PoU of each instance of data access in a research department can vary (e.g. basic, translational, clinical trial, genetic research, etc.) the broader HIPAA PoU of all these requests can be safely assumed to be Research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to distinguish between the list of Authorized PoUs for a client or a data element vs. the actual PoU for an instance of data access. The former is a type of policy; the latter is a type of attribute assertion. "This app is only allowed to access data for the purpose of Treatment", or "This record can only to be used for the PoU of Research" are policy fragments. "The purpose of this particular access request is Treatment" is an assertion. In the OAuth world, the former is modelled as a granted Scope while the latter can be a custom HTTP header, a SAML assertion, or an OpenID Connect claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The PoU as an attribute assertion can be self-declared or implied by the business workflow. As <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> suggested above, an App can self-declare its PoUs. In other clients, e.g. an enterprise system, it is possible to make this assertion automatically based on inference: "this request was generated in the course of a sample-selection process in a Hepatitis research project, THUS the PoU must be Research" (more fine-grained PoUs to further specify the type of research can also be determined this way).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While it is possible to trust the self-declared PoU by a client, it is also important to make sure these claims are within a pre-approved range of PoUs that are granted to that client. We can trust an App to declare whether it's making a particular request for the PoU of Research or Treatment, but there can be a broader restriction on the set of PoUs that the App can claim. These can be defined and locked down at the time of developing the App ("what type of data processing does this App do?"). These broad PoUs can be part of the public specifications of an App and can be verified and approved in the course of the on-boarding of an App in an App Store ("Let's check if this App really does what it claims it does"). Obviously, there is a limit to the extent of this verification, but for high-level PoUs like those in HIPAA, this could arguably work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the above, in our demo implementation, we had the Client present a JWT to the Authorization Server, issued by a trusted authority (e.g. App Store) who would vouch for the identity of the client as well as the PoUs for which it uses the data it receives. The assertions would look this:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>App ID: xyz.zyx.abc
Developed by: organization.1.2.3
PoUs: [TREAT, RESEARCH]
</pre></div>


<p>This means that the App store has verified that the App only uses data for these broad purposes.</p>
<p>Once the OAuth/UMA server receives these assertions, it checks them against the policies (in our case FHIR Patient Consents). For example, when a request from the above sample App is received, but the policies would only allow the PoU of Treatment, this would result in a rejection of the access request. In other words, the AS would ensure that all possible PoUs for which the client may use the data are authorized.</p>
<p>An extension (which we didn't implement) could expand this so that the AS would determine what PoUs the App is ALLOWED to claim in the form of granted scopes. In other words, instead of flat-out rejection of the request when the PoUs would not be authorized by the policies, the AS could issue an Access Token with a subset of claimed PoUs, e.g. "Treatment but NOT Research." <br>
When the resource server verifies the granted scopes of a presented Access Token [**], it matches it against the fine-grained PoU of the particular request (e.g. in the HTTP header or a self-signed JWT) to make sure the actual PoU of the particular request is authorized by the granted scopes.<br>
For example, a client that, broadly speaking, uses data both for Research and Treatment, could be issued an Access Token only granting Treatment. So, request instances by this client which are for the PoU of Research would be rejected with an "insufficient scope" error, while request instances by the same client which are for the PoU of Treatment would still go through.</p>
<p>[*] For an extensive and rather pedantic argument on this see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2629689" target="_blank" title="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2629689">https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2629689</a><br>
[**] We used introspection for liveness of revocation but this also works if the OAuth server issues access tokens in the form of as self-contained JWTs.</p>

<p>1. In the conformance resources (capabilityStatement), AppA says to server "Hi I am App A, this is what i support, and this is (are) my Purpose(s) of Use".<br>
2. At runtime, and depending on the declared PoUs, the server and App can choose what information to send, what additional security and authentication to work with. For example it may be that each call must have an explicit purpose, but for GDPR that is not needed.</p>

<p>Yes, PoU can be declare at many levels. If the app has only one purpose in life, then it can declare it when it gets the client_id.  One should always look to optimize, which in these cases is to move these kinds of policy statements up as high as possible. Often times they are declared only at the highest level (for example a DURSA that covers a broad set of applications in a broad 'domain').</p>

<p>Ok. For GDPR the purpose is declared at design time, not at run time. I think this corresponds to "only one purpose in life" - because if it is redesigned to have another purpose, well, then it needs a new purpose</p>

<p>Where did this land?  In our own use, we have need to override a slightly different business rule for which we'd like applications to SPECIFY that the are explicitly breaking the rule for a given request (rather than for all requests in a session).  Thus, it seems that the mechanism applied in the HTTP request meets the need.  Only users with permission to USE that capability can do it, and only in applications that have been designed to deal with it.  The application asserts it needs the capability with a scope, the server either grants or denies the permission for the "session" associated with the access token based on access control rules.  A specific request can override a business rule about query content by asserting a purpose of use that is consistent with the override (omitting patient identifier in queries to support a multi-patient query on patient associated data), but the request must also assert that it is being done for a given purpose (POPHEALTH for example).   Thus,  the application does not violate the business rule by a simple mistake (issuing a query that doesn't follow the usual requirements) without also asserting that "Yes, I know this query will get me data for multiple patients".  It seems that _purpose should be a token parameter on request to communicate purpose of use in the RESTful protocol.</p>
<p>I could work with how break-the-glass was written, OR, with a query parameter (or both), but there is a definite need in the case I'm experiencing to be able to associated purpose of use with a specific API request without having to reauthorize the application making the request.</p>
<p>What's the advice here?</p>

<p>Rehearsing a solution: <br>
If it's a predefined set of purposes, wouldn't it fall under the GDPR ruling that all purposes of use should be known? (if both ordinary and extraordinary purposes are listed). The extraordinary cases simply require an additional safeguard which is "only by individual request".<br>
And a parameter on the query would be appropriate for this.</p>

<p>so basically one method that can apply for break the glass or "normal, permitted" access? that I like</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191387">@Keith Boone</span> it would be good for you to bring this use-case forward to be developed.  I would agree that the method we have shown for Break-the-Glass is a general use method for communicating some vocabulary value. In this case it is a PurposeOfUse vocabulary value, but could be any vocabulary value. In your case you have a very specific meaning you want to convey, so would likely best define a custom vocabulary for that use. Yes it could work this same way.</p>

<p>However there are more more formally security methods. You could request a new OAuth token for the override purpose. Thus you would get a token specifically for that purpose, scope, and timeframe. This method uses security layers, rather than business rules.</p>

<p>It's still purpose of use vocabulary, in fact, the purpose I identified is defined in v3 ActReason (see <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/PurposeOfUse/vs.html#http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActReason-POPHLTH" target="_blank" title="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/PurposeOfUse/vs.html#http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActReason-POPHLTH">http://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/PurposeOfUse/vs.html#http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActReason-POPHLTH</a>).  The reason for NOT requesting a new authorization token is that it really is an occasional override for a single request that might be done by a service level actor.</p>
<p>The next part of my question based on Grahame's response has to do with the structure of the Category tag.  The example for break the glass gives<br>
Category: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/security-label#break-the-glass" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/security-label#break-the-glass">http://hl7.org/fhir/security-label#break-the-glass</a>; scheme="<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/security" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/security">http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/security</a>"; label="Break The Glass"</p>
<p>I would assume that the value of the first term is in the form <em>CodeSystemURI</em>#<em>Code</em> and that if I was to use POPHLTH as a purpose of use code, the Category I would associate with the request would be:<br>
Category: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActReason#POPHLTH" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActReason#POPHLTH">http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActReason#POPHLTH</a>; scheme="<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/security" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/security">http://hl7.org/fhir/tag/security</a>"; label="Population Health".</p>

<p>If my understanding is correct, I can tell you it was only a guess, because <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/security-label#break-the-glass" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/security-label#break-the-glass">http://hl7.org/fhir/security-label#break-the-glass</a> doesn't go anywhere (it's a 404), which I presume actually means "Not Found" rather than I don't get any information because I didn't have access or didn't properly express my purpose when asking for that URL ;-).</p>
<p>Another example for expressing request based purposes might be helpful.</p>
<p>I might also suggest that while Category is a nice HTTP way to express this, it might be better to have a token parameter available to any request so that they might also be included elsewhere that query URLs can be expressed but Category cannot (e.g., Batch/Transaction).  For that, I might suggest _purpose as a query parameter be defined to express it.</p>

<p>That URL is a valueset URL, not a code system URL.  I've been told (from V3 days) that value sets identify a list of codes, not a coding system.  The form you use works by accident (because there could be two codes from two different code systems with the same code but different code), whereas the form I used identifies a specific code in a specific coding system.</p>
