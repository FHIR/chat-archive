<p>The National Center for Chronic Disease at is looking to assess a standards-based approach for collecting and reporting in-patient and post-discharge stroke data from/to EHR.  We want to conduct a gap analysis of the HL7 FHIR resources that support stroke reporting.  I wanted to ask everyone for thoughts on the best approach to conduct a gap analysis of available FHIR resources for reporting?  Has anyone done any work specifically with stroke reporting and has resource ideas to share?</p>

<p>How would this differ from other registries.   like cancer?  Work is ongoing on building a fhir based cancer registry IG.   Last i touched base on that they were leaning toward a questionnaire approach.  ( e.g. SDC ) </p>

<p>it would probably only differ in the reported data elements.  do you have any information if they conducted an evaluation of available FHIR resources for cancer registry reporting pre-development?</p>
