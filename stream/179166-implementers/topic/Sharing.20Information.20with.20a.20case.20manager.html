<p>So would we then make a library of thousands of application patterns? If so, how is that different than what an Implementation Guide  does? Meaning, there is already a formal way in HL7 to define an Implementation Guide, what is the role for 'informative appendix'? I am struggling with the rule that would be used to decide what is worthy of an 'informative appendix' vs what goes through some other mechanism. There are plenty of blogged solutions, why is this one special? -- or are you just looking for a way to gather for the readership these plethora of blogged solutions (blogs hold much other noise)? How might we nominate an article? How might it be chosen or rejected? --- Please don't get the wrong impression, this is good stuff, and good question. I just want to understand the impact and opportunity.</p>

<p>This is a pattern - a general way of using the interfaces. That's quite different from an implementation guide, though one could imagine lots of implementation guides built following the pattern - but IGs as we do them (and IHE does them) are generally lower level than that pattern.</p>

<p>I don't know how we would decide what kind of guidance is worth carrying as informative appendices. I just felt, based on the feedback, that this was useful stuff that a lot of people reported was obscure</p>
