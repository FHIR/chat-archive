<p>There is a whole host of types of practitioners, including physicians, dentists, pharmacists, etc.  Where in the practitioner resource would the practitioner type information go?</p>

<p>Take a look at PractitionerRole, if you are looking to support specialty. Practitioner is the "identity" resource of the practitioner.</p>

<p>How do we define the type of the Practitioner if we didn't want to use PractitionerRole. Like this Practitioner is a nurse or dentist or doctor</p>

<p>You can indicate their qualifications on Practitioner - i.e. what licenses/training they have.  However, Practitioner would list <em>all</em> of their capabilities.  If you want to know what 'hat' they were wearing (or what organization they were acting on behalf of) when they performed a particular action, PractitionerRole is the only way.</p>
