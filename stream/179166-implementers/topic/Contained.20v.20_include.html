<p>During a recent FHIR training course one of the attendees observed "we use contained resources in a response (e.g. when GETting an Observation) because this avoids the client from having to fetch all referenced resources" - contained remains a difficult thing to explain to those learning FHIR, which may be a sign we need better wording on it. For this specific use case, as an alternative approach (question:) if a client searched for e.g. an Observation, could a server (at its own initiative) _include all resources referenced by that Observation in the response bundle? To me: yes, as long as the self link in the response bundle exposes this behaviour.</p>

Or put in another way: if a resource has either a <a href="http://logical.id" target="_blank" title="http://logical.id">logical.id</a> or a business.identifier, it shall never be a contained resource?</p>

<p>I'm nervous about automatically including data that the client didn't ask for.  First, it unnecessarily bulks up the response - with costs in performance and bandwidth.  Second, there could be privacy considerations around disclosing information that wasn't asked for.   However, it would certainly be good for us to be more explicit about how 'contained' should and should not be used - and to provide pointers to implementers on better solutions for those who are tempted to abuse it.

<p>Is it good practice to contain the items in a list in the list resource? That is done for the examples of FamilyMedicalHistory? e.g. <a href="http://build.fhir.org/list-example-familyhistory-f201-roel.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/list-example-familyhistory-f201-roel.html">http://build.fhir.org/list-example-familyhistory-f201-roel.html</a>.</p>
