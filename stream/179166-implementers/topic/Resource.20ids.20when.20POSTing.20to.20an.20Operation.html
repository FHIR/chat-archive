<p>When we're POSTing to do a RESTful <code>create</code>, the expectation is that <a href="http://Resource.id" target="_blank" title="http://Resource.id">Resource.id</a> will be omitted, as it'll be assigned by the server.  (We have exceptions to allow linking within a Bundle transaction.)  What are the expectations for a resource conveyed in an operation invocation?  Often the operation response will be a resource that will want to link to the request.  Thus it would be helpful if the request included an id.  In other cases, the id will be irrelevant.  Should there be a standard expectation for whether the id needs to be present or not?</p>

<p>I don't really understand this question. if you want to refer to it, it'll need an id so you can. But there's no rule that resources have to be identified to use them as operation parameters (and very often they aren't)</p>

<p>The challenge is that if there's no expectation and I get a resource without an id but I want to link to it in the response, do I reject the request because there's no id or do I generate one?  Should this be standard behavior or do I handle it in the profile for the operation inputs?</p>

<p>you can't really generate an id, but you can echo the resource - 'this unidentified resource is the one I chose'. or you can return an error and say 'bozo, i can't tell you which unidentified resource I identify as my choice'</p>

<p>but it should not be standard behavior - there is too much that is operation specific in this question</p>

<p>I'm think of something like Claim$process.  Send in a Claim, get back a ClaimResponse - which includes a Reference to Claim.  They could just fill in ClaimResponse.claim.identifier, but that seems clunky to me.</p>

<p>so reject it if it doesn't have an id, and document that it must have an id. And even create a profile...</p>
