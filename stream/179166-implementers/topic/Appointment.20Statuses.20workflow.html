<p>Hi all, I have following questions about appointment statuses workflow (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/appointment.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/appointment.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/appointment.html</a>)<br>
1. Can the admin(Role:Admin) move an Appointment directly from 'Booked' to 'Fulfilled' state bypassing the 'Arrived' state?<br>
2. If any of the Participant mistakenly marks an appointment to 'NoShow',  Can he/she change the status of Appointment back to Fulfilled?<br>
3. Can an admin/patient cancel a booked appointment?</p>

<p>yes, yes and yes. Site specific practices determine such things.</p>

<p>Exactly as Rene says. But to add a little further detail, depending on who the user was that made the change, and when the cahnge was made, there could be implications to billing.</p>

<p>For example if the client cancelled 10 minutes before the appointment, they will probably be charged for the service anyway (possible at a differrent rate)</p>

<p>Another very similar case would be if the appointment was in the client's home, and the worker was held up either in traffic, or at the previous clients home, and the worker had to cancel it, then the client likely wouldn't be charged for the service.</p>
