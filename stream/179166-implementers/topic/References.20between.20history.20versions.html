<p>What is the current thinking about references between old version of resources?<br>
If I retrieve an old version, is it expected that its references will point to the latest versions of other resources?<br>
Would I need to search the history of referenced items using lastUpdated, to see what it was linked to originally?<br>
Does anyone change references so they become version specific, when a resource becomes non-current?</p>

<p>The decision about whether references are version-specific is made at the time of creating the instance.  There's no expectation that systems will automatically update references after the fact (and doing so would break digital signatures).  So, for example, you might decide that references to Patient and Practitioner are version-agnostic, while references to Condition are version-specific when you're creating a new Encounter.</p>

<p>For practical use please note that Vonk nor HAPI (afaik) saves the search index for old versions of resources, so chained search will not work very reliably for version-specific references. How do other servers handle this?</p>
