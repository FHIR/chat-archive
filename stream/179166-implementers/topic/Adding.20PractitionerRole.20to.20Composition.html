<p>While working on CDA to FHIR conversion, I realized that we have no good place in Composition to store a Practitioner's relationship to an organization such as we have in CDA (author.assignedAuthor.representedOrganization). Practitioner.identifier.assigner seems to just be scoped to the Practitioner's ids and could include mutliple orgs not related to this document, and Practioner.qualification.issuer seems to be scoped to their professional certification, not their role in creating the document. </p>
<p>I created a tracker to address this, but wanted to hear thoughts on whether linking document Practitioners to their Organizations is a need for documents in general, or something that belongs as an extension in a profile. </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191393">@Igor Sirkovich</span> Yes, hence the title of the thread "Adding PractitionerRole to Composition" :). Should have made that clear in the text though, that what I am proposing is adding references to the PractitionerRole resource from Composition so that the role and the Organization the Practioner is related to are both reachable by traversing from the first Bundle entry in a document. </p>

<p>IHE noticed the same missing for author of a DocumentReference... this is all fallout of PractionerRole change late in STU3... normal maintenance churn.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> So I am guessing that if we make a change to Composition, you are in favor of a parallel change to DocumentReference? </p>

<p>Generally, if one needs to make a change to the header part of Composition, it should be considered if it is a useful change to DocumentReference. This is where these two Resources 'look' very similar, although their similarity is only at this metadata level. Any delta in this metadata level is likely not proper, and when it is it should be strongly justified. Yes, IHE has submitted a CP to add PractionerRole to DocumentReference author. I initially put it in as <a href="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13266" target="_blank" title="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13266">GF#13266</a>, but simply adding PractitionerRole may be the solution. The issue I have is that PractitionerRole seems overly complex simply to indicate what an actor's role was in the creation of the document.</p>

<p>It's important to remember that the role will be what hat they were wearing, not what function they performed.  PractitionerRole is used to link Provider person, organization and organizational role.  It can also include the appropriate contact and other information associated with that linkage.  All of that information is potentially relevant.  The only information that's not super-relevant is the period and status information, but frankly that wasn't terribly relevant when we referenced Practitioner either.</p>

<p>Closing the loop here, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>, I saw you post the following to the gForge tracker: "The workflow project proposes adding PractitionerRole as an additional choice to most of the existing choices of Practitioner|Patient|RelatedPerson|Organization|Device". We discussed this on SDWG today, and will likely go this route (adding PractitionerRole to Composition.author, Composition.attester, etc. We will likely vote on this next week. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> if you agree we will do the same for DocumentReference. </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191407">@Rick Geimer</span>  Didn't on SDWG we discuss dropping practitioner in favor of PractitionerRole? Maybe I was sleepy at the end....I  don't have a strong opinion but want folks to be aware that is on the table. </p>

<p>I understand the potential cleanlyness of only having PractitionerRole, but I think sometimes direct attribution to Practitioner is all that is needed. Question that would raise is if one must/should/must-not include a practitioner directly and indirectly through a PractitionerRole?</p>

<p>Practitioner is useful if the organization and role are already intrinsic (i.e. there only is one) or it's not known/not relevant.</p>
