<p>If you set ElementDefinition.type.aggregation to aggregation: "bundled" and  you would like to POST or PUT  an instance of that profile (with a reference where you've set the aggregation to bundled), are you obligated to send a Bundle because of this aggregation? Or is this constraint only enforced when you send a bundle? Sorry, the spec isn't clear to me.</p>

<p>Wait a minute.. just found this: "If the type is a reference to another resource, how the resource is or can be aggregated - is it a contained resource, or a reference, and if the context is a bundle, is it included in the bundle."  Spec is clear, never mind.</p>
