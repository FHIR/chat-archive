<p>I have the need to integrate a FHIR server into a modern cloud based architecture. This is a Java HAPI-FIHR server.  What I am trying to do is expose the FHIR endpoints as they would in say Swagger, using the OpenAPI specification. Is there a way to achieve this or is there a better way of exposing a FHIR server's endpoints?<br>
I tried using bobby-brennan's FIHR-Swagger tool, but it didn't produce a useful document. As a side-note my capability statement isn't showing any of its input parameters, just the method and endpoint.</p>

<p>we have code to convert a CapabilityStatement to an openAPI document, but it isn't packaged in a standalone way right now.</p>
