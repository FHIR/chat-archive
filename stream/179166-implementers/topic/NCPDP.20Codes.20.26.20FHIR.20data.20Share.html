<p>NCPDP has the codeset &amp; Valueset to use and its restricted to NCPDP members only with subscription. However, when used in FHIR resources, could we share the NCPDP code, Description and details  in a FHIR resource with an organization not a NCPDP member? Is there any restrictions sharing the NCPDP codes &amp; description along with other FHIR elements in a FHIR resources?</p>
<p>Example:  CairnBB IG we used the DAW NCPDP code.<br>
<a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/ValueSet-NCPDPDispensedAsWrittenOrProductSelectionCode.html">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/ValueSet-NCPDPDispensedAsWrittenOrProductSelectionCode.html</a><br>
The link defined in the page rout to NCPDP and it needs membership to acces<br>

<p>The rules around sharing codes generally don't change just because you change the syntax.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="195036">@Carol Macumber</span> . My question is specific to a transaction record. For example, When sharing an EOB records for a member we need to share the NCPDP DAW code with an organization (Not a NCPDP member). Is that allowed?</p>
<p>Or any organization receiving NCPDP codes in transaction data has to be member of NCPDP?</p>
<p>Per the description above, my understanding is the <strong>restriction applied</strong> to distributing the NCPDP codes &amp; details. That is absolutely understandable.  </p>
<p>I appreciate your help. </p>

<p>How would any organization know that any particular recipient of the data was a member or not, as of that moment in time? <br>
If the recipient of the data is the patient themselves, the patient has full rights to see (and correct) all aspects of their "chart" regardless of who defined the dictionary do they not? <br>
How would something so restricted make it into a public interoperable IG?<br>
There almost has to be some carve out somewhere that says, the author of the data must be licensed to author with it and any recipient must be a member to get the background info... But to prevent the distribution down to the smallest increment? <br>
I am not a lawyer, but I'm going to surmise that the "the work" means the dictionary in total, not the individual codes and definitions. Imagine that if every single word in the code system was then locked away. You wouldn't be able to use the word "medication" in your documents. Consult your corporate lawyer.</p>

<p>I am interested in clarity too. My understanding is that the patient has near complete access to the healthcare data created about them as a healthcare entity.  The creation and maintenance of that data will generally be the responsibility of a clinician / administrator. You would not want a patient modifying their actual diagnosis information, you just want to empower them to choose what information is shared. </p>
<p>In the event that the patient needs to make a correction, it will be important that the appropriate system receives the correction. For example, a patient may be looking at a downstream version of a clinical piece of data. Any modifications to that data would not be reflected in the correct systems (as needed for clinical decision support). Basically the patient would need to follow the old process of contacting the entity that captured the data incorrectly, and have it corrected there. </p>
<p>I hope I understood the intent of the question.</p>

<p>Hi Bapi, all. I've reached out to NCPDP to get an answer to this question. My understanding matches Daniel's, but I'm also not a lawyer ;)  Hopefully will be able to forward a response pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Hi all. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="248131">@Margaret Weiker</span> at NCPDP shared the following...</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing data that contains values from NCPDP code sets isn’t prohibited by the copyright. But sharing or publishing a full NCPDP code set and definitions is.</li>
<li>A party may share data containing NCPDP codes with a receiver that isn’t an NCPDP member. </li>
<li>A party that isn’t an NCPDP member may capture and later share data containing NCPDP codes with another party.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, Margaret wanted to emphasize that both the sending and receiving parties would be limited in their ability to understand and validate the information if they don't have access to the full code systems.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
