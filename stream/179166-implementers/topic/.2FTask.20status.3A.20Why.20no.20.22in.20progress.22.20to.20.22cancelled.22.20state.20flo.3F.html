<p>I'm looking at the /Task resource state machine, in the context of sending a referral (using /referralRequest). I notice that once in progress (or on hold) it does not have an arrow to the "cancelled" state. </p>
<p>What is the philosophy behind this?</p>
<p>In the context of referrals, it relates to when i put a referral into "in-progress" and when i leave it in "ready/accepted". I.e., if i can't get to "cancelled" from "in-progress", i have to wait until the patient is in my office to put it into the "in-progress" state (because otherwise i can't get back to cancelled, which could theoretically happen 1min before the appointment).</p>
<p>Also, it's not hard to conceive of a "hold" state that gets moved to "cancelled". Would we philosophically say if a task on hold gets cancelled, it should be completed instead (with some kind of cancelled business status)?</p>

<p>"cancelled" can only happen before in-progress occurs.  After that, you can only go to "failed".  It would however be reasonable to have a direct transition from "held" to "failed".</p>

<p>Alright, so from a "referral" perspective, I wouldn't put a "send referral" task into "in progress" while i'm in the referral work-up stage (i.e., looking for additional documentation, triaging, etc..).  I would keep it in "accepted/ready" until the patient shows up.</p>
<p>I will also enable going to "cancelled" from "hold" then in my workflow, thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span></p>

<p>In other words what i mean is that by this state machine, a "refer" task is "in progress" when i'm doing the action requested in the referral, but NOT yet in progress when i am doing the preparation work to provide the service requested in the referral.</p>

<p>Going from cancelled from "hold" would be a problem.  "hold" means "I've started delivering care, but paused temporarily".  "cancelled" means "I ended the request before anything actually started - i.e. no care was delivered".</p>

<p>We could potentially add a "preparation" status between "accepted" and "in-progress" if that were useful</p>
