<p>I've read the FHIR spec section 2.1.0.6 a few times now which seems to be saying that a client can request non-FHIR specific MIME types (like "application/xml") but the server will always respond with one of the FHIR MIME types application/json+fhir or application/xml+fhir. That's the behaviour I've observed from servers anyway.</p>
<p>This does create an issue accessing these resources from JavaScript in a browser (browser gets between the request and response). Since xxx/xxx+fhir is an unknown MIME type, most browsers will also require the allow CORS header. This would not be the case if the MIME type were application/json or application/xml, but the “+fhir” bit means the browser is overly skeptical about whether to allow it.</p>
<p>If a client could request _format=application/xml and get a response content type of application/xml (without +fhir) there would be a work around, but it seems the spec says the server must return application/xml+fhir.</p>
<p>Has anyone else run into this? Seems a pain to have to require the allow CORS header just for this.</p>

<p>Dont you require CORS headers anyway? </p>
