<p>Is there a FHIR  equivalent for the information that is captured in FT1-Segments of DFT messages in V2 (financial transaction) ?</p>

<p>Looking at FT1: Looks like you'd need most of the fields and would replace fields such as Health Plan ID, Filler Order Number, Perfromedby, OrderedBy and Payment Reference ID, with 'Identifier|Reference(resource)'. All transactions need to go against an Account.</p>

<p>Not sure I understand. I have system A (e.g. lab) that delivers some service (e.g. blood test). System B is responsible for billing and holds the Patient's Account. Now A wants to post a billable item (the lab test) to the Patient's account. So - what resource does A post to B?</p>

<p>This was discussed at length during the early periods of the analysis and although feasible did not reflect any running application that we could locate. Another way of looking at this would be to make Address a resource  because someone wished to update individual Addresses and not the entire Patient (this is actually a common practice and level of granularity in RESTful systems outside of Healthcare). <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191450">@Simone Heckmann</span> would you like to come to FM on Friday to discuss your proposal and outline the use cases for this new resource?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-email="grahame@healthintersections.com.au">@Grahame Grieve</span>: I answered the question above. There is already prior art in HL7. The service providing system cuts a Transaction which goes against the account. There is not a one-to-one correspondence between the services provided and billable items on the Claim - using the prior example: a woman may receive many (dozens) goods and services (procedures) while in hospital all of which may result in a charge for cost accounting, clinical item accounting, inventory, personnel management etc. And then a formal or informal 'grouper' mechanism issues a claim for a 'normal delivery'.</p>

<p>If someone wants to take the existing V2 / V3 finacial transaction as a starting point and model the FHIR version of that and bring to FM then great. FM has been clear that we had finite bankwidth and chose to work where there was visible demand on the FICR not the FIAB materials and we are working to complete the significant majority of those. </p>

<p>The FIAB 'account' resource has been started thanks to efforts by PA and the FM regulars have periodically reviewed and commented but haven't previously had the implementer bandwidth to structure and flesh-out the FIAB resources - which I think sould be done as a suite to ensure coherence.<br>
The FICR are primarily for exchange between organizations, whereas FIAB is primarily for exchange within an organization.<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-email="lloyd@lmckenzie.com">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>: when you are saying we have the notion of a 'billing item' resource you are referring to the Financial Transaction aren't you?<br>
@AndyStecheshin is correct, FM considered the notion of the line item as a separate resource rejected as: this didn't reflect the granularity of information exchange; or what systems did, and just created more work for the parties. </p>

<p>V2 DFT transactions are widely used in Germany and we will certainly need something similar for FHIR. The reason why I nominated Claim.item as a starting point was that it already reflects the structure of FT1 segments and will presumably fit well with the present use cases.</p>

<p>Yes the structure is similar, I just didn't want the differnces in purpose to be lost in the discussion. Also the FT needs to link directly to the account and probably to the issuing system as well (I have't looked at those specs in awhile).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191430">@Paul Knapp</span> To me, "billing item" is an assertion that points to (or from?) a service or supply and indicates the associated cost and/or charge.  There isn't necessarily enough information for a full financial transaction because the respective credit and debit accounts may not be known or declared.  If the expectation is to use a FinancialTransaction resource with the source and target accounts omitted, that could work.  Is the FinancialTransaction resource created yet?  I think that's what's being asked for.</p>

<p>Ok then - best to refer to it as a charge rather than a 'billing item' because it isn't directly related to the bill. No this hasn't been created yet as per my FIAB discussion above.<br>
Points to the creating service and the account. The accounts need to be known at the time or creation or resolveable later from content within the resource.</p>

<p>Agree the accounts need to be resolvable, but this may be a job that the financial system needs to figure out based on patient, department, type of charge, type of encounter, etc.  On the other hand, knowing the cost/charge for an item can be relevant for clinical decision-making and/or may need to be asserted at the point of care delivery rather than being left to the financial system to infer (though the latter can certainly occur as well.)</p>

<p>Would it make sense to have the new Charge resource reference an Encounter instead of an Account?  Systems would then determine which Account to post the charge to by checking which account is associated with the specified Encounter.  This can address cases where a single account is shared across multiple encounters (i.e. recurring series, or 72-hour readmission, etc.).  I agree that a Charge needs to *end up* associated with an Account (in the billing system at least), but there may not always be a direct relationship between the Charge and Account that the system submitting the charge would know about.</p>

<p>In discusssions in PA, the Charge (BillableItem is what we've been calling it to date) will definitely be linking to the encounter, we have been discussing if it should refer to an account or a coverage (think account is the current choice in the design)</p>

<p>The charge must eventually be associated with an account, otherwise there is no 'charge'. It may also be associated with an encounter. Typically the account is associated with the patient, or group of patients, and will include all encounters with teh provider organization.</p>

<p>Well, the "charge" must eventually result in a financial transaction.  That will certainly have accounts.  It's not clear that billing item needs to though - depends whether most systems do that or it's sufficient to link to patient/department/etc.</p>

<p>I had hoped that FHIR would include an Adjustment resource. Arriving at account balances appears to require more than the Charge and PaymentNotice. PaymentReconciliation seems to deal with bulk/batch payments. Am I missing something that accounts for adjustments?</p>

<p>We are talking about a "charge" not a "billing item". The "charge" is the Financial Transaction from V2/V3. Charges are dropped into an Account, Bills draw from an Account, but typically with some  processes (maybe human, or a grouper service, or other) to mediate between what has been "the charges" and how they are billed. </p>

<p>It must have the patient and It may well be appropriate to contain encounter, device, department of other contextual information in the charge transaction, I'm not disagreeing - but they aren't a substiture for Account. The organization may choose to populate the account information at any time - preferrably before the patient settles the account.</p>
<p>I have said nothing here about whether the client or the server should determine that information, nor what back-end services should be handled by the server or to server supporting services which will interact as clients.</p>

<p>Great discussion, very valuable.<br>
I would see it like this: performed services are linked to encounters in the subsystem or clinical system (this is what happened in reality).<br>
How they then get grouped together for billing (in terms of charges) and to which account they are billed to is then something is determined by an accounting system. <br>
Not sure what you (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191430">@Paul Knapp</span> ) mean by billing items: is this the performed services? They then could be mapped to a single charge for an inpatient DRG case, right?</p>

There's a string value Claim.insurance.preAuthRef, but it seems like a placeholder, and that an EligibilityResponse reference similar to coverage or claimResponse would be appropriate.<br>

<p>If there is a need to provide a reference to an EligibilityResponse it could be provided as a resource reference in Claim.information. </p>
<p>What is the business purpose for this? Is there a concern that a provider may send an EligibilityRequest to determine whether a person has coverage at some point in time, either a simple 'is this coverage in force' or 'does this coverage cover this class of services' and receive a positive response. And then at some later date a claim is submitted and denied due to lack of coverage? If so the frequency of this is so rare that it wouldn't warrant sending the Payor's eligibilty response back to them on each claim, rather you may wish to quote that response in the event the claim is denied.</p>

<p>Claim.information is a bit more generic.  We generally try to have more specific associations for things like "why".  The notion of supporting information is more for "here's extra stuff that may be relevant when you're trying to execute".

<p>Thanks, that's helpful - we're trying to understand the best approach to the workflow.  It sounds like we don't need eligibility at all, but looking at claim in greater details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pre-Authorization - where the provision of goods and services is proposed and either authorization and/or the reservation of funds is desired.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we want pre-authorization, would this be a reasonable approach?<br>
  - submit a claim with a minimum amount of information such as insurer, organization, practitioner, patient, and use=proposed<br>
  - stop If the claim response includes an error that  the patient isn't covered or eligible<br>
  - send a more complete claim including the proposed treatment details if the claim response includes an error requiring more information <br>
  - if the proposed claim is approved, then proceed with treatment, and follow up with a complete claim including preAuthRef to the proposed claim.</p>

<p>This sounds like the way the resource is designed to work, yes.  The fact preAuthRef is a string rather than a Reference is a little weird as in a pure RESTful world, you should be able to traverse to it and the design should aim for REST support, even if that paradigm isn't yet common in the claims space.  The element definitions should make clear how they're used for full claims as well as pre-auths and pre-determinations</p>

<p>If you want to perform an eligibility check then send that and behave in accordance to the response (if Eligibility is a supported resource) otherwise you would send in a claim. If you want to send a pre-authorization then send in the complete question including the services to be provided not a light form of the question.</p>
<p>On pre-determinations and pre-authorization the service date would not required but may be provided as an estimated date and the payor may indicate whether coverage is know not to be inforce on that date.</p>
<p>Correct, Claim.information is where the various forms of 'exceptions' are captured.</p>
<p>The Claim resource is the base model from which it would be expected that jurisdictions or usage communities will develop profiles which will set cardinality and bindings. Often they would set different profiles for different types of business: vision, inpatient, pharmacy, dental etc..</p>

<p>so the workflow would be to post a Claim, and then have a ClaimResponse returned when processing is complete (provided it's "fast enough")?<br>
The wording <a href="http://build.fhir.org/http.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/http.html">http://build.fhir.org/http.html</a> implies a ...Response is appropriate synchronously:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These interactions are performed using POST, PUT or PATCH, and it may be appropriate for a server to return either only a status code, or also return the entire resource that is the outcome of the create or update (which may be different to that provided by the client).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The alternative workflow could be an async ...Response posted back to the server, but that requires authentication in both directions.</p>
<p>The outcome=partial also implies a requirement for further communications.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191791">@Daniel Lanphear</span> in the FHIR REST exxchange paradigm a POST to Claim would return either the stored resource or the id of the stored resource (as per the specification). In order to return a ClaimResponse, you would need to use either an operation (I am not that one has been defined for this at this point in time) or some other exchange paradigm (such as SOAP). At various Connectathons, the different exchanges have all been proved. In a pure FHIR REST you would POST to Claim and then query (GET) against ClaimResponse using the created Claim id.</p>
<p>In many jurisdictions, claim processing is indeed 'fast enough' and the majority of claims can and are processed in 'real time'. Hope this is helpful.</p>

<p>There are lots of workflow options (check out the workflow page to see them :&gt;).  Some support synchronous responses, others allow for asynchronous.  The workflow designs (whether for financial or other resources) don't make any presumptions about how the workflow itself is managed.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191791">@Daniel Lanphear</span>: The ClaimResponse is a response to the Claim regardless of whether the Claim is Created, or submitted, or a parameter or some other means is used to exchange the Claim content. The 'partial' is because in some situations a ClaimResponse conveying partial adjudication may be conveyed from the payor to the provider - but if that occurs it doesn't alter the fact that the final 'complete' ClaimResponse will state the adjudication for all Claim.items regardless of whether they have been previously reported on.  Yes, frequently claims are required to be processed in real time, for example pharmacy, in which case a Request-Response transport of the same Claim and ClaimResponse would commonly be used but a jurisdiction could also implement the FHIR REST paradigm and these various exchanges have been tested/demonstrated in many Connectathons.</p>
