<p>The attribute payloadType is currently 1..* in Endpoint, with the description "The type of content that may be used at this endpoint". We are using Endpoint to implement an application service registry and have a use case where an application needs to be added to the registry, but it doesn't support any (active) services yet. Since we use payloadType to specify the type of service, we run into a situation where we have an Endpoint (with status=suspended) but no payloadType to list with it. Wouldn't it be better to have payloadType be 0..* and have a rule to say that it shall be populated when status=active?</p>
