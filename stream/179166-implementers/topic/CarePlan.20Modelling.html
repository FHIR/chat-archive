<p>Hi , I have a question on CarePlan resource, we are planning to build a care plan management product in our EHR,  the following is how we are trying to model this: <br>
a) We first build a library of careplans that contain the condition that each of them addresses along with the set of activities that are prescribed to bring the condition under control and also meet the goals that are defined to address the condition.<br>
b) Each of the care plans defined at the library level are carefully devised so that each meet a specific purpose and one does not eclipse or mimic another careplan.<br>
c) Now, when a patient is diagnosed with a specific condition/conditions, a care plan for each of the condition is derived from the library we have built in above steps. So a patient may endup with one or more careplans derived from the library. Each of the derived careplan has a reference to the library careplan and this will enable us to support analytics.<br>
d) An individual care plan is a mirror image of the library careplan with the activities curtailed to the individual/patient specific condition. The goals may also be modified to suit the patient's condition.<br>
e) Now if we have a situation where we need to have an activity for a patient which is not defined in library, we first add the activity to the library and then derive the individual plan.<br>
f) We also have a use case wherein as part of the careplan the condition is monitored via the Labs/procedures (actionResulting) and that keep the goal in check</p>
<p>Please let us know if you see any flaw/issues with this model and also any suggestions comments are welcome.</p>

<p>The CarePlan resource supports modeling a specific care plan for a particular patient or group, and it sounds like what you're trying to define here is a definition of a CarePlan. The PlanDefinition resource is intended to support that use case, so the library of careplans you are referring to would be a set of PlanDefinition resources, and applying one of those to a particular patient would then produce a CarePlan.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Ok, so Plandefinition for the definition and CarePlan for the individual looks<br>
apt. We have one more usecase where we want to group the set of clinics that<br>
provide/participate in the careplan.We looked at the group resource but it does<br>
not have location as one of its member.  Should we go with an extension for<br>
group to accomodate the location or should we use healthcare service to make<br>
this association but looks like it complicates more than it solves the problem?<br>
Or should the association be made from the Practitioner (Part of CareTeam) via the role in a location(clinic)?<br>
Please advice...</p>

<p>It seems like that would always just be inferred based on the practitioners involved. Would it ever be the case that a location could be involved with the CarePlan but no practitioner from that location would be?</p>

<p>You could have a preferred pharmacy or something referenced in a CarePlan but the pharmacy isn't involved in the maintenance of the CarePlan and you wouldn't identify any particular practitioner</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span> ,Yes, in a realistic scenario a clinic may have been enrolled in providing a careplan and a user/practitioner is still not assigned. It could also be a case where an existing practitioner may have resigned or left and the clinic is yet to appoint one in his place.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> , Hi, so are you suggesting that the grouping of clinics offering a CarePlan can be supported by Organization?

<p>In FHIR terms, the clinics aka locations are Organization resources while Location is rather about the physical place.<br>
As Grahame pointed out, the clinic may move down the road but is still capable of supplying the care plan.</p>
<p>Your use case sounds like an extension to me that would extend PlanDefinition, containing references to Organization resources and having a cardinality of 0..* (maybe 1..*, if you can ensure there is always at least one clinic that is able to provide any PlanDefinition).<br>
From that list, the application will let the user choose, eventually resulting in the chosen organization becoming managingOrganization of the CarePlan's CareTeam.</p>

<p>Hi, We are trying to use Plandefinition as a library of CarePlans and dervie CarePlan that could be associated to each individual patient. A CarePlan has Goal, Condition and activity , I am trying to map these to PlanDefinition so when a Patient is enrolled we can scope a Careplan from the PlanDefinition. I assume that the activity in CarePlan could be mapped to ActivityDefinition in PlanDefinition. The Condition could be mapped to condition in actiondefinition. I am struggling to map Goals... I looked at requiredBehavior but it is just a code , any ideas or corrections about these thoughts is appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>The documentation for the Goal resource indicates it's intended to support description of a Goal with respect to a specific patient, so it might not be the best fit for describing goals on the PlanDefinition. That being said, I think you're right there isn't a good place to express that sort of thing on the PlanDefinition right now. So yes, submit a request to GForge I think, and if you can include a specific example of a Goal you are trying to represent, that would be very helpful. Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi, The CarePlan has a relatedPlan reference to CarePlan, would it also make sense to include PlanDefinition in the realtedPlan so we can keep track of the PlanDefinitions from which we have derived this CarePlan. I know that there is a reference to PlanDefinition in the activity detail but that seems to be at a lower level in the hierarchy... The usecase here is when we create a CarePlan from a PlanDefinition, the CarePlan would be in the initial phase of plan definition where only few activities may be asscociated with the CarePlan based on the triggerdefinition and condition. As the CarePlan gets updated with it's current activities it will be ready to move on to the next phase where the CarePlan needs to be associated with other set of activities defined in the plandefinition again based on the trigger and condition. So we require a reference to PlanDefinition so whenever an update/event happens we can go back to the plandefinition and perform the next sequence of actions...</p>
