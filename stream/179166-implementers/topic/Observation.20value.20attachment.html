<p>Hello,<br>
I would like a proposal/solution about the preferred way to create a specific resource after the decision to remove valueAttachment from Observation resource (the change in tracker is here <a href="https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_id=677&amp;tracker_item_id=13421" target="_blank" title="https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_id=677&amp;tracker_item_id=13421">https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_id=677&amp;tracker_item_id=13421</a>).</p>
<p>I have a scenario in mind:<br>
I want a resource that it is not Media resource (not a photo or video) and not a document (e.g. pdf) it is an file with relatively high sampling rate (1sample/sec) that is unpractical to create distinct resources for a period of time (e.g. 5 minutes).<br>
valueSampledData works well if the sampling rate is fixed.<br>
if the sampling rate is irregular (e.g. continuous heart rate measurements ) use of valueAttachment could be a solution using timestamp,value pairs as csv or any type of binary.</p>
<p>What is the preferred way to handle this situation?</p>

<p>Thank you for your responses, <br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span>  Using string could be a solution for the specific case since more or less the format of the csv must be agreed outside of the resource description, on the other hand attachment.contentType(text/csv)  is very valuable property of the resource and can help in automatic management of the resource.<br>
Regarding the conversion of the signal to a fixed frequency sampled signal this solution requires significant effort since the procedure requires interpolation and resampling since even if we determine the maximum sampling frequency of the signal adding NULL to non sampled timepoints we can not guarantee that the samples align to the resulting timepoints.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span>  Using different observations is a semantically correct solution but performance-wise is very impractical (i.e. in a scenario that we want to exchange an hour of the aforementioned heart rate measurements we would need ~4800 requests.<br>
Regarding Sequence does not solve the problem for two reasons A)semantically Sequence is too narrow to "genetic sequence information" ,<br>
b) but even if we ignore that Sequence.observedSeq is merely a string not providing additional semantics.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> I may be missing additional conversations but just by reading the tracker item of the decision to remove valueAttachment is not clear to me the rationale behind that decision. My humble personal opinion is that introduction of Media does not necessarily require the removal of attachment from observation.</p>

<p>So <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196809">@Vassilis Kilintzis</span> you are trying to record EKG? I have previously modeled a FHIR Resource from the IEEE 11073. I did this when I was part of GE, but couldn't get GE to endorse the proposal to FHIR as a Resource.  If this is what you are interested in, I still have the model. It would need to be proposed and sponsored by an appropriate workgroup.</p>

<p>Thank you John (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> ), but i would prefer the flexibility of the DTU3 observation resource with valueAttachment and let the profile/extension mechanism to describe the exact nature of the resource. </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  i believe that at some point valueAttachment will return, since we can not predict all possible payloads beforehand.</p>

<p>The ECG/EKG model I did was not a replacement for Observation. There would still be an Observation based on the data. What the IEEE model does is record the details of the ECG/EKG in sufficient detail that it can be used in future analysis comparing past and present. Much like an ImagingStudy, or Sequence.</p>

<p>How is a csv  file fundamentally different from a pdf image.   They are both documents in my mind and Media would work.   Otherwise you are adding back into observation this ambiguity of when to use which resource each time you come up with an attachment.</p>

<p>I think you are not thinking about the full potential of an EKG, but rather are thinking only about a simple resting-EKG. Even a resting-EKG can reach a Meg bytes in size. But there are Stress EKG that far exceed that and reach the size of a CT exam (hence why DICOM is one of the standards defined to hold the raw EKG data).</p>

<p>EKG has a few standards based formats (Not printed form which most clinicians see). The raw data is only ever processed by AI (Serial Comparison) code -- which compares last-previous with current; or by algorithm that looks at just this waveform (e.g. 12sl). This raw format is proprietary format originally written by Marquette Electric, now owned by GE.  This format has been re-architected in IEEE under 11073 standard as the abstract model. That abstract model has an encoding in DICOM.</p>

<p>Hi John,<br>
My point wasn't to focus on EKGs.  It was to deal with the fact that there are a number of Observation types where the end result is binary data that is not an image, video or sound recording.  That information needs to have a mechanism for it to be stored.  I'm fine if the decision is for that to be Media.  I'm fine if the decision is to add an extension to Observation to allow valueAttachment until such time as we can put valueAttachment back.  I'm not ok with the notion of using DocumentReference for such a purpose though.</p>

<p>I am not trying to extract measurements out of Observation. I would agree that where measurements exist they should be enumerated in Observation. I am just observing that sometimes the source for that Observation is only available as a blob of bytes that have a mime-type and thus need metadata (DocumentReference resource purpose) to describe and provide a handle for Observation to point at. DocumentReference is only (lowercase) document based in that it must point at a blob that has a mime-type... just like the word document means in the http world.  DocumentReference is not constrained to (uppercase) Document as is defined and described by HL7 structured documents workgroup.</p>

<p>the inspiration for DocumentRefenence is much wider than Structured Documents definition of "Document". Hence why ownership by Structure Documents workgroup is not the best fit for DocumentReference (and DocumentManifest). Would ownership by OO or FHIR-I help get this clarity?

<p>so this discussion has been pretty unfocused, it seems to me, now that I'm catching up on it. </p>
<p>I have several questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>if DICOM has a format for EKG, why would also do one? </li>
<li>I would've thought that this would be DiagnosticReport.imagingStudy</li>
<li>why specifically do we want an observation? If your answer is yes, why hasn't this been an issue or other kinds of imaging? </li>
<li>I do not think that the correct answer here is to make DocRef ever more generic and central</li>
<li>Nor do I think that media should be made more generic</li>
<li>I suppose we could take the EKG format on directly... but they are very large, and there are existing formats... so it seems low yield to me</li>
</ul>

<p>EKG isn't the focus.  I care about EKGs, genetic files,  tummy bands for pregnant moms and all other sorts of observation results that can't be expressed as a single Quantity but which certainly aren't "documents".  In the past, I'd have said "send those using Observation.valueAttachment", but that doesn't exist anymore - and there doesn't seem to be an adequate alternative.</p>

<p>so, back to what Lloyd said... I am possibly distracting from Lloyds point, saying that when one has something beyond a single Quantity one should have one choice. It is not clear that choice should only be Media, but what about DocumentReferenece.  Media and DocumentReference need to be rationalized, harmonized, or homogenized.   I would like to see them merged into one blob describing resource</p>

<p>If they can't be merged, then we need a distinction that is clear.  Today, Lloyd seems to see a distinction that Media can be used as input to an Observation, but DocumentReference can NOT be used as input to an Observation. That is not a distinction.</p>

<p>I'm fine with Media being made broader.  I'm fine with ValueAttachment coming back.  However, getting rid of valueAttachment and leaving Media tight means there's a lot of stuff we can't express anymore, and that's a problem.</p>

<p>Although i understand <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span>  's reason that all binaries can be viewed as media so valueAttachment is obsolete i am with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  that not every media is actually video or photo. Making media semantics more loose to accept other types of blobs would solve the issue (although several fields are not applicable for all non video/photo blobs e.g. Media.view or Media.bodySite) . Also keeping valueAttachment with comment to avoid using for videos or photos could solve the problem.</p>

<p>And I am happy with the model as it is today with <code>derivedFrom</code> supporting DocumentReference, ImagingStudy, Media, Sequence, QuestionnaireResponse, and other Observations. This seems most logical to me. All of these could be source material for -this- Observation.</p>

<p>I would indeed like to see Media and DocumentReference resolved. Either more clear separation, or merging.  Today they overlap too much. Yet there seems to be some unsaid reason why Media is preferred in Observation land over DocumentReference.</p>

<p>I will agree with the text found currently in Observation regarding use of Media, DocumentReference, and ImagingStudy. It seems evenhanded.  I guess it might be useful to mention PDF is the boundary where move to DocumentReference over Media is appropriate. Overall I would like the community to help by reviewing these all and help add clarity based on what we all know, as new readers don't know what we know.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196877">@Mariano Garuz</span> Given STU3, Observation.valueAttachment is your only choice. However you see the spec has evolved based on community comments so that your use-case in R4 (ballot)be Observation.derivedFrom pointing at DocumentReference pointing at Binary with your PDF. This change between STU3 and current is the crux of the discussion in this thread. I think the argument is what goes into the .value element to be the primary observation in this case.  .derivedFrom is a good element, with good flexibility. The hope is that one can extract out useful elements from the PDF to fill sufficient elements in Observation so that one has a useful Observation.</p>

<p>So <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> is this your point? Where the 99% of the observation is in a PDF and will not be extracted out into useful elements in the Observation (such as this PDF of the ECG)?  In this case I would agree it does seem odd to have a Observation that is mostly empty except for a category, code, and derivedFrom; that points at a DocumentReference that points at a PDF. Where interpretation is extracted and the Observation is more a coded extract of the PDF, this feels less bulky. But I would agree that if the Observation is minimally populated, this is messy. My first point is that it should not be disallowed, which I understood you to be saying. That said, this does seem to argue for valueAttachment for specific use-cases.</p>

<p>What was discussed? What was concluded?   There have been many things discussed on this thread.    <br>
the elimination of valueAttachment has no obvious replacement except for derivedFrom. I have expressed how that is not a reasonable replacement.</p>

<p>I can follow that idea, but derived from has a different semantic meaning than putting in Binarys or links to them directly into valueAttachment.</p>

<p>yes, I eventually came to that conclusion too. Seems we need valueAttachment, with clear scope that it is for when the attachment 'is the observation'. Or have something like valueReference that can point at Media, DocumentReference, ImagingStudy, or Sequence.</p>

<p>OO made the decision to drop valueAttachment with the presumption that Media would handle all of those cases.  But they didn't open up Media to handle all the cases that valueAttachment supported.  At this point, reverting the valueAttachment isn't possible without yanking Observation from Normative for R4.  So that leaves two choices - add an equivalent of valueAttachment as an extension or expand the scope of Media.</p>

<p>DocumentReference fits this very nicely. What is it that doesn't fit?  I am continually frustrated at the growing overlap without a distinction between Media and DocumentReference. I am sure most of this is caused by the names of the two resources; as their normative scope and usage are clear and distinct.</p>

<p>DocumentReference has major issues.  The name does not reflect its ever-evolving scope.  I do however think there's a major difference between an "indexing" resource (which is what DocumentReference is) and an Observation - which is a point-in-time statement.  DocumentReference should always be a reference to a something.  We still need a resource for the "something" when we're talking about a complex observation that's not media.</p>

<p>Yeah, we've certainly discussed that before.  The way it's documented doesn't limit it to being <strong>exclusively</strong> a grouper (in my opinion) - the second sentence describes it as "A Composition defines the structure and narrative content necessary for a document."  So at least there's some agreement about needing something other than DocumentReference.</p>

<p>I would like to see ONE resource that is metadata for Binary and other external resources.  Essentially anything that uses Attachment datatype should be looked at closely. Not to say there should not be uses of Attachment, but rather to evaluate if there is specific scope and bright difference between general metadata of Binary. Is this possibly another 'pattern' we should have? <br>
As to name... we need a better name. How about we keep Media, and merge in DocumentReference, so that Media is what survives and DocumentReference goes away?</p>

<p>I'm fine with that notion.  Though "metadata for binary" would clearly exclude clinical notes as part of the scope - which means we'd need to find a more appropriate home.</p>

<p>reasonable... so what then is the clear definition of this thing that merges Media+DocumentReference? Do we also merge in Attachment? <br>
Are there others from this list that are really general (clearly many are clearly distinct)?<br>
    Attachment is used in the following places: RelatedArtifact, ProdCharacteristic, BodyStructure, Claim, ClaimResponse, Communication, CommunicationRequest, Consent, Contract, DiagnosticReport, DocumentReference, ExplanationOfBenefit, HealthcareService, Library, Media, Patient, Person, Practitioner, Questionnaire, QuestionnaireResponse, RelatedPerson, SubstanceNucleicAcid, SubstancePolymer, SubstanceProtein and SubstanceSpecification</p>

<p>Attachment is a data type.  There's lots of places where you'll want to have a binary where the relevant metadata is in the referencing resource.  My leaning would be BinaryMetadata - i.e. Extra/indexing information about a binary stored somewhere.</p>

<p>Re: BinaryMetadata... Is it good to emphasize the 'binary' aspect? binary can contain anything... many people think of binary as in non-text... I am not arguing that the Binary resource needs to be changed. I am just saying that applying that word again to the metadata may be overkill and cause wrong impressions. That said, it likely would be more understood than "DocumentReference". <br>
we could get very informal "Blob"<br>
or "Appendix", "Extra", "Supplement", "Adjunct", "Auxiliary", "Ancillary",</p>

<p>That is indeed a good use-case for DocumentReference. That DocumentReference and image could be used as evidence for an Observation. Most likely as derivedFrom, and would not likely be that the image itself that is considered an observation (valueAttachment). This seems the way you have described it. Right?</p>

<p>Pretty much, although I used the Media resource in the original proposal. I did have hard time choosing, though.</p>
