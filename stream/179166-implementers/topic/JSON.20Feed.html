<p>Yeah, that's like an RSS version of the DDP protocol we've been using for the past 4 or 5 years.  DDP was actually a websocket version of pubsubhubbub, which was directly inspired by RSS.  </p>
<p>It should work really well.  It's only unidirectional compared to DDP though, so changes on the client won't get propagated back to  the server unless an HTTP endpoint or RPC method is invoked.  But that generally works out really well.  JSON Feed out and HTTP call back actually makes for a very nice architecture, which is what many of our apps using DDP have drifted towards.  </p>
<p>My $0.02 is that it would be an excellent library to support, be widely used, and very popular to work with.</p>
