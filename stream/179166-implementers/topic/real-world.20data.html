<p>Is there any real-world FHIR JSON data that I can download from the Internet?</p>

<p>Yes, if you go to the FHIR specification pages, every page has an Examples tab, with examples in JSON for that particular resource.<br>
e.g. Patient examples:  <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/patient-examples.html">https://hl7.org/fhir/patient-examples.html</a></p>
<p>If you are looking for "complete FHIR datasets" that represent "real world" clinical data you probably want to look at Synthea:<br>

<p>Thanks for your help!<br>
I am still concerned that the synthea data will not be convincing enough to be used in the paper.</p>

<p>If you find 'real' FHIR data sitting on a server anywhere, that's an indication of a serious security violation.  Generally the only way to have access to 'real' data is to work within an organization that owns the data - and even then, it might go through a de-identification process first.  Healthcare data is sensitive.  It's not made publicly available.</p>

<p>you'd need a bunch of patients who were no longer living, and some good longitudinal data on them to get a real-world database. Maybe there's a foundation that would ask people to donate their data as part of a will? The synthea data offers the state of the art and has been used in a large number of publications. The appropriateness of the data depends on your use case.</p>

<p>No longer living doesn't necessarily mean the patients privacy rights are waived.  Patients can certainly elect to make their data publicly available or available for research - but it's likely that their data won't necessarily be representative as those willing to publicly share data are those least likely to have information in their records they consider 'sensitive'</p>

<p>Well...when they've been deceased for 50 years the rights change. However, your point on representation is accurate. Better to go with a synthetic data base that is 'statistically similar' to some large group of people.</p>

<p>Sure - but there tends to not be much discrete healthcare data on people who've been dead for 50+ years, let alone data exposed as FHIR :)</p>

<p>Also, even if it existed, the data wouldn't necessarily be relevant to training AIs, as so much has changed in terms of risks, testing approaches, meds, etc.</p>

<p>Indeed. You'd want an AI that was constantly learning as the system changed. And the AI itself, if widely providing input into clinical care, will alter the associations between action and data. It's quite a thing to attempt. If an AI is what you're working on, better to get a good collaboration.</p>

<p>unless you're 'simply' looking for the AI to find current associations to report, without an intervention, I suppose</p>

<p>That's an interesting article - at least the overview.  Yes, there are many variables in exactly how patient care was delivered, that's part of the reason for 'standards of care' and 'care guidelines' and metrics to check that those guidelines are being followed and actually improving care. (the PDCA loop).   I suspect though, at this point Synthea data is the best, freely available, de-identified patient datasets that you can find.  (As Lloyd points out, unless you are working with a provider who gives you access under HIPAA or other PHI protection rules.)</p>
