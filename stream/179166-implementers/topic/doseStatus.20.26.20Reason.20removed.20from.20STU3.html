<p>In STU3, resource Immunization contains vaccinationProtocol.doseStatus &amp; doseStatusReason, but these data elements have been removed from resource Immunization R4.  </p>
<p>A totally new resource immunizationEvaluation has been introduced in R4 which houses the doseStatus &amp; doseStatusReason.  <br>
However this new resource has a FMM of '0', my project has been using resourceImmunization with vaccinationProtocol.doseStatus &amp; doseStatusReason, and we intend to upgrade from FHIR STU3 to R4.  </p>
<p>Shall I bite the bullet and migrate the doseStatus &amp; Reason to the new resourceImmunizationEvaluation which has a FMM of '0'? or shall I introduce extension(s) to map them as a transition from STU3 to R4, pending for immunizationEvaluation to mature?  Please advise, thanks.</p>

<p>You'd generally be better off migrating them to the new resource.  (You can make it a contained resource if you don't have the notion of it as an independent instance.)  It was split out because the same immunization may be evaluated multiple times (possibly in different places).</p>
