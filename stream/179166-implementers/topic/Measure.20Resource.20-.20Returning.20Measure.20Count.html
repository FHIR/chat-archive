<p>Hi All - Looking to implement an API utilizing the Measure resource which returns an aggregate count of open risk gaps for a given member.  Has anyone done this in the past?  If so, which operation was used and in which fields can the aggregate count be returned in.. thanks in advance!</p>

<p>There is a $care-gaps operation that can be used to evaluate and return information on care gaps using quality measures as the mechanism for identifying the gap. The Data Exchange for Quality Measures IG has details: <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-deqm/gaps-in-care-reporting.html">https://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-deqm/gaps-in-care-reporting.html</a></p>

<p>If you wanted to aggregate care gaps for a patient, it would be straightforward to define a continuous-variable measure that counted gaps, as represented by DetectedIssue resources produced by the $care-gaps operation.</p>
