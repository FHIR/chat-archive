<p>Hi everyone!  I have an implementation question that I would love some feedback on.  I've noticed that several "FHIR touching" (for lack of a better term) specifications define some sort of JSON envelope with (sometimes) a FHIR resource inside (e.g., <a href="https://cds-hooks.org/examples/">CDS Hooks</a>, <a href="http://fhircast.org/events/imagingstudy-open/">FHIRcast</a>, and current projects like FAST).</p>
<p>How are people implementing this?</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, developers tend towards FHIR libraries which require custom serializers and parsers (e.g., HAPI, Firely, etc.).  Also as far as I can tell, those libraries do not allow for generic parsing and serializing of objects (e.g., protocol XYZ envelope object).</p>
<p>If people are not using FHIR libraries, <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/json.html">FHIR JSON</a> has some differences (small, but <code>important!</code>) from standard JSON... Are these differences being accounted for?</p>
<p>Any input would be appreciated, thanks!</p>
