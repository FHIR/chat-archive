<p>Let's say i want to GET /ServiceRequest. It references other many other resources (like patient, practitioner, etc...), so it's easy for the GETting system to go find those additional resources after the initial request. </p>
<p>However, how would the GETting system know that there is an /attachment resource connected to the /ServiceRequest? because the /Attachment references the /ServiceRequest, but the /ServiceRequest does not reference the /attachment?</p>

<p>in practice, servers need to maintain indexes that keep track of the reverse references.</p>

<p>I don't think that's really possible in this use case. I'll rephrase and try to clarify:<br>
(Note: I INCORRECTLY said /attachment resource, I meant to say /Appointment)</p>
<p>Let's say an eReferral application is holding a /ServiceRequest resource that was sent to it. There are other systems (such as the provider's EMR) that may want to do a lookup a /referralRequest on the eReferral system (lets assume for argument sake that subscriptions aren't implemented, and you cannot POST to the provider EMR). So, the provider EMR does:  </p>
<p>GET /serviceRequest/&lt;ID&gt;</p>
<p>Let's say that the eReferral system is managed by a central referral service, and that somebody there has added an /appointment resource, which references the /serviceRequest. How would the provider system that is doing the GET /serviceRequest know that there is a /Appointment resource too which references the /serviceRequest?</p>

<p>well, then, it wouldn't, it would have to know to ask somewhere</p>

<p>Ok, so then an "implementation guide" type of process to specify to look for /appointments, or possibly some kind of search extension on /serviceRequest might be the right approach?</p>

<p>I'm looking into the search &amp; revinclude functions now to figure this out... I think i can rephrase my request better now:</p>
<p>How to do a search such that</p>
<p>GET/serviceRequest/&lt;ID&gt;/?parameters...</p>
<p>Returns all of the resources that reference this resource?</p>

<p>I don't believe that we've defined a wildcard for _revinclude for doing this</p>
