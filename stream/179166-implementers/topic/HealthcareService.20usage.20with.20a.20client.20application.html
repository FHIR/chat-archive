<p>The HealthcareService spec specifically states the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HealthcareService resources do not represent Computer related Services (not SOA)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We would like to enable a client application to interact with FHIR that acts on behalf of a HealthareService at an Organization. Am I understanding correctly that this would not violate the above statement since the HealthcareService is not modelling the client application itself?</p>

<p>I am not sure I understand the question. What does it mean for "a client application to interact with FHIR"? It obtains data from a FHIR server? It updates data on a FHIR server? As for acting on behalf of a Healthcare service, is that through some type of authentication and authorization process?</p>

<p>Yes it would auth using OAuth2 client credentials grant to receive a token that includes a reference to the HealthcareService that it is acting on behalf of. It would be able to search and create specific resources that have an association with this HealthcareService.</p>

<p>Doesn't sound like anything you describe is in violation of the part you quoted...</p>
