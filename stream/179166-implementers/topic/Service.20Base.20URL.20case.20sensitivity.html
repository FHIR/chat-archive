<p>I have a question about the FHIR definition for Service Base URL (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#root">http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#root</a>), as it relates to the "/path" portion of the URL. From the spec:</p>
<hr>
<p>The Service Base URL is the address where all of the resources defined by this interface are found. The Service Base URL takes the form of</p>
<p>http{s}://server{/path}</p>
<hr>
<p>The spec goes on to say "All URLs (and ids that form part of the URL) defined by this specification are case sensitive".</p>
<p>For example, is FHIR saying that these two are NOT to be considered the the same thing?<br>
<a href="http://myserver:8080/mypath1/Patient/123">http://myserver:8080/mypath1/Patient/123</a><br>
<a href="http://myserver:8080/MYPATH1/Patient/123">http://myserver:8080/MYPATH1/Patient/123</a></p>
<p>I do not mean to argue one way or the other, just want to make sure I understand correctly.</p>

<p>yes you understand correctly. There's no rule that they can't refer to the same content, only that systems are not to assume that they do</p>
