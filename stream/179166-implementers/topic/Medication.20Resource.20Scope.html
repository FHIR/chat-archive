<p>Splitting off from the <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/COVID.20Immunization">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/COVID.20Immunization</a> thread so that one doesn't get hijacked by this tangent. <br>
It sounds like the Medication resource can be used both as a definition of a medication as well as a description of an instance of a medication. Is that right?</p>

<p>i would say partly true.  The scope of the Medication resource is to identify the medication that is being used in the referring resource.  This can be done by specifying a code and lot number and identifier (if you just wanted to send the code, you'd probably just send the code as most references are CodeableReference(Medication).  If you are defining a compound, you can also specify a set of ingredients and a recipe for making that compound.</p>
<p>The intent is <em>NOT</em> that you can say "this medication with this code has these ingredients".</p>

<p>When looking at an instance of a Medication resource is it possible to tell the difference between a definition of a medication and an instance of a medication? Or should you be telling by context (eg. a Medication referenced in a MedicationRequest is probably a definition because a provider probably isn't ordering a specific instance of the medication)? Does it really matter?</p>

<p>i just feel that the distinction between "definition" and "instance" is a non-starter when it comes to the Medication resource.  even historically it has always been problematic.  I think that the only time that the Medication resource is explicitly referring to a specific instance of a medication is when the Medication.identifier is specified, i.e. a serial number is given.  Every other time, even when the resource contains a recipe and a list of ingredients, it is not referring to an instance.</p>

<p>no, it is always an actual medication.  When a prescriber says "100mg of amoxicillin" he is prescribing an actual medication.  He just doesn't care which specific brand of amoxicillin is dispensed.</p>

<p>I agree with the suggestion/question earlier by Craig that it doesn't really matter if it's an instance or not.<br>
If its dispensed or administered, you know that there was one selected you could touch. Before that (requested) there isn't one specific one you can touch. But systems aren't going to be acting on some rather artificial "it's now an instance" flag. The context is clear from the use of the Medication resource.</p>

<p>The reality is that there's a continuum.  If you indicate that you dispense a medication with a particular lot number, that's not really an 'instance', in that you're not identifying the specific pill, but you're certainly conveying a degree of 'instancy' information.  (You could also have 10 different dispenses that all refer to the same Medication resource instance declaring that same lot number - and that wouldn't mean you dispensed the same pill 10 times, merely that they are all the same 'kind' of medication from the same lot.)</p>

<p>I've asked some of these questions before and specifically filed a GForge ticket in the past asking for there to be a Medication.idenfitfier (*) so that the "instance" can be differentiated from the "class" (or abstract type).    If you have a medication quality control system you'd need to at least track the lot in case there are problems with a particular lot though that is still not an 'instance'.   However, it is possible that a specific solution for a specific patient gets a bar code label and unique identifier that is 'one of a kind'.   Imagine if there was a problem with a specific solution that got 'contaminated' or was mixed incorrectly, it seems like the pharmacy control systems (and people) would want to track that specific instance of the drug given to a specific patient.   Also, when the clinician actually does the administration (RAS in V2, MedAdmin in FHIR) then at that point a unique instance of a drug is actually given.    I suppose with one pill from one lot (or bottle of pills) it might not make much of a difference but for other use cases it would.</p>
<p>I also think of the 5-Rights Med Admin with barcodes so that the clinician (and system) knows and documents that the exact, specific instance of a med is given the Right Drug, to the Right Patient at the Right Time, with the Right Dose, with the Right route.</p>
<p>(*) I was amazed back in STU3 that it seemed like the Medication resource was the only one that didn't have an identifier property (other than maybe some of the non-patient infrastructure/foundational type resources)</p>

<p>Is lot number always meant to be an identifier of multiple items of which this is one? If it was unique to this item - possible for a dispensed pack presumably - would it go in batch.lotNumber or identifier?</p>

<p>OK, but the adverse event could happen much later and then how would a system track down to the specific instances of medication administrations that were associated with this Adverse event?   Yes, sometimes it could be a 'bad batch/lot' but other times a specific 'mixed solution' (a true one-of).</p>
<p>For other use cases I've seen is that when interfacing to existing MAR/CPOE systems that still (only) support HL7 V2 there needs to be a way to match the RAS (RXA) identifier of the "instance" of the drug with what is used as an identifier in the MedicationAdministration resource for that traceability back to the originating system.</p>

<p>FHIR can record the medication that was administered. If a "mixed solution" has a useful identifier, it can be recorded using FHIR, and potentially referenced later. If not, it can't. But FHIR cannot fix limitations in real world processes. If you don't know what administration it was, then FHIR can't really help you.</p>

<p>I'm assuming you mean the "instance of the medication" given that Medication (the resource) can be anywhere on the continuum. I don't see this spelled out in the resource definition (only the comment of "The serial number could be included as an identifier."). Would you like a Jira ticket to clarify the use of .identifier, restricting it to ids for medication instances?</p>

<p>All identifiers are identifiers. We can't add one for each type across a continuum. No one would know which to use. It is already a problem with two of them. We want one type (identifier), which has a type, so you can say what it is if you need to.</p>

<p>To clarify and repeat my earlier statement, Medication.identifier should be used for a string that uniquely identifies a specific medication.

<p>no, it's not an opinion.  Take a look at Pharmacy's V3 models.  They modelled every element that could be exchanged so that there was a standard way.  That led to models that did not actually reflect what was being exchanged since no one had the use of every requirement and use case.    FHIR intentionally went the opposite way.  Here is the line from the spec:  "FHIR resources aim to define the information contents and structure for the core information set that is shared by most implementations. There is a built-in extension mechanism to cover the remaining content as needed."  So you might have a "standard element" that isn't shared by most implementations and thus isn't in FHIR.  Medication.identifier was one of those.  We agreed that a Medication serial number existed but the implementations that Pharmacy WG knew of and had participation from did not record nor exchange it.  So it wasn't originally in scope.  When the list of implementations grew, the need to exchange a serial number came forward and thus got included.</p>

<p>Anyway, that is not the issue, it's just that we take modeling-based decisions, and we take empirical decisions. Some of those are a hit, some are a miss. I would like to see a serial number on anything that is a product, but it's not something I cannot get around.</p>

The medication resource allows us to specify (not define) a specific instance or a kind of a medicine - whether there is a continuum or definition vs not... that doesn't matter I think.</p>

<p>In September 2017, you raised this issue.  We suggested that it be an extension for STU3 until more systems came forward with the requirement.  You raised the exact same issue in January 2018 and we decided to change it at that time.  In September 2018, we realized that a serial number could be considered an identifier and moved it.  That's how things should get added to the spec.</p>

<p>At the moment it's hard to know from the text that .identifier is for the (relatively rare) case of a <em>unique</em> number (serial number is mentioned, but only as a possibility), and .lotNumber is for the non-unique cases. But that is clear now, and the text could easily be improved.</p>
<p>I can also see an issue where you may not know (yet, or ever) if a number is a unique identifier or not. I assume the rationale was that {anyresource}.identifier is meant to be unique. Is that a rule? If so then it has to be the way it is. If that is not true then all unique or non-unique identifiers could have been modelled in one attribute, which is simpler in some ways.</p>

<p>Just an aside -- this discussion seems to have corollaries to the UDI identifier in Observations:  <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/device.html#udi">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/device.html#udi</a></p>
<p>"The UDI may identify an instance of a device uniquely (when the PI includes a serial number), or it may just identify the type of the device."</p>
<p>It's interesting that this use case was driven by a governmental requirement and also, that FHIR added a unique property to Observation for this rather than "overloading" the identifier property.</p>
<p>As in the case of medications though, this need for device-level (or 'instance level') traceability comes from the safety/quality control requirements around the medical practice, in this case device use, in the case of medications, medication use (or abuse).</p>

<p>I don't know if this is helpful... but it might be. In the supply chain world, there isn't a distinction between LOT NUMBER and SERIAL NUMBER. They are the same concept. A SERIAL NUMBER is just a LOT with one (and only one) member. I also note that we run the risk of conflating "active ingredient" with "product" (or so it seems from the thread). A clinical order for acetaminophen doesn't care what brand. But when this order is fulfilled (dispensed, or dispenses <strong>and</strong> administered), we need to track the exact product (what GTIN... which can also include the LOT# for lot-controlled products). This also can connect back to data elements maintained by our insurance colleagues... since there may well be a defined formulary for the various acetaminophen products that are included in the portfolio of insured/covered products.</p>

<p>I agree with Derek that these numbers might overlap. You can have a unique "lot number" I assume (at least in common language of the domain). And then that would not go in lotNumber but in identifier. <br>
The tricky issue is that given a number written on something (or a legacy record of a number), it may be hard to know if it is/was unique (like a serial number) or not (like a lot number). So you can't know where to put it.  "Uniqueness" doesn't seem to me to be a good filtering criteria.<br>
Is there a general FHIR requirement that resource.identifier uniquely identifies that thing?</p>

If it seems common to not know whether what is on the box is unique or not - as Derek says - it doesn't seem good to not have a clear place to put it.<br>

<p>Sure.  If something is a lot number, stick it in lot.  If it's a lot of one, so be it.  You only stick something in 'identifier' if it's truly known to be unique.  And most user interfaces will call it something like "serial number" which should hopefully avoid confusion.  (And in fact, most systems won't capture it at all because there aren't a lot of places that deal with dose-specific serial numbers.</p>

<p>unlike what Derek said, there does appear to be a natural distinction between a product's lot number and a product's serial number.  FDA, EMA, and Health Canada both make a distinction.  Here, as an example, is the FDA's discussion of a product identifier: Includes the product’s lot number, expiration date, national drug code (or NDC), and a serial number.<br>
I think that a more interesting conversation revolves around GTINs.  From my reading of the GTIN Allocation Rules document, it seems that you can assign a GTIN to a single unpacked pill, but that the pill wouldn't be marked with the GTIN via barcode.  The bottle that all of those pills comes in would be assigned a different GTIN.  What I couldn't clarify (and would love if someone else could) is if the GTIN assigned to the single unpacked pill was just an identifier of <em>any</em> single unpacked pill or whether it was a GTIN assigned to that specific single unpacked pill.  I would be surprised if a separate GTIN was assigned to every single pill but I don't know enough about the size of the GTIN space.  I did find reference to a sGTIN (a GTIN plus a serial number) but I couldn't find that in the specification.<br>
In any case, where do we think the GTIN should go?  Is it a Medication.identifier?  Is it actually just the Medication.code?  I've actually seen guidance from supply chain providers that basically equates the NDC with a GTIN.

<p>(not wishing to skip over GTIN discussion)<br>
Regarding lot vs serial,  these things are differentiated, and may be clearly defined, but I get the feeling that in practice you may not know which of the clear definitions you have in front of you. Official guidance doesn't always reflect what goes on in the ground, which is what we need to support.<br>
TBH I can't see a strong reason to split up the identifiers based on uniqueness.<br>
Putting them all in identifier seems reasonable, then only one place to worry about.<br>
But it seems it's just me who doesn't know what is unique and what is not :-)<br>
So I think the main thing would be to better document this "uniqueness" requirement, which seems fundamental, because I totally missed that when I came to use this recently. I will raise a Jira.</p>

<p>There is a very mature nomenclature in the supply chain domain related to part numbering, lot control, etc. The tracking of materials -- including lot controlled and serial number controlled items -- is not a requirement unique to healthcare. If we develop a nomenclature for <strong>our</strong> materials (like medications, for example) that is <em>not</em> compatible with the nomenclature used by GS1, we'll just be creating problems for ourselves... and perhaps (potentially) problems for patients and providers, too. This feels to me like an area where the physical-world use case needs to drive what our informatics model should do... especially including how we decide to use our resource identifier.</p>

<p>In supply chain management and industrial engineering, a part number (also called a stock keeping unit, or SKU) will need to be different each unique combination of form, fit or function. If the form, fit or function changes... then a new part number is created. Lot numbers (or serial numbers... for lots of 1) are for traceability. They do not impact the form, fit or function. An item's serial number is not used as a replacement for its part number.</p>

<p>It's interesting reading all of this discussion.   One thing that strikes me (probably from the V2 world) is the difference between an "unencoded order" where the clinician just says, "give the patient some amount of X", where X is the generic or even product drug name.   That is fine for unencoded orders (OMP or RXO segments in V2) but when the Pharmacy gets that order they create an "encoded order", which is typically more precise, that is, they specify the specific brand in stock, the particular package (drug form), and so forth (because of knowledge of what's in the Pharmacy and maybe also the patient's condition and side-effects/adverse reactions, etc.), that would end up in RGV (Give) messages in V2.   Then, when the specific instance of a drug is actually given, no matter whether or not it has a unique identifier on it, it is surely a unique instance of the drug being given (RAS in RXA/RXC in V2).    Of course V2 is more 'transactional' (in a sense) than FHIR which seems to only contain the 'current state' of something in the resource, in this case the Medication with respect to the encapsulating order (MedRequest) or administration (MedAdmin) and that seems to be part of the problem for this difference in how the Medication.identifier might be used over these different steps in the med workflow.</p>
<p>[I suppose at the 'unencoded order' stage it might be Medication.code only, but surely at the 'administration' stage it is unique and seems to need Medication.identifier.]</p>

<p>If you know an identifier for the medication you can record it. If you don't, but want to record "the unique instance of the drug <em>being given</em>" (my emphasis on the act of "being given", not the instance) then the associated activity resource, in the later stages of workflow, is unique and identifiable. MedicationDispense for "given to the patient" (as in "handed to"), or MedicationAdministration for the sense of "given to to take". Does that cover what you are thinking of John?</p>

<p>Also particular to supply chain --  I may have multiple SKUs that all contain the same thing. Drug X could be packaged in bottles of 50, 100 and 500. These are all the same drug and manufactured at the same time with the same LOT# and expiry date. As <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="298707">@John Silva</span>  has noted, a medication order for X could be equally fulfilled by dispensing any of these 3 SKUs... but at the time of dispense, it will be necessary to say which one. And so, at the time of dispense (or administration), the SKU and the LOT# will need to be recorded. It is likely an attribute of the SKU that its classification or its product family will be denoted as X. This is a challenge. The what it "is" from an active-ingredient standpoint is not identical to what it "is" from a stock management standpoint. Typically, the GS1 GDSN (Global Data Synchronization Network) database maps GTINs (SKUs) to ATC codes (active ingredients). That's how it is in Canada and in the US, too, I believe.</p>

<p>I do not understand the reasoning about the uniqueness vs non-uniqueness. A serial number has a meaning. It's meant to be unique and used and exchanged as such. A lot number is a different attribute with typically a different granularity. This is how all systems operate, do we want to consider deviating from that?</p>

<p>This is perhaps why something was telling me that using an "identifier" for serial number is not a good idea. It is a projection onto a model, without a need for that. It requires us to consider whether something is unique or not.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191651">@Rik Smithies</span>  - yes, MedDispense is 'equivalent' to the V2 RGV (Give) message and MedAdmin to the V2 RAS (Administration) message.  However, in the V2 workflow there are separate places in the message (segments) to capture the 'originally ordered' drug (e.g. ORC or RXO, and the specific drug "to be given" (RXG, with optional RXG.25 barcode id) and then the actual instance given (RXA and/or RXCs for bases and additives).   The question I have with the FHIR 'current state model' is that as the medication workflow transitions from one state to another, does the same Medication resource get used (i.e. instance stored in FHIR server) or is there a unique instance stored with (typically more) precise identification as it steps through the Med workflow?</p>

<p>You can say that an NDC code uniquely identifies a trade item and we put it in Medication.code.  If you are going to make the argument that you did, then I will gladly point people to put the GTIN in the Medication.code.</p>

<p>Jose -- your example should not happen... and if it did happen, it should throw a supply chain (GS1) exception. By definition -- no two items should have the same serial number. This is why, in my view, we're getting a bit arm-wavy when we talk about serial numbers on pharmaceutical items. To assign an individual serial # to every vial of vaccine coming off a production line just doesn't happen (in my experience, at least, when I was a supply chain advisor to Pharmacia and Upjohn). Pharmaceutical products are made in batch lot runs and it is essential to track the batch lot in case a recall is necessary. But there could be millions of doses produced out of the same batch lot production run. </p>
<p>I'm starting to see the wisdom, however, of tracking serial numbers and lot numbers as separate elements in our FHIR resources. In many ERP products, there is only one data field (true for ObviousMRP and for JDE, for example) and the definition of a serial number is that it is a lot with only one member in it. But by tracking separate elements, we can tell that a serial number should be globally unique for the same GTIN and (as mentioned above) throw an exception if we ever find that this isn't the case.</p>

<p>RE: re-using the same resource for two different purposes... I must admit my radar is going off, a bit. When the resource is fulfilling a master data management (MDM) purpose, then it is denoting a "thing" and we will be well-served to have the identifier somewhat following the "part number rule" -- if the form, fit or function changes, then we need a new identifier. But where the resource is associated with an event or transaction (e.g. MedicationDispense, or MedicationAdministration) then it makes more sense for the identifier to denote a unique transaction # or some similar event tracking ID. I'm sorry if I'm the only one who isn't following the plot... but it seems to me very unhelpful to conflate these two fundamentally different concepts.</p>

I think those are different concepts and indeed different resources (eventually also different resource types) would be best. <br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span>  I think it is interesting to note that a <strong>MedicationRequest</strong> for acetaminophen is not an order for a product (GTIN level)... it is an order for an active ingredient (ATC level). A <strong>MedicationDispense</strong>, however, will need to identify that it was Tylenol, and record the batch lot. It isn't clear to me what is expected of the <strong>Medication </strong>resource referenced by these two? It doesn't seem like it can be expected to be the <em>same</em> resource... can it?

<p>ATC is not a substance code, is a classification (it is not univocal). I'm aware that a request for acetaminophen is not a request for a specific GTIN. But you can have a medicationrequest for a specific GTIN. We are exploring this in depth for a few years (hence my reservations about some aspects of the current approach, but that is not the point here).</p>

<p>About the resources - I don't think the current Medication resource is incorrect here. It allows us to specify whatever attributes are needed to convey what is meant - with or without a brand name, or  with or without a lot number, depending on what you want to order or to register as dispensed. I actually favour a tighter integration between the master data and transactional resources - not because they are not separate concepts (they are and I try to underline that every chance I get) but because when specifying a product you need to use more than just a code.</p>

<p>Derek, from what Jean was saying you would not necessarily have Medication resources sitting around for all those types waiting to be used in requests or dispenses. It didn't sound like Medication is intended for that sort of definition, and to be re-used over and over. You would at least have to clone them into an 'instance' Medication for each use. I think the idea is that you make one new for each event, and the definition is really only in the code (backed by NDC, SNOMED etc, possibly GTN, or even ATC). <br>
Medication definitions can also be done in MedicinalProductDefintion, which could be pointed by the Medication (in lieu of a code), but that relationship doesn't exist at the moment (we have asked for it, but it was not allowed).<br>
Also to your point about ATC, drugs are not always prescribed by substance/active moiety. That is routine in hospitals, but in primary care (General Practice, family doctor) it is more common to prescribe at generic (or 'virtual') product level, with an actual product in mind but just not a specific manufacturer. Virtual product, actual product and substance based requests are all required, and all covered, I believe. This is the continuum of "specificity" that has been mentioned earlier in the thread.<br>
I don't think that "ATC is not a code". If that degree of specificity is good enough for the context of the request, I see no reason why you can't request that and have a qualified dispenser turn that into an appropriate actual product. It's common to have lists of moieties to pick from (e.g. UK VTM, virtual therapeutic moiety, which is similar in concept to ATC, just more integrated with the product list).</p>

<p>~ a VTM identifies one moiety so it is a product code.<br>
That's not correct, by what I consider the normal definition of a product.<br>
Many products can share the same moiety (and so VTM, at least in the systems that I'm aware of), including many virtual products - for instance solid and liquid forms. <br>
A VTM is a moeity/substance code, not a product code.<br>
The fact that a moiety can be in more than one part of ATC, doesn't mean than an ATC code (which is made more specific by moeities being non-unique, not less) cannot express the desired concept of the request. But we have already established that there are better moiety level code systems for prescribing.</p>

<p>There is no need for a Medication resource to exist in abstract, that is then referenced later on when activity happens. The integrity is to the definition of the medication, which is the code. The medication definition concepts are in the terminology. <br>
If a resource is needed for a definition, then that would be to a MedicinalProductDefinition. MedicationKnowledge is not intended for that I believe, but for extra information <em>about</em> the medication. e.g. for decision support.</p>

<p>ok well that is wider than this prescribing pattern we are discussing. <br>
You would need to look for a MedicationRequest for a Medication that included the medicine you were interested in. (or a dispense or administration possibly). The complication is that you may need to transform from product to moiety. <br>
That is just a general problem with guidelines however, not a consequence of this FHIR representation. The GP system I did in 1995 had this same issue with our decision support guidelines. <br>
You need a terminology that allows you to ask for "paracetamol" and find all the products (branded and unbranded), all the packs, forms etc and any substance based scripts (we didn't have that last issue in primary care however). This problem will be familiar to anyone making guidelines I think.</p>

<p>we're working with WHO and trying to develop <strong>computable </strong>care guidelines (CCGs) that can be leveraged to operationalize WHO's care guidelines for ANC or HIV and so on. as you would imagine... there are no "brands" referred to in WHO's guidelines. (hence my reference to ATC codes... since that seems to be about the level of the recommendations... i.e. for active ingredients). i've also been taking a cue from what's defined in the IPS regarding their profile of <strong>Medication (IPS)</strong> (which mandates either ATC or SNOMED in  medication.code).</p>

<p>If your guidelines don't know about brands, but your prescriptions do (most won't in fact, but a few may), then you would need a way to map brands to generics. That is common in drug terminologies. <br>
Also if your guidelines know about substances (in ATC) but your prescriptions don't (as in primary care) or do (secondary care) but its not coded in ATC, then you need maps there too. You need product to moiety/substance maps, and ATC to whatever substance codes are used maps. Again, medications terminology commonly does both of those. You can also represent that in MedicinalProductDefinitions if you want.</p>

<p>Medication is going to be used in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>most commonly as a 'contained' resource where a MedicationRequest, MedicationDispense, etc. needs to convey details about a particular medication beyond just the code (ingredients, lot number, whatever)</li>
<li>as a resource serving as some sort of 'formulary' entry representing medications available for ordering, dispensing, administering.  Typically these won't have lot number/expiry date/identifier information on them, though they could.  The registry indicates what's (typically?) allowed to be ordered/dispensed/administered.</li>
<li>as a resource serving in some sort of inventory management system, typically only referenced by MedicationDispense and MedicationAdministration that refers to what's actually on hand and available.  The dispensing system might also 'generate' identified Medication instances when it spits out unit-dose containers for transport to the ward, and eventually to the patient room</li>

<p>For the first two uses, you'll have hundreds or thousands of MedicationRequest/Dispense/Administration instances (for a wide variety of patients) all referring to the same Medication instances.  For the last, you'll have fewer, though if the instance is only specific to the level of 'lot', you could still have many resources referring to the same instance (because the instance doesn't represent a single pill, it instead represents "a pill from one of the bottles that arrived in shipment A").</p>

  BP med is not already prescribed<br>

If there isn't a clear way to tell what the <strong>medication </strong>resource for this BP med is, then there isn't a clear way to tell whether a medicationrequest for this med already exists. Also -- I appreciate that there may be vendor products that figure all of this out -- but if I can't make it work <strong>without</strong> these products, then I will need to know to mandate them for the MOHs in low  and middle income countries (LMIC) where I'm providing advisory services.

<p>Lloyd, why would your first bullet mean "you'll have hundreds or thousands ... all referring to the same Medication instances". <br>
If contained, they cannot be the <em>same</em> medication instance? Would all your thousands be for your second bullet?<br>
Also, Jean seemed to be saying that Medication was not expected to be a purely definitional thing (a list of medications to be referred to), and the definitional aspect was only a "less-to-more specified" thing. That sounded like the formulary use was not in scope (despite what I had thought before). <br>
Perhaps that was only referring to definitions within the "instance" use (request, to dispense) and not the "pure definition" use (formulary).</p>

<p>Derek, why would having a GTIN in the code would be limiting for CDS? As long as you can know things about the GTIN and its relation to other products, substances etc, you can reason about what things people are taking. It makes no difference what sort of code it is.</p>

<p>The GDSN in Canada, as I understand it, maps GTINs to ATC codes. So each CDS rule would go thru the drug terminology mapper to see if the rule should fire TRUE or not. Like that?</p>

<p>The WHO's ANC guidelines recommendation C.5 states:<br>
–– If a pregnant woman has not previously been vaccinated, or if her immunization status is unknown,<br>
she should receive two doses of a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine (TT-CV) one month apart with<br>
the second dose given at least two weeks before delivery. Two doses protect against tetanus infection<br>
for 1–3 years in most people. A third dose is recommended six months after the second dose, which<br>
should extend protection to at least five years.<br>
–– Two further doses for women who are first vaccinated against tetanus during pregnancy should be<br>
given after the third dose, in the two subsequent years or during two subsequent pregnancies.<br>
–– If a woman has had 1–4 doses of a TT-CV in the past, she should receive one dose of a TT-CV during<br>
each subsequent pregnancy to a total of five doses (five doses protects throughout the childbearing<br>
years).<br>
It would be useful to be able to have a <strong>medication order</strong> for this recommendation be completely consistent across <strong>all</strong> practitioners. And it would be equally useful if a woman's IPS <strong>medication statement</strong> were consistently expressed, too... so that the guideline could be readily evaluated and operationalized regarding subsequent administrations. That's the kind of thing I'm trying to accomplish. I think in some of these environments the re-engineering opportunity is there to improve the consistency (and quality) of how care is delivered. And if yes... how might we want to model the use of the medication, medicationrequest, medicationdispense and medicationadministration resources (and of course, the medication statement that is returned in the IPS).</p>

<p>In LMICs, my guess is there often wouldn't be a formulary function of what's allowed to be prescribed/available to be dispensed.  So in most cases, you'd probably be working with contained drugs.  As for what codes get captured, that tends to be national.  If there is no national terminology, then you'd probably be looking at using something like SNOMED (provided the country qualifies for a free license) and would need to look for mappings to the GTINs on the prescribing/administering side.</p>

<p>We need to be clear that the IPS medication profile does not <strong>mandate</strong> the use of ATC or SNOMED CT for medication coding.  It does <strong>highlight</strong> the visibility of those two particular code systems, as they have potentially wide (although not universal in the case of SNOMED CT) availability and applicability.  This is done be by representing them as separate slices.  Each <strong>slice</strong> has a required binding to its particular code system (maybe that's where the confusion arises?), but the slicing itself is open - so IPS doesn't have any mandate for this and allows for <strong>any</strong> medication terminology to be used.  We would have liked to be able to be more prescriptive and push (or nudge) toward a recommendation for something that could approach global usability, but we didn't come up with a suitable way to do that at the present time.  We did consider at some length specifying IDMP (at various levels) here, but ultimately we backed away from that as the needed content for it to be useful at a prescribable or describable level doesn't yet exist.</p>

<p>That's a very good question, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193307">@Derek Ritz</span>.  Unfortunately, I don't think that the GPS will be of any help with this.  We didn't include medications in our submission for the IPS free set (one of the contributing sets for the GPS), and I don't think that anyone else has, either, so I don't believe that there is any medication content at all in the current GPS.  The problem with that idea is that there isn't really a way that know of to come up with a useful subset of the "most common" medications, or something like that.  To make it useful, especially for e-prescribing, you pretty much would need to have a code available for whatever medication any patient could be taking - and that's completely out of the scope of the current GPS idea.  That will only begin to have a chance to work if at some point SNOMED Int. decides to make <strong>all</strong> SNOMED CT descriptions available for free use - but even then if the relationships aren't free then that will seriously hamper the use for CDS that was being discussed earlier.  Looking otherwise at ATC, I don't know how far we might be able to get with that.  It's been pointed out in this discussion that ATC is a classification.  In my mind that doesn't necessarily mean in any way that it isn't potentially useful, including for the IPS.  But I suspect that its granularity isn't sufficient for e-prescribing, unfortunately - though I wouldn't entirely rule that out.  Since it can at least generally provide the generic drug names that are needed, maybe with sufficient additional support for the other prescription elements there could be a way to make that work?  I don't know.  So I still don't know what the answer is for this, but I'm very interested in continuing to help all of us work to figure out some solutions.</p>
