<p><a href="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=12749" target="_blank" title="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=12749">GF#12749</a> proposes adding extensions to ContactPoint that would allow capturing country code, area code, local number and extension as separate components, similar to the way that Address can be expressed as both a full string as well as distinct parts.  This request was initiated based on a query from a tutorial rather than implementer request.  Before evaluating it, we'd like to know if implementers are already doing this or if they'd be likely to use the extensions if they were defined.</p>

<p>Our EHR does differentiate between the phone number and extension.  Within another platform, which doesn't have FHIR implemented yet, we have country code, phone number, and extension.  Neither platform breaks out area code.</p>

<p>I think standard extensions would be helpful. In some of our projects, we work with legacy systems, which have fields in their databases for different parts of the number: country code, area code, etc. It's not a problem to concatenate these fields outbound, but it's a pain to parse FHIR phone numbers when we have to feed data to these systems or if we need to support search by phone numbers.</p>

<p>I read that as a "pain in the parse" ;)</p>
