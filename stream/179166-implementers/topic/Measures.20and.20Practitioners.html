<p>If anyone can help me with understanding how Measure Report and Practitioner are connected. If I correctly understand Measure Calculation is performed for some Practitioner, but Measure Report does not have any link to Practitioner. This means that Measure Report exists by himself separately alone. This is unclear and I'm not sure how to implement this based on FHIR.</p>

<p>Measure calculation can be performed for a specific practitioner (there is a practitioner parameter to the $evaluate-measure operation), but it could also be performed for other granularities from a single patient up through an entire population. In the case that a measure is evaluated for all the patients for a single practitioner, it would make sense for the practitioner to appear on the MeasureReport, but so far we've only needed reportingOrganization. I'd be happy to see a tracker to add practitioner though.</p>
