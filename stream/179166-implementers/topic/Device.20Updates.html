<p>A discussion is in progress based on <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-26424">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-26424</a> that is yielding a proposal to:</p>
<p>Remove .specialization, remove .capability, remove .physicalCharacteristics from Device and DeviceDefinition (where they exist).<br>
Update Device.property to be as follows to encompass the attributes that are to be removed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the .property definition to reflect the different types that are being collapsed into this (specialization, capability, physical characteristics) and include suitable examples.</li>
<li>Update the backbone element content to be:<br>
     .property.type 1..1 CodeableConcept<br>
     .value[x]  0..* <br>
                  valueQuantity - Quantity<br>
                  valueCodeableConcept - CodeableConcept<br>
                  valueString - string<br>
                  valueBoolean - boolean<br>
                  valueAttachment - Attachment<br>
     .description 0..* string</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that Device.type already has been updated to be 0..*.<br>
This update would be applied to DeviceDefinition as well, except that the value[x] would not be as extensively defined, if not removed as this is not fully/at all (to be determined) for a definition.</p>

<p>Do we have an understanding of why those elements were added in the first place?  IS the .property to be sliced?</p>

<p>The .property element could be sliced in implementation guides where of interest.<br>
The others were added as aspects of interest and felt to be different enough, but the more we are looking at them, the examples actually overlap.</p>
