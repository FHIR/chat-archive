<p>Currently at the early design phase of a new major version of an API. Previous version used a custom operation to return bundles of multiple resource types in order to ensure that the response "maintained all necessary internal context".</p>
<p>The design principle was a bit like "its only safe to sent everything in one go".</p>
<p>So for example, a request to retrieve a list of immunisations, the response bundle has<br>
1) Patient resource<br>
2) Organization resource (patient's gp practice)<br>
3) Practitioner (Patient's usual gp )<br>
4) PractionerRole (Patient's usual gp role)<br>
5) List  of Immunization resources<br>
6) List of Condition resources (Problem Header) associated with the immunization event</p>
<p>It seems to me that a searchset of Imms resources would be safe to consume.</p>

<p>What if the consumer didn't need/want the patient/Organization(s)/Practitioner(s)/PractitionerRole(s) with their list of immunizations?<br>
What if the consumer has authorization to retrieve every immunization, does that mean their bundle includes every patient, every org, every prac, every PR as well?<br>
What if the immunization was provided by a practitioner/org that isn't the GP (say a pharmacy)?<br>
Wouldn't it be better for the server to just return what was asked for (Immunizations) and let the consumer dictate what they want additionally (if anything)?</p>

<p>Maintaining context in REST is generally achieved by passing the references.  If you've got a pointer to the patient and are able to retrieve it if/when you want it, then you have the context.  Having the context is distinct from having all of the data.</p>

<p>Ahhhh.... just twigged which api you are referring to. </p>
<p>I don't understand why all those resources are sent in one go. <br>
I would like to understand where that requirement has come from, I don't think it's the suppliers or consumers.</p>

<p>I think this is a misunderstanding on how a FHIR Resource+REST API works on a technical level.</p>
<p>The logical model consists of all those resources and this extra resources represent the <strong>provenance</strong> of the focused resource e.g. Immunization. <br>
It is provenance not clinical safety.</p>
<p>It is a well accepted pattern these resources can be referenced by well known codes/identifiers. With REST we can now add in resource references. Either pattern is fine. <br>
<strong>As long as these resources can be retrieved (easily),</strong> then you have no technical reason for including them in the query and this is a clinically accepted pattern which has been implemented in all commonly used HL7 interfaces in the NHS.<br>
Any consumer can retrieve the provenance if they need to.</p>
