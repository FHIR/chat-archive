<p>What kind of reports and when does a payer need to submit to CMS for interoperability ?  Will this be part of annual quality reporting  ?</p>

<p>As far as I am aware, the CMS Interoperability Final Rule does not have any  Payer reporting requirements.  The proposed reducing burden rule required specific reporting on the patient access API and Prior Authorization.  Since this proposed rule was not published in the Federal Register, the reporting requirements are not currently part of regulation.</p>

<p>Thanks Robert, good to know.  I'm also thinking ONC Filnal Rule Policies on information blocking, where there are criteria outlined for exception reporting on interfere with the access, exchange, or use of EHI.</p>

<p>One of the information blocking provisions talk about : 45 CFR part 171: Information Blocking: General Provisions; Exceptions that involve not fulfilling requests to access, exchange or use electronic health information; and exceptions that involve procedures for fulfilling requests to access, exchange or use electronic health information.   Any guidance on this from a payer perspective would help.</p>
