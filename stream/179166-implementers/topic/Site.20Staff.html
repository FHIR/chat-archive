<p>In clinical research, Research Sites have a number of different "staff" members associated with a site each one with a distinct role.  A staff member may be an instance or a kind.  To keep the individual (or group) associated with the role CareTeam is quite a nice fit, except we wouldn't be using it in relation to care of a patient.  Is there something better I should use or do we stretch CareTeam?</p>

<p>I'd be in favor of stretching CareTeam a bit.  It'll lessen the temptation to use Group.  It might still be possible to sneak in some definition changes that explicitly allow for the use.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191403">@Michelle (Moseman) Miller</span> - thoughts from the PC perspective?</p>

<p>That sounds like CareTeam for sure.<br>
I know of some using it for functional teams in the hospital, such as an emergency response team.</p>

<p>I do think our CareTeam introduction section needs to be refined.  CareTeam.subject (patient) is not required and the CareTeam.category can be "event" (which was defined as non-patient specific).  Thus, anything in the intro that implies there must be a patient is inconsistent with the structure that follows.</p>
