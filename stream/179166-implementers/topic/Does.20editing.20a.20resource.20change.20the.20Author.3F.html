<p>Tried searching but couldn't find anything useful, but please point me to an old thread if this has been discussed before. </p>
<p><strong>Use case</strong>: Patient enters some sparse info about something, a resource is created and then a Practioner adds more info. Who is then the Author?</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Say the Patient fills in some info in an AllergyIntolerance. We create a FHIR Resource for this with AllergyIntolerance.recorder = Patient. Now a Practioner adds more information to this resource and a new version is created. Who is then the author/recorder? The cardinatlity is 0...1, so we can't have multiple authors. Do we change the recorder to be the Practioner and if one wants the history of this object, one needs to look at previous version? Or do you create a brand new resource and point to the old one using Provenance?</p>

<p>There's no formal rule - it's driven by business practice.  If someone changes a prescription to be 'on hold', that wouldn't generally change the author.  If someone revamps a Condition to change the onset date and severity, that might change the author.  Also, you need to look at the definition of the element.  Some are clearly linked to 'original' author, others not.</p>
