<p>Are you located in the EU, or does your application use/process data from EU citizens? Then the GDPR (General data protection Regulation) legislation is likely to impact your application, see <a href="http://www.ringholm.com/column/GDPR_impact_on%20healthcare_data_interoperability.htm" target="_blank" title="http://www.ringholm.com/column/GDPR_impact_on%20healthcare_data_interoperability.htm">http://www.ringholm.com/column/GDPR_impact_on%20healthcare_data_interoperability.htm</a> for (initial) analysis.<br>
If you are like me (dismissive of such laws: who cares about such legislation, it's mostly procedural/organisational) - this will have an impact at the coalface and on the use of interoperability standards such as FHIR.</p>

<p>I'm not yet aware of any direct impact on FHIR itself. It does mean that you mean to by more careful around provenance, auditing, and your policy (and adherence)</p>

<p>We also designed Consent with these rules in mind. Hence why we included a place to record the actual text the patient saw and agreed to, so that it can be shown that it was crafted such that it would be understood by that patient.   Yes, Provenance and Auditing are always important . </p>

<p>The unique view Rene has captured is the requirement to provide to the subject any data about the subject ... in a standardized form... that is useful... hence "Interoperability Standards" (PDF likely not good enough).    As with the human-language-comprehension requirement, this Interoperability Standards requirement is the right thing for the goal of Privacy (which is more than confidentiality  <a href="http://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2015/04/privacy-principles.html" target="_blank" title="http://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2015/04/privacy-principles.html">http://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2015/04/privacy-principles.html</a> ). But these requirements are hard to achieve, especially for small organizations. Ewout pointed this out at the Madrid meeting.</p>

<p>The post is more of a wake up call: if your application is involved in any data processing scenario which requires a patient consent, then under the GDPR you SHALL have an API by May 2018 which allows the patient to pull all of the data out of the application in a structured fashion.<br>
That's a challenge above and beyond the more general requirement of taking better care of general privacy and security issues.</p>

<p>You're wrong - this requirement spans all paradigms. In REST, labels need to be present as part of the matadata of all resources, and Provenance (&amp;Consent) resources much be both created on the server and they must by queryable. Same for AuditEvents. <br>
In a bundle (e.g. of type message) one would include the Provenance &amp; Consent resources. If the bundle were in to be in response to a $gimme-GDPR-everything operation, it would also include all AuditEvent resources.<br>
The impact of GDPR may be wider than that, that section is just an initial analysis.</p>

<p>I would be very happy to find a set of people interested in testing security-labels, Provenance, AuditEvent, and Consent. Mike Davis has sent Duane to the last 5-6 connectathons only to find no one ready to address this level of Access Control or Audit Logging...  He has great materials on how he has implemented it. </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191372">@René Spronk</span> I was commenting with an engineering hat on. It will take far longer for messaging systems to adapt, if it is built into EU FHIR it's a big plus for adoption. Is it worth having an EU stream for these topics?

<p>I'm aware some of the US HIPAA consultants have been working on extending HL7v2 and HL7 v3 (CDA) to include Consent and other bits that would also be needed for the GDPR. We may wish to look into that. <br>
We could try and arrange a stream, but we'll have to see how we can raise awareness about this issue first - if we don't get sufficient interest in the issue any initiatives will be dead in the water. Usually there's not that much which binds the various EU Affiliates, not the various EU Vendors, so an EU Argonaut type initiative will be very hard to organise. We should probably go for generic guidance around the use of certain resources, and test that at a FHIR connectathon.</p>

<p>yes. I just read what you wrote. Some of the legislation is astonishing, actually. Outright fantasy. I'm guessing that the EU or national governments haven't actually allocated money to cover their own costs in meeting the law, let alone any one else's costs - only to mandate that you can't recover them. As for investing in the infrastructure that they assume exists... </p>

<p>The May2018 deadline will never be met in healthcare - we all know that. I don't know about the specifics of all EU governments, but certainly the Dutch governoment doesn't seem to be aware of the consequences of this requirement. <br>

<p>I am not convinced that this changes the Privacy Consent landscape, yes it makes it more prominent.  I need to point out that just because Consent is necessary, does not mean it must be gathered and/or communicated in an standard form. Consent is authorization for you to disclose the data you have to specific others. The result of you capturing consent rules is that YOU enforce those rules. Everyone else simply asks for the data they want and either get it or are denied.  There are very few use-cases where one party captures the Consent (rules) and another party is asked to enforce those rules...   This is why there is little interest in standardized consent, it is unnecessary to be standardized. So it might feel like we must do something about Consent, but reality is that consent is a local problem. This is even true of solutions like HEART (using UMA OAuth), the capturing of consent and enforcing of that consent are proprietary within the AuthZ actor. The only other consent standard is the 'Consent Receipt', which captures what was signed in non-coded form so-that the subject has a copy.   Even when a HIE choose to have a central consent management, it is responsible for capturing and enforcing (not using HEART, but very HEART like).  </p>

<p>that's not my understanding of heart. It's certainly true about smart on FHIR, where the contract between the auth server and the resource server is private, and the app requests are just indicative. </p>

<p>OTOH, in UMA/Heart, there's a standard contract between the AS and RS, and so they must agree about the impact consent. That's not quite the same as exchanging consent, but it's more than what you said</p>

<p>In the case of HEART, one needs to describe how one asks for an authorization token in such granularity that it can get approved or denied. So very much like generic OAuth. It is all about defining how to use 'scope' to express a boundary of what you want, what access you have been granted. This is no less hard than defining a Consent, in some cases it is much harder. But it is real-time authorization decisions, not one-time consent capture.</p>

<p>The man difference with HEART is that one separates the authorization decision responsibility. Otherwise spoken of as 'cascaded oAuth', where one cascades decisions. Two (for example) decisions that both must result in a PERMIT decision. The HEART authority is responsible for Privacy decisions, there is another that is responsible for Security (organizational) decisions.</p>

<p>In GDPR the right to 'data protability' applies to all data controllers and data processors involved.  It that sense it's 'contageous'. If as a healthcare provider A I have captured consent 1 to share data within an XDS affinity domain in the form of a PDF, and that PDF is consumed by provider B, I as the patient could go to either the XDS affinity domain, A, or B, to get hold of my data. Being in the know I'd go to  A, because they could probably give me the data in a better format than a PDF. <br>
That's why my blog talks about "downstream consequences". Note that there are (according to the GDPR) also legal grounds for sharing data within an XDS affinity domain. So at the very least there must be a set of privacy labels  to distinguish  between the reasons for sharing (consent based, or legal ground). If consents are purely local they act a bot like Provenance to back up the security label. If consents are wider in scope (in a national consent registry, Austria has this, some other countries are planning for it) it actually has a wider value (although receivers could just go to the national registry and see what consents have been given by a patient). Value for including Consent (to me): it is the consent the author of the information "thought to be applicable" - whether they applied the consent correctly or wrongly, we need to know what ground they thought they had for sharing the data (but that info could also be part of the AuditTrail). </p>

<p>Rene, Yes an audit is a technical backing of that kind of a report. One would not give direct (Raw) access to the audit, but one would create access reports given the data in the log. The AuditEvent can capture what was exported, to whom, when, where, and why... An audit reporting tool would search and filter these into a report. This report might be on-demand, monthly, daily, or in-real-time. This report might be delivered by many different means. This report is itself, PII...

<p>--- Another solution is the Kantara 'consent receipt', like a cash-register-receipt this is a blob that is dispensed when data is disclosed. this consent-receipt is, in theory, sent to the subject and expresses what data was released and under what authorization it was released.  -- This  combined with my prior message is simply a container for that access report.</p>

<p>Note the access report can also leverage the FHIR AuitEvent resource schema to hold the details in computable form... wrapped in a Composition so that there is a nice viewable narrative followed by the computable form.  I have mocked this up in my head and in PPT; but failed to get it more detailed than that.... Would love to have someone actually put that together... Would make a nice Implementation Guide...Oh to have infinite time</p>

<p>Regarding export of data in a standardized form ... take that with a grain of salt. It might as well be a CSV file ... that is a broadly accepted standard - and so is PDF. While FHIR may seem as a good alternative, GDPR has no intention of bruteforcing FHIR into the field 'just' to be able to export data to the individual.</p>

<p>To qoute the official EU guidance on data portability: "Data controllers should provide as many metadata with the data as possible at the best<br>
possible level of granularity, which preserves the precise meaning of exchanged<br>
information. As an example, providing an individual with .pdf versions of an email inbox<br>
would not be sufficiently structured. E-mail data must be provided in a format which<br>
preserves all the meta-data, to allow the effective re-use of the data. As such, when selecting a<br>
data format in which to provide the personal data, the data controller should consider how this<br>
format would impact or hinder the individual’s right to re-use the data. In cases where a data<br>
controller is able to provide choices to the data subject regarding the preferred format of the<br>
personal data a clear explanation of the impact of the choice should be provided. However,<br>
processing additional meta-data on the only assumption that they might be needed or wanted<br>
to answer a data portability request poses no legitimate ground for such processing."

<p>So yes, one could use a CSV format to dump ones database records, but you'd have to enrich them with metadata in such a way that it would be fairly easy for a patient to re-use the data and upload it somewhere else. The legislation is meant to support "portability", not simply "access" .</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191427">@Jens Villadsen</span> Recital 73 will (IMHO) only be an escape if there's additional danish legislation which adds additional scenarios for data processing that don't require patient consent (remember: any scenario which needs consent, then the data will be subject to data portability rights). <br>
Recital 73 limits the scope of how the EU, or its member states, could define additional "legal reasons" for processing data without explicit patient consent. In and of itself Recital 73 doesn't offer a "way out" of the GDPR requirements, unless one can point to more specific legislation by the EU or members states.</p>

<p>The usual measurement is level of effort. If one is communicating CDA documents with others, then it will be expected that one communicates CDA with the patient. Right? If all your EHR can communicate is CVS, then wouldn't that be considered in GDPR as the best you can do? What level of effort is expected of organizations to 'modernize'? I presume there is an expectation that one keeps up with their peers, so the market analysis showing that most peers are using CDA and XDS, would be hard evidence. right?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191380">@Elliot Silver</span> The whole point is "portability", not "access". I should be able to download my data from provider #1 and upload them to provider #2, regardless of whether we're talking about my social-media-posts,  my audio-playlist, or my healthcare-data. GDPR applies to all those use cases in the same fashion. <br>
GDPR isn't healthcare specific, its scope is all encompassing. It does contain a few healthcare specific requirements, but other than that one of the difficulties is interpreting a piece of general legislation and how that would impact healthcare IT.<br>
For simple "access" PDF would probably be more useful, and the GDPR does allow it.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> I agree that given the way it's specified in the GDPR it would be rather difficult to defend ones decision to provide a CSV to the patient if at the same tome one already supports one or more common interoperability standard (e.g. CDA, FHIR, v2, DICOM) for other purposes. <br>
Fines for non-compliance with the GDPR range up to 4% of the organisational revenue, also for healthcare provider organisations. However, quite a few contracts between healthcare providers and software development companies state that the software development company should add support for newly legislated requirements at no or low cost -  if they don't, they may end up paying the fine. I'd say there's plenty of motivation for software development companies to get cracking on this thing.</p>

<p>It's a good analysis, although its second part (parties will try and hide behind any of the legal reasons for data usage/exchange, to avoid having to deal with consents and the portability right) is hardly a new issue. The authors assume data controllers will be able to get away with this, I'm personally less worried because that would circumvent one of the core aspects of the GDPR. <br>
The first part of the article is absed on <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/european-commission-experts-uneasy-over-wp29-data-portability-interpretation/" target="_blank" title="https://iapp.org/news/a/european-commission-experts-uneasy-over-wp29-data-portability-interpretation/">https://iapp.org/news/a/european-commission-experts-uneasy-over-wp29-data-portability-interpretation/</a> - the interpretation of "data provided by the patient". Is that the same as "data observed on the patient" or not? If I have an X-Ray taken, will that be considered as "data knowingly provided by me (as a patient) to a healthcare provider"? <br>
If I listen frequently to a particular piece of music, is that observation by the app (which maintains a list of my favorites) part of the data portability right, or will it just be the play list itself (which was certainly provided by me) ? <br>
Anyway, good to see that there is discussion around this, and as the article notes we may have to wait until a case is brought in court to get some further guidance as to how it should be interpreted in the healthcare context.</p>

<p>Jose, yes there are other ways to have the authority to collect, process, or disclose... However what I am interested in is improving the FHIR Consent resource to support those cases where a Consent is needed or useful. Sometimes a consent is gathered because it is the right-thing-to-do; and not just because it is compelled by law/regulation.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> From a FHIr perspective we'll need to capture two things: if the lawful ground for processing/exchange (under the GDPR) is Consent, then we'll need to capture that consent and associate it with the appropriate resources; if the processing/exchange is being done on another lawful ground then we'll need to identify which specific legal ground (<a href="https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/6.htm" target="_blank" title="https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/6.htm">https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/6.htm</a> see 6.1) we have for using the data, and associate that with the FHIR resources in question.<br>
The first part clearly maps to the FHIR Consent resource. <br>
The second part (capturing the legal ground) is a bit more tricky, it has more aspects related to auditing than it has to provenance. Security tagging probably doesn't play a large role in this, given that a FHIR resource could be used by different parties who all have their own/different lawful reason for the processing. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span>  ?</p>

<p>I don't know our full picture, so i am picking on a few things that draw my attention, possibly echoing recent discussions on the subject. For example, the association between consent(/others) and the FHIR resources. I believe that is an indirect relation:<br>
The Consent (or others) is not associated with the resources, but with the processing of the resources. The resources usually represent the data, not the processing of the data.</p>

<p>in other words, GDPR does not care if for you need consent for a surgery. GDPR cares that if during that surgery you need to check the patient's name or age, then you have registered somewhere in a registry something like "when our patients undergo surgery, we need to take their name and age, and they explicitly give us consent to use their name and age. the evidence of such permission is in the consent document/resource".</p>

<p>The FHIR Consent has many abilities to identify the 'set' of data that the consent is about. If one only identifies the Patient, with no other constraints on the 'set' then it means all current and future data associated with this Patient. However i can also list Resource by Resource; or it can give a timeframe; or it can give a tag; or by an episode ...... Thus it can identify the set of data in many ways. Mostly ways that have already been found to be useful.</p>

<p>The AuditEvent is more inclusive of being able to record 'use' and 'disclosure' events; where Provenance is more concerned about Create and Update (aka 'collection'). AuditEvent is also able to cover attempts of access that were blocked from happening. So, yes AuditEvent is more intended to support an Access Log, Accounting of Disclosures, or simply evidence that the policies given have been followed.</p>

<p>To your last point about Consent -- Processing -- Data... I think I agree and understand, but I am not 100% clear...    We do have a few elements in Consent intended to make it clear what activities and/or purposeOfUse are authorized (denied).  But these are processing of data, not activities as in a 'consent to treat'. Consent to treat is a work item the committee is now looking at understanding.</p>

<p>I think the AuditEvent is at a different level - in healthcare we are usually interested in capturing every instance of the processing (e.g. if someone gets my history yesterday and today, that is 2 events).<br>

<p>The hospital has to describe their processes and where their processes dictate they use the data: "in my hospital, we use this kind of data at admission and in consultations". <br>

<p>As to the 'documented data processing'. Agree that this documentation should exist before a consent is captured, else that consent is not valid, as it is not informed.

<p>To be sure: when I say Documented data processing, it is kind of in the realm of Enterprise Architecture. <br>
I think I understand and agree with your statement - basically when you get a consent, you point to one of those pre-documented uses of the data, so that patient knows what they are consenting to, in terms of data.</p>

<p>Yes, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194138">@Aaron Seib</span> that is what I mean: consent is just a part of GDPR compliance. Other things are included in GDPR - list of interfaces, list of data that is used, retention.... <br>

<p>On this site we've discussed a lot about the 'problem space', but not a lot about the 'solution space'. My analysis last year (but I'm not a security pundit - <a href="http://www.ringholm.com/column/GDPR_impact_on%20healthcare_data_interoperability.htm" target="_blank" title="http://www.ringholm.com/column/GDPR_impact_on%20healthcare_data_interoperability.htm">http://www.ringholm.com/column/GDPR_impact_on%20healthcare_data_interoperability.htm</a>) was to use at least a combination of consent, provenance, and security labels. </p>
<p>There has been discussion (without a real outcome) on this and other GDPR threads as to how to model 'legal ground for processing' (of which consent is just 1, we need to capture the other 5 as well).  It's simple if a database contains data all having the same legal ground for processing, because one would document that legal ground on paper. But if one collects data of different kinds from all sorts of sources, one needs to know what the 'legal ground' was for capturing the data, for that means one is not allowed to use the data for purposes that are a different 'legal ground'. If one transmits data, it should be accompanied by the original 'legal ground'.</p>
<p>We need to capture retention policies and have the ability to send those along with the data (if resource X has a retention policy for 4 years, and I sent it to another database after 3 years, it will still have '1 year to go' in the other database). Patients have the right to ask for the deletion of their data, and all copies thereof that may exist because data has been sent elsewhere - how would we facilitate that, or would this be solely based on audit logs?</p>
<p>That's just me sketching the likely impact of GDPR on FHIR, someone more in the know about security and similar legislation elsewhere (US?) may have to tackle a more detailed whitepaper as to how we should solve this. Part of the puzzle is the fact that there may be things currently not covered by the FHIR standard, so this may involve the definition of new resources as well.</p>

<p>lighter weight is to use a security-tag in the resources meta element. Where the tag value is likely regional to indicate the specific policy (local vocabulary management).

<p>Will this be trying to address problems of consent, security, or addressing the GDPR in its scope? I am working in Data Governance for GDPR, handling reference data, design and transactional issues, and I would love to see some proper interoperability mechanisms there, but it seems that these discussions are mostly only around security and consent.</p>

<p>Given the background of the FHIR community it would be about the question: how does one, minimalistically if possible, satisfy the requirements of the GDPR when using FHIR and its associated (commonly used) security stack ?  But perhaps others see a wider scope than that.</p>

<p>The answer is more simple... it will address whatever those involved in the activity choose to address... So, if it consists of just Privacy and Security people, then that will be the focus.  I am interested though in what other aspects people see within GDPR? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> can you explain?</p>

<strong>How do we handle Security in FHIR transactions in a GDPR-Compliant way</strong> seems a great topic.<br>
There are other parts of GDPR which may be out of scope - my quest is only that we should not try to think "we're GDPR ready because we have security and access control..."</p>

<p>"Please forget [this specific data]" probably requires an operation. If A sends stuff to B, one can request A to delete some data, but if that data was sent to B, then A (based on its Audit Logs) is aware that it has sent data to B, and should send a request to B to delete. Either one states this is not an automated process, or if it is, it probably calls for an operation because this won't be a client orchestrated activity; the server will have to determine how/what to purge from its records.</p>

<p>The other big worry with this chain is: It might be reasonable for me to forget, but to then expect me to tell all those that I have communicated the data to and get confirmation that they too forgot.. this is NOT what google is expected to do, in fact it is explicitly not in their scope.  To forget locally is either a normal Delete operation, or a tagging of data such that it will not be returned. These are 'reasonable' solutions that FHIR has mechanisms for. As I stated before, we can't claim GDPR compliance. We can only look at the needs that are accepted as falling from GDPR, and map them to reasonable mechanisms that the FHIR standard includes. Going beyond the standard will be the creativity of products/services...</p>
