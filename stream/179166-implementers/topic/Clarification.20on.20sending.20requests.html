<p>I'm currently trying to send a POST request to my api for a CDS-Hooks implementation, but I'm confused on the context and the prefetch fields of the request. My goal is just to send the practioner's email as well as the patient's mrn. I'm currently sending: <br>
{<br>
    "Hook": "patient-view",<br>
    "HookInstance": "1234",<br>
    "Context": {<br>
        "email": "<a href="mailto:test@test.com" title="mailto:test@test.com">test@test.com</a>",<br>
        "mrn": "9999999"<br>
    }<br>
}<br>
So my questions are:<br>
Does the prefetch field work by using data in the context? Does the context field get its values from the prefetch? or are they both prepopulated<br>
How can I check if the ContactType in the practitioner field is type email before getting the value?<br>
What form should my post request look like in addition to what I have?</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated, thank you!</p>
