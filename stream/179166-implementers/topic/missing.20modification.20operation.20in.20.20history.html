<p>On <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html#history">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html#history</a> the following is written: <em>The principal reason a resource might be missing is that the resource was changed by some other channel rather than via the RESTful interface. If the entry.request.method is a PUT or a POST, the entry SHALL contain a resource.</em> - what about <code>PATCH</code>? Is it intentional that it isn't mentioned?</p>

<p>we can discuss it here. We're not going to make rules about this in the spec, but we will recommend that systems do make rules, and we'll mention some of the issues</p>

<p>The general rule with "when do issues come up?" is - if you come to a call and ask for a specific issue to be discussed, we'll try to accommodate.  Otherwise, we go through things more or less from oldest to newest and we get through what we get through on a call.</p>

<p>(When I am chairing, if nobody brings specific issues to the table, I try to focus on questions where the submitter is present on the call. Still trying to figure out the best way to do this, but right now it's basically the visual scan of the attendee list.)</p>

<p>it was quite obvious to me that if I had an issue I was interested in, that it is up to me to take initiative to show up when I can, and poke my jira ticket number into the chat box. The problem with this is when the calls overlap with other priorities, and the risk that I might still be low priority. So having another mechanism to ask prior to the call, to be given priority on the call, would be nice to have.</p>

<p>other factor I have noticed is that sometimes I am interested in the resolution of an issue someone else submitted. I could (often do) add myself as interested, but that doesn't seem to get me invited (zulip chat ping) when that issue comes up for discussion. No idea how to solve this one, as it is two levels away from the process you currently have.</p>

<p>You can certainly ask on the relevant Zulip stream for specific issues to be scheduled on a specific call.  The general rule is "first to ask to be added to the agenda is first dealt with", though occasionally priorities get shuffled due to time-sensitive issues (e.g. ballot).<br>
FHIR-I isn't always as good about paying attention to the "in-person" request as we should be.  It requires someone to notice that's set when the issue comes up for discussion.</p>

<p>the concern is that, as an outsider it is not obvious what fires the workgroup is going to be distracted by that prevent an adhoc "ask" to address my humble little CR. --- note a problem of all workgroups, hence why I have no recommendation</p>

<p>I've attended 2 or 3 meetings recently - or close to - only to be informed that my subject did not make the cut either just up to the meeting or during the meeting - in a timezone that was pretty inconvenient to me. If I was notified that there would be a good chance that my ticket / subject was to be on the agenda, then I wouldn't mind the akward time, but with the current 'amount' of planning, my engagement probably won't increase.</p>

<p>If you feel like you're getting the run-around at calls, then raise it with the co-chairs.  If you don't get satisfaction there, you can raise it with a member of the TSC.  The reality is that schedules are dynamic, length of discussion can be hard to predict, there are time-sensitive actions that can bump lower-priority ones, and skill at managing agendas and making effective use of time varies.  (It's all run by volunteers, after all.)  That said, it should be very unusual for the same item to be on multiple agendas and to get bumped off continuously when there's someone present who wants to speak to it.  If it's happening to you, holler.</p>
