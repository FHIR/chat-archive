<p>During August  Connectathon it was mentioned that, Payer has to make Patient account history available from Jan 1st 2016 for a members as long as they are continued to be covered by that payer, and after membership termination of coverage payer has to keep the data available for 5 more years.<br>
Can you please clarify me following three scenarios?<br>
1)  What if that member obtain coverage with the same payer before end of 5 years (and Payer maintains same account internally)<br>
2)  Member is part of CHIP and he became adult and still covered by MEDICAID<br>
3)    Member moved from commercial to MEDICAID/MEDICARE (Due to financial or retirement) - Do we have to display commercial account also as part of the history!</p>
