<p>I want to like to service list. It consists of service item and corresponding price.<br>
As long as I know, HealthcareService Resource and ChargeItemDefinition Resource are good for this.<br>
But ChargeItemDefinition only refers to instance (Medication, Substance and Device). How should I add price information to HealthcareService Resource? Or should I use another Resource to represent service?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>HealthService refers to a service offered by a specific organization at a particular site - and typically it's not at a level of granularity you'd bill with.  So, for example, you might indicate that a site provides a certain type of MRI services or can do blood draws.  But you wouldn't get down to the fine-grained level that billing codes are typically created at.  (Not all MRI exams or blood draws cost the same.)</p>
<p>I think the vision that most of the time you'd use ChargeItemDefinition and the billing code would go in ChargeItemDefinition.code and that would be it.  What additional details do you want to convey about the actual 'service'?</p>
