<p>Assume a Patient used to visit Hospital A at Florida then he moved to New York. Now he has an appointment at Hospital B in New York. How could his doctor at Hospital B access his clinical data from Hospital A? SMART-on-FHIR in Hospital A may not be able to authenticate a doctor from different hospital. What I can think about is the Patient downloads his medical records to a thumb drive and bring it to his new doctor. Is there any protocol addressing this? Thanks</p>

<p>Normally the NY doc would request a CDA document via something like Carequality.  That does assume both hospitals are part of a Carequality-connected network.  Patient-facilitated data exchange can be option, but it does have some limitations.</p>

<p>Also look at the Da Vinci CDex spec.</p>
