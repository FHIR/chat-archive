<p>Hi, Is there a good example of StructureMap so we can understand its usage, the only example provided does not give any detail about the usability?</p>

<p>what do you mean 'useability'?</p>

<p>From the example I would want to see how it is used , I could understand the alternative way of doing this by using dynamic value with the examples provided. I would want to understand the same by using structuremap for which there is no example...</p>

<p>We are working on example transformations for the specific categories that are defined for ActivityDefinition. Those will be posted to the build as soon as we have them.</p>
