<p>Reading through <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#create" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#create">http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#create</a> I can't quite tell: if I want to successfully create a new resource from a <code>POST</code>, but I also want to return some warnings highlighting issues with the content: can I return a successful response *and* an OperationOutcome? </p>

<p>No.  You can get warnings or content but not both.  The only way to return both was to send one as a header or to throw both in the body and the belief at the time the decision was made is the use-case was esoteric enough that it didn't justify adding that sort of ugliness</p>

<p>there's a preference header for the client to decide what it wants to see - the created resource, or warnings. If the client says so, you can return warnings along with a 201 created</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> (I had assumed a body was illegal with <code>201</code> status, but it looks OK)</p>
