<p>Hi all, we are using procedure resource to capture screening tests and are using snomed codes.  But, not all the screening tests have snomed codes. For example, I did not find snomed code for cervical cancer screening,prostate cancer screening test, gonorrhea screening test,lung cancer and  osteopenia. Also, there are many tests for a particular screening process. Which one should I pick the process or the test? If it is the process, there are no snomed codes for the above mentioned disorders. Is there any alternate code other than snomed code? Thanks in advance</p>

<p>In the US they recommend (mandate) LOINC codes for ordering Pathology/Lab tests (I assume this is what you mean by screening). If you are after a set of SNOMED CT concepts for ordering you could check out the Australian work on this, where they mandate SNOMED CT for orders, and have a process for creating new concepts in the Australian extension. <br>

If you just want to play with a subset of Lab Procedures - this will get you there with no authentication:<br>

<p>Thanks but I did not find LOINC codes for the screening processes lung cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, gonorrhea and osteopenia. Please suggest an alternative.</p>
