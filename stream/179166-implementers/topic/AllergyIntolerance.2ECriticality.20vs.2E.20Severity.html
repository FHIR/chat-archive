<p>What is the difference (i.e., use case) when to use criticality over severity. Both talks about a clinical estimation of the the adverse reaction agent.</p>

<p>In R4, they are two different attributes.  AllergyIntolerance has a criticality which is an estimate of the harm to the identified substance while the reaction has a severity which is the specific severity of that reaction.  A common example that highlights the difference is an allergy to bee stings.  The reaction could have a severity of 'mild' but the criticality of the allergy is 'high' since it is expected that subsequent bee stings will get more and more severe.</p>
