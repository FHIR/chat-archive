<p>It seems that there has been a few parallel efforts for modelling consent directives as a contract resource. As the Security WG is going to discuss this, I'm starting this thread to ask everyone who has done something similar to share it here.</p>

<p>This is something we are looking to accomplish as well. I was looking at the consent directive for some general guidelines and agree with what Grahame stated. Our use-case is MU3 specific for the patients or proxies using apps, and granting those apps access to their health data.</p>

<p>Grahame, I don't understand what you mean by creating a consent record each time a smart on fhir login happens? I see your example, but it looks more like what I would expect in an AuditEvent. A Consent is a record of agreement to share information for a given purpose under given constraints. Are you missing the point?</p>

<p>When you use SMART, you are creating a record of agreement to allow a particular application to access a particular portion of an EHR's record for a particular time.  That sounds like Consent to me.</p>

<p>I actually think the idea of capturing the OAuth consent (embodied in clicking a button on a webpage) as a machine-generated "consent directive" is very interesting. When we worked on the FHIR-UMA demonstration at HIMSS, there was a long debate between the developers and the lawyers whether the consent expressed when the patient approves some kind of access at the UMA authorization server suffices for legal purposes where patient's Consent Directive is required. I think what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  described here is a very interesting step in closing that gap by turning that implicit web event into a potentially reliable legal consent directive.</p>

<p>I would clearly like to separate Consent from Contract. This is not to say that a Consent couldn't be wrapped in a Contract, wrapped in a document... But the model for what would be captured should be a fundamental core Resource.. It might even look very much like Contract, but I doubt it. I wold rather see us design it based on real-world use-cases, and Agile method; getting away from top-down method used now.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> . So as I am collecting and compiling these opinions for the group, what do other implementers think about Consent Directive and Contract? I also heard from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191968">@Ioana Singureanu</span>  that they didn't like using Contract for Consent Directive. How about you <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191357">@Andrew Torres</span>? Is there anyone with an argument FOR keeping Consent Directive a profile of Contract?</p>

<p>Did I imply that the one resource can't handle all use-cases for Privacy consent? It certainly can, and there is a set of examples that cover most of the space.

<p>Yes, they are in the model. There are 9 samples that were brought to us from various places. These are presented to us as what systems do actually do today. It is true that most of the use-cases are what systems do today in an XDS environment. But given there is no FHIR environment, we must pull from existing systems of any type. I find he use-cases translate well, except for a few that are specific to how XDS federates which we didn't include. These are what I used.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191430">@Paul Knapp</span> you have the benefit of understanding both Contract and the Profiling. It looks simple to you. We are hearing it isn't as simple to others.... BUT more to another part of your question, it has taken far too long to get to where we are because we had to cooperate with FM to get Contract changes. This is NOT a negative against FM, nor the very good interface we have. It is simply a fact that owning a Resource is far easier than owning a profile on someone elses resource.  So, although what I presented is mostly a derivative that could be done through profiling; that might not be the case by September. The CBCC community could (if they choose to accept) completely change the Consent Resource without having to align with the modeling that FM has in mind for Contract. Further Consent can still be an attachment on a Contract. -- These are all points that I have made in my presentation of this potentially new pathway.</p>

I agree that whenever a level of indirection is introduced this makes it more conceptual and therefore more difficult than having a native instance. </p>
<p>I am concerned about what this says about FHIR in general as it is dependant on the use of profile on genericized resources. In some cases where we have pushed some far more diverse resources into a single resource your experience suggests those should be revisited to avoid similar situations. Also, if profiles on resources are difficult for implementers then how will profiles on profiles be received by implementers?</p>

<p>I agree it is a data point. The struggle that I have is that today few people manage privacy consents (or other consents) as contracts. That is not to say that they don't have legal text, but they are viewed as something unto themselves. Which is why, I think, people are looking for a consent resource; rather than thinking they should look for a contract with a consent profile. So it is more because of existing practice. </p>

<p>I agree with John. Consent is a computable structure backed by some paperwork somewhere. I think it's saying that Contract itself is a weird construct - the faux computable bit it has is too generic, and it doesn't match a real world construct I recognise</p>

<p>During the WGM, which I was unable to attend, Grahame asked that I prototype the Consent as a Resource 'asap', so I present it today. It has been in the FHIR Build since the beginning of of the week, and some have found it from my blog article, tweets, and <a href="http://chat.fhir.org" target="_blank" title="http://chat.fhir.org">chat.fhir.org</a>. </p>

<p>This is just a proposal, it has no formal standing. It is up to the CBCC community to decide if this is a better path forward vs the previous path of using a profile on Contract. I offer it as a prototype, so that people can make an informed decision. Please let the CBCC (<a href="mailto:cbhs@lists.hl7.org" title="mailto:cbhs@lists.hl7.org">cbhs@lists.hl7.org</a>) know if you like this or not. Getting community input direct to the committee is very important.

<p>Thanks for drafting this, John, I just got to take a look. Here's my use-case for consent:</p>
<p>We have an iOS research app and obviously need to get consent from participants first. This builds on ResearchKit and I'm using a <code>Contract</code> resource to hold our consent terms. I'm using one <code>term</code> per consenting section, giving it a title in <code>term.type.coding[0].code</code>, a one-liner in <code>term.text</code> and (via extension) a file name to a HTML file holding on to one or two paragraphs for the section. The last part is certainly not FHIR-y but works for our iOS-App use-case at the moment. At the end, a review step is presented which concatenates all the <code>term</code> sections into one HTML document (using the title and the paragraphs in the external files), to which the participant can agree and which is then signed.</p>
<p>For <code>subject</code> we contain a <code>Group</code> where the group's <code>characteristic</code> defines the eligibility criteria we have (over 18, lives in the states and such). Before being able to consent, we look at these characteristics and let the user answer them.</p>
<p>An example of the consent flow, with data pulled from the <code>Contract</code>, is in the following video. Eligibility starts at 00:30, consenting at 00:45:<br>
<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6971499/C%20Tracker%20Onboarding.m4v" target="_blank" title="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6971499/C%20Tracker%20Onboarding.m4v">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6971499/C%20Tracker%20Onboarding.m4v</a></p>
<p>In the current <code>Consent</code> proposal I'd have to split out our consenting sections into small <code>friendly</code> (or <code>legal</code>) pieces, either an Attachment or more likely a DocumentReference. Neither are very suitable to host individual sections, and I'd lose the "sexyness" of having the consent in the <code>Consent</code> resource.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Yes. There were other factors as to why we needed the actual text in external files, but a clean solution would be desirable. But I guess this serves to show what I would like to use <code>Consent</code> for.</p>

<p>If you imagine the text in the referenced files being included in the <code>Contract</code>, then we'd have a pretty standard contract/consent, with terms being agreed to. The eligibility part could be a questionnaire, yes.</p>

<p>I'm at the moment figuring our how to represent DNR in FHIR. In our application, it's  recorded as an answer to the question "Is the patient a DNR?" with a Yes/No radio button, and a saved answer of "Yes" should toggle a red DNR on the patient banner.<br>

Can it be recorded as an <code>Observation.code</code> = 304251008 | Resuscitation status (observable entity) with values <code>Observation.value</code> = 304252001 | For resuscitation (finding) (if not DNR), and <code>Observation.value</code> = 304253006 | Not for resuscitation (finding) and <code>Flag.code</code> =<br>
304253006 | Not for resuscitation (finding) (if DNR)?<br>

<p>The modeling for advanced directives has not yet been done, although it is in scope for the Consent resource. To find if a patient as an advanced directive one would search for Consent resources with the Consent.patient of that patient, and with Consent.category of type advanced directive. Likely want to also make sure that you only ask for active resources, etc...   One might have used a Questionnaire originally get this 'consent', but it would be persisted as a Consent resource, possibly linked to the questionaire answers through the Consent.souce element.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191329">@Aleksandra Pavlyshina</span>  Nicely done. I would like to see this captured in a CP or ballot comment so that the CBCC committee is well informed.  Will you do that? My only adjustment is that the Consent.policy would need to be something else. The opt-in policy is a specific Privacy opt-in. That is my perspective. I am not sure I see a reason to have anything in Consent.policy for your use-case.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> Thanks. <br>
I agree, however <code>Consent.policy</code> is 1..1 so I had to put something there, I put 'opt-in' meaning 'allow everything' but 'deny' the action 'For resuscitation (finding) SCTID: 304252001'. <br>
I'm not sure about the <code>Consent.except.code</code> value: should it be <code>Not for resuscitation (finding) SCTID: 304253006</code>?<br>
Also I'm not sure about the <code>Consent.organization</code>(Organization that manages the consent) - is this the organization that owns the application where I'm capturing this information, or is this an attorney's firm, who attested this original document? <br>
I'd love to share this mapping but don't know how. Please advise where to post it, and what is CP? </p>

<p>I can submit it as a comment on your behalf.  The open issues you bring up are important issues for the workgroup to fix. This is why I ask to get your use-case in front of the committee that owns the Resource.  So, coming out of STU3 ballot reconciliation this should be more clear.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191329">@Aleksandra Pavlyshina</span> - I recommend creating a profile that specifies exaclty how you plan to use the Consent resource for DNR (as far as I know you are the first person to apply consent for this purpose)  <br>
I have some comments:<br>
<strong>Consent.organization</strong> would be the organization/provider who will seeks the DNR and later uses is it. I don't think you will have an occasion to specify "Dewey, Cheetham, and Howe, PLC" . <br>
Just to clarify:<br>
If  <strong>Consent.except.type ='deny' </strong> AND <strong>Consent.except.action ='For resuscitation (finding) SCTID: 304252001'</strong> --&gt; it means "do <strong>not</strong> resuscitate"<br>
If  <strong>Consent.except.type ='permit' </strong> AND <strong>Consent.except.action ='For resuscitation (finding) SCTID: 304252001'</strong> --&gt; <strong>allow</strong> resuscitation (this is the <strong>default</strong>, anyway)</p>
<p>It may be useful to create some examples.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191329">@Aleksandra Pavlyshina</span> I would have thought that you don't need exceptions, instead the policy should be a URL that points to a description of the actual policy "For resuscitation" or to a description of the actual policy for "do not resuscitate". These policies should describe what is meant by "for resuscitation" and by "do not resuscitate" - what is allowed, what is not allowed (e.g. defibrillation). If the organization collecting it does not have defined clear policies for this, it could just point to a legal statute of their jurisdiction that explains it. If your client deals with multiple jurisdiction and does not want to include any specifics in the consent, you could define a URI and describe the meaning (e.g. simply "DNR, where the details are defined by the applicable jurisdiction"). </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191968">@Ioana Singureanu</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191586">@Tarik Idris</span> Thank you very much for your feedback and clarifications.<br>
I removed <code>Consent.except</code>, changed <code>Consent.organization</code>to 'Reference to Organization representing our care management application where the Consent resource is created', and changed <code>Consent.policy</code> to the fake URI <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/ConsentPolicy/not-for-resuscitation</code>. <br>
Also, since <code>Consent.category</code> is 0..*, does it make sense to add one more category value <code>Not for resuscitation (finding) SCTID: 304253006</code>?<br>
I'm going to create a profile for the Consent resource for DNR later then.</p>
