<p>Which method would you intuitively used to represent a service that is being scheduled?  Is a simple CodeableConcept sufficient (e.g. Schedule.serviceType), or would you want a full resource (e.g. HealthcareService, CatalogEntry, ActivityDefinition, a new resource, etc.)?</p>
<p>Note that I'm not asking what <em>should</em> be used in the current spec.  I'm asking what seems to be the most intuitive.</p>

<p>I suspect it depends what you have available and what detail you need to refine - same sort of thing as medications.  If you've got a registry of stuff, pointing to that registry is useful.  If all you've got is a code system, that's what you'll use.  And if you need to (and have the capability to) create a customized version specific for what you're doing, that might exist as a contained or even a custom instance in the registry</p>

<p>We are considering making serviceType a CodeableReference to HealthcareService, such that HealthcareService is the resource that represents the set of schedulable services.  This gives HealthcareService a dual meaning, so we'd have a "class" (name tbd) property to differentiate.</p>

<p>HealthcareService is  not about a 'specific' service, but more a capability.  So you might have a HealthcareService for "imaging" or "lab", but you'd never have a HealthcareService instance for "Head CT scan" or "Hemoglobin".</p>

<p>Many implementers <em>do</em> create HealthcareService resources for stuff like CT scans.  The problem is that everyone except insider standards nerds intuitively arrive at HealthcareService as the resource to use (based on several Jira  trackers, some chat.fhir threads, and personal experience).  So PA is considering making that "official" so that the the standards nerds and everyone else are aligned.</p>

<p>I'd rather that we change the name of HealthcareService if there's that much confusion.  Much of the elements on HealthcareService make zero sense when you're talking about fine-grained service definitions.</p>

<p>Also, for fine-grained, we already have a resource for ActivityDefinition, ObservationDefinition and ChargeItemDefinition, so if we wanted ayet another resource that lived at that same granularity, its purpose would need to be clearly distinct.</p>

<p>I actually took a full pass at the HealthcareService properties, and they almost all line up with exactly what we have in our schedulable service (which we call a visit type).  That is <em>why</em> we (Epic) landed on HealthcareService - it wasn't because of the name.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>One of the example uses of HealthcareService stated in the spec is for National Service Directories - and that's how it's being used in NZ. This usage does require details of specific services  (including granular availability details) and a fair number of extensions. Maybe an additional resource might better serve this use case but IMO , and for R4 anyway, HealthcareService is the best resource for service directories.</p>

<p>Luckily you can also use a retrospective approach. :)</p>
<p>In Finnish specification (<a href="https://simplifier.net/FinnishSchedulingR4">https://simplifier.net/FinnishSchedulingR4</a>) HealthcareService is referenced. It is profiled to refer to a national code system of healthcare service types (see <a href="https://simplifier.net/guide/FinnishSchedulingR4ImplementationGuide/Scopeandbasicscenario">https://simplifier.net/guide/FinnishSchedulingR4ImplementationGuide/Scopeandbasicscenario</a>).</p>

<p>Hello! Who can provide an up-to-date summary of this discussion? What are the next practical steps?<br>
1) The FHIR community is going to rename the HealthcareService resource and leave the scope of resource as "class of service" (like "lab", "imaging", etc.)<br>
2) or extend (add ref) the scheduling resources like slot, schedule, appointment, and use HealthcareService as a specific service item (CT scan, MRI, etc.). - <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-22687">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-22687</a><br>

<p>How can one differentiate between HealthcareService instances that are "service catalog" type things vs. what the resource was originally created for - a high-level capacity available at a specific site (e.g. imaging, emergency, etc.)?  Some of the attributes on HealthcareService (e.g. endpoint, availabilityTime) really make no sense when you're talking about a catalog entry at a detailed procedure code level.</p>
