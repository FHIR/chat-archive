<p>It is important to specify where an Appointment takes place. The Appointment resource documentation describes this clearly like this:</p>
<p>12.10.2.3 Appointment Locations and Participation <br>
The location of the appointment is to be defined by using a participant that references a Location or HealthcareService resource.<br>
This permits the location to also have its availability checked via a schedule and any conflicts more easily managed.</p>
<p>When looking at <em>participant</em> it has the following elements:<br>
<strong>type</strong>    Σ   0..*    CodeableConcept Role of participant in the appointment<br>
Participant type (Extensible)<br>
<strong>actor</strong>   Σ   0..1    Reference(Patient | Practitioner | PractitionerRole | RelatedPerson | Device | HealthcareService | Location)    Person, Location/HealthcareService or Device<br>
<strong>required</strong>    Σ   0..1    code    required | optional | information-only<br>
ParticipantRequired (Required)<br>
<strong>status</strong> Σ   1..1    code    accepted | declined | tentative | needs-action<br>
ParticipationStatus (Required)<br>
<strong>period</strong>      0..1    Period  Participation period of the actor</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br>
The type only seems to be valid for actors that are people, and not locations (or devices or services). How is the <em>type</em> element intended to be used for an <em>actor</em> that is a Location?</p>
<p>Just not use it? That doesnt seem like a good option to me, as the type ideally should specify the role the actor is playing, and as we have a generic actor representation we would need to build business logic to figure out which type of actor is being provided and would want to do that based on a coded value.</p>
<p>So maybe extend that value set with roles that are also valid for locations? But then location for the appointment seems to be such a common use case that there should be a code included in this value set already. </p>
<p>Or have I misunderstood something about how to use Location for an Appointment? (there is a larger discussion that could be had as well about the role of the Slot  and it's HealthcareService in determining the Location for the Appointment)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>The binding to Participant type is <a href="http://build.fhir.org/terminologies.html#extensible" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/terminologies.html#extensible">extensible</a>, so extra values are permitted. <br>
I expect there are no values suitable for locations for historical reasons (because the current values come from a value set that had no need for them).<br>
I agree with your interpretation of how to represent the location of an appointment.<br>
I suggest that you create a GForge ticket to add values to the value set for the cases that you want.</p>

<p>That and you don't need a type if you're selecting a location explicitly (which is usually done while booking)</p>
