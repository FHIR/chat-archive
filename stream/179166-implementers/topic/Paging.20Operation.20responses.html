<p>Is there a suggested way to page Operation responses (I'm looking more for guidance/ideas than for a spec answer, since I don't think there is anything in the spec)?    My current thought is to have the Operation include an out parameter that is the "next-archive" pointer (from RFC 5005 Archived Feeds).  </p>
<p>The specific use case is Provider Directory.  We are currently thinking of an Operation to pull down the directory.  However there are a few components of the directry:<br>
1. A parameter containing a Bundle (type=collection) of Endpoint/Organization/Practitioner/PractitionerRole/etc.<br>
2. A parameter containing "metadata" about the directory.  TBD on the structure of that.</p>
<p>I don't think the normal Bundle paging approach would work well because you want to page the entire set of parameters, not just the bundle parameter.</p>
<p>An alternative is to just have the Operation return a Bundle at the top (i.e. no Parameters/parameter), and find a way to fit the metadata inside the bundle.  I'm open to ideas/opinions on approach.</p>

<p>I'm not following why this isn't just a paged search</p>

<p>The standard bundle paging should be fine. Its just to keep getting the next data, it's not for a single type.<br>
So the operation should return a bundle.<br>
It's not a search, as there are multiple resource types, and could also include deletes (I would hope - not sure if you've documented that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191764">@Cooper Thompson</span> got the sample operationdefinition somewhere?)</p>

<p>still not understanding why it's not a search - you can search across multiple resources</p>
