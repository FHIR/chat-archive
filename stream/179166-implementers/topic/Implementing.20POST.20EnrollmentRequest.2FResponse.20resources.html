<p>Hello,<br>
We're planning to use the enrollmentRequest and response to implement a patient portal invite/registration workflow.<br>
I had a topic on this earlier and was pointed to afew resources we could use- we like the enrollmentrequest and response resource- thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <br>
My question is around the RESTparadigm- if we POST a enrollmentrequest- can we expect the FHIR server to return an enrollmentresponse as a response? Is this breaking rules anywhere?<br>
Thanks!<br>
Priya</p>

<p>Yes, that's breaking the rules.  A simple POST to the resource endpoint will just create the resource.  If you want back a response resource you need to invoke an operation.  Take a look at the workflow pages for other options</p>
