<p>I am seeking clarification on 2 things. Suppose I have a RequestGroup referencing a Request. Further suppose I have a Task seeking to fulfill the referenced Request.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is it appropriate for Task.focus to reference the Request or the RequestGroup? Since the RequestGroup defines the context for the Request, this implies to me that the Request does have some independence from it's parent RequestGroup, but because of the tight dependence of the Request on the RequestGroup, I wanted to make sure this made sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am wondering if Task.focus is the Request, is it appropriate to set Task.basedOn to the RequestGroup? The wording of Task.basedOn is  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>BasedOn refers to a higher-level authorization that triggered the creation of the task. It references a "request" resource such as a ServiceRequest, MedicationRequest, ServiceRequest, CarePlan, etc. which is distinct from the "request" resource the task is seeking to fulfill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not sure if the RequestGroup is a "higher-level authorization that triggered the creation of the task" since the Request and RequestGroup are all part of the same request.</p>

<p>Task.focus is "what are you performing the Task.code action on".  Task.basedOn is "under what authority are you performing the Task.code".  In general, it would never make sense for an overall order to authorize the execution of a child order.  The only time you'd have a Task.basedOn with a "fulfills" request is if it's something completely separate - e.g. "Please suspend prescription 123 based on order for admission 456"</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, this makes sense. I guess this would be like an order authorizing the execution of itself, which doesn't make sense (as you state <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Task.20.22based.20on.22.20vs.22.20focus.22/near/153875547">here</a>).</p>
<p>If 1) CarePlan B is issued basedOn CarePlan A and 2) Request C is issued basedOn CarePlan B, does it suffice to have Request C basedOn CarePlan B only, should Request C be basedOn CarePlan B, or should Request C to be based on CarePlan B and CarePlan A?</p>

<p>It's up to you whether you want to list everything in the chain, a subset of the chain, or only the leaf-level.  It comes down to "what does the recipient need, how often do the need it, and do they have the ability to trace the chain if they don't have what they need?"</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> Thanks for taking a look! It's much appreciated. Yes, you are correct that if a green Task fails, then it's possible that the entire RequestGroup would be failed or complete. We were going to leave that up to the Requesting system to determine whether Tasks are "sufficiently" completed to say that the RequestGroup Request is complete.</p>
