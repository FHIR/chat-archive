<p>I have added a Tracker Item (<a href="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=24690" target="_blank" title="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=24690">GF#24690</a>) asking for clarification around Medication.amount, but maybe someone around here can comment:</p>
<p>Since Medication.package has been removed from Medication in R4, I assume the intent is to roll up different package sizes of the same Medication into one Medication resource instance and move the information about the package size to MedicationRequest.dispenseRequest.amount and MedicationDispense.amount.</p>
<p>However, it in not clear how to use Medication.amount in this scenario, since it still refers to the "amount in package" even though the Medication resource seems no longer tied to one specific package size.</p>
<p>To clarify:</p>
<p>Assuming there are 3 package sizes of "Bayer Aspirin 500", with 10, 25 and 50 tablets, I would assume they are all represented by the same Medication "Bayer Aspirin 500".</p>
<p>In this scenario, what would the Medication.amount be?</p>

<p>Medication can be at multiple levels - so you would have one identifier for the different package sizes.  You would have an identifier for the Bayer Aspirin 500 in a package of 10 vs a package for 25 or 25.  If you have the generic Aspirin 500mg - there would be no packaging information.</p>

<p>ok, after some reading up on the scope, I think I was under the misconception that package had been removed from Medication when it has rather been rolled into amount with package.content.amount -&gt; amount.numerator and package.container -&gt; amount.denominator, is that correct?</p>

<p>I would like to reopen this topic, but in a sligthly different context. </p>
<p>How can i represent complex packages? For Example: Dolomo Tn Tablets 27 pieces. 9 tablets are coffein-based (ingredient: Coffein) and 18 codein-based (ingredient: Codein) tablets .</p>

So ingredient.itemreference will link an ingredient. This should work, even if all the referenced medicationprofiles have the same ingredient or the .ingredient is not populated explicit, since it is hidden/coded in medication.code (manufactured product). </p>

<p>Sounds a bit like these are two completely different medications that happened to end up in one box. I'd say we either look at this as two different medications and figure out a way to link them together or we try to figure out under which circumstances systems need to be aware of this detail and whether it would be ok to just say amount = 27{tablets}, ingredient = x mg caffeine + y mg codeine and only specify the dirtribution into different pills  in an extension...?<br>
(probably depends whether Medication is used in the context of MedicationRequest or MedicationAdministration)</p>

<p>The medication definition resources are designed to cope with this sort of thing and have all the package detail you can want. May be more than you need for prescribing, but if you have a catalogue of medications then you are covered.  It is common to have different medications in the same pack, forming one product. Thrush treatment and contraceptive pill are the most common examples. Have a look at <a href="http://build.fhir.org/medication-definition-module.html">http://build.fhir.org/medication-definition-module.html</a></p>

<p>Medication was not built to represent complex packages.  It is intended to identify a manufactured product with a code and optional manufacturer, form, and batch information.  Or it can represent a compounded preparation with the ingredient listing.  But if you are trying to describe a manufactured product, then one of the other resources - MedicationKnowledge or MedicinalProductDefinition - should be used depending on your use case.</p>

<p>If you're prescribing a combo product, generally you'd just specify the code for that combo product.   Same thing for dispense.  The dosage instructions would typically be just text.  If you needed to, you could put an extension in the dosage instruction to refer to the distinct package components to allow you to convey distinct dosage instructions for each.</p>

<p>I have somewhat different requirements in a project and I will look into MedicationKnowledge. For this I see an overlap with Medication which supports describing ingredients but the Medication resource is meant to describe that in transactional data - for example describing the ingredients when prescribing a magistral formula. For master data, MedKnowledge is more appropriate.</p>

<p>At first complex packages are common in germany</p>
<p>I have two main use-cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An existing registry for medications (PZN-Number) ist not valid on its own. In addition to PZN packages have to be described completely (on a high level) by law. So in a case of prescription , we need to have these highly detailed packageinformations. So we can't use medication.code only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to know how long this medication will last (for one costumer) you need to know how many e.g. tablets are inside exactly. you can calculate when this customer will need the next package.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>i think: Usage of MedicationKnowledge will lead to a huge overhead, since (in my use-case) i would use .packaging only. The rest of this resource is not necessary. We will discuss this problem internally, but the "misuse-option" is an option.</p>
