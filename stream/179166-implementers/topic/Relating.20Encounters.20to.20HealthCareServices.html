<p>If an organisation has a detailed Service Provider Directory and wants to ensure that all healthcare activity is associated with the relevant healthcare service, then how is this linkage supported in FHIR?  At present, this looks like it is only possible for a given encounter as long as that encounter was the result of a planned appointment within an established schedule for a given healthcare service.  Just wondering if I am missing anything here?</p>

<p>The HealthcareService resource hasn't had much of an outing outside of the Service Provider Directory space, and limited within that scope, so we haven't modeled that part as yet.<br>
If you have considered mapping your internal directory to healthcare service resources we'd love to hear how it has gone and if you have any feedback for us.</p>

<p>Once that resource has had more exposure, we'll be looking into the other side of how it might link from other resources.</p>
