<p>I have a little bit of confusion around the usage of "entered-in-error". Is "entered-in-error" a convention that all FHIR resources will/should support to represent a "soft-deleted" record? It seems that most (but strangely, not all) resources have some sort of status attribute that can be set to "entered-in-error". From a general framework perspective, I would think a consistent representation of "soft-deleted" should be adhered to.</p>
<p>Does anyone have insight into why there are resources that don't support this status (or resources that don't have a status attribute at all)?</p>

<p>All resources are required to have entered-in-error or receive a waiver.  Some resources (Parameters, OperationOutcome, etc.) aren't generally persisted and there isn't a use-case for it</p>

<p>Ok, I think that makes sense for non-persistable resources. So it seems like an alternative to "entered-in-error" might be the use of "active". Are there guidelines for when "active" is used instead of "status".</p>

<p>If you've got a state machine that is essentially a boolean, then we allow just 'active'.</p>

<p>Ok, another tangential question regarding soft-deleted: Have implementers generally redacted resources that are returned in search bundles that are in "entered-in-error" status? I have seen this referenced in this conversation <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Are.20search.20parameters.20like.20filters.3F/near/165671520">here</a>, however I have not seen it referenced much outside of that one conversation. Would the proper way to implement that involve returning the resource with a "REDACTED" meta field in the bundle, but allowing for a full non-redacted read on that resource using the READ interaction for legitimate uses of that soft-deleted resource?</p>

<p>I don't recall ever having discussion about this.</p>

<p>No, resource that are entered-in-error MUST be returned by searches, otherwise downstream systems would not be able to fix their copies (if they retain copies)</p>

<p>I wasn't referring to removing the entries entirely from the search, that conversation I linked goes into great detail into why that is a bad idea.. There was a comment in that thread about returning a REDACTED resource, as the attributes aside from "id" and "status" may no longer be relevant or pose patient safety risks to return.</p>

<p>Oh got it, sorry I misunderstood</p>
