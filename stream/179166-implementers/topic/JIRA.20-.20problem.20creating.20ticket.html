<p>I was just trying to create a JIRA ticket (maybe my first at <a href="http://jira.hl7.org" target="_blank" title="http://jira.hl7.org">jira.hl7.org</a>) are was puzzled by the fact that after filling out all fields marked as required, clicking on "Create" did nothing.  There was no error message, and the dialog box stayed open.  It wasn't until I opened the developer tools that I saw a message in the console that said "Work group must not be empty".  I returned to the dialog box and could not find a "work group" field-- until I thought to click on the "advanced" tab, where I found it, and was finally able to create the ticket.</p>
