<p>We are planning to support multiple FHIR versions in a single endpoint using the <code>fhirVersion</code> MIME type parameter as described in <a href="http://build.fhir.org/versioning.html">http://build.fhir.org/versioning.html</a>, supporting R4 in addition to the existing STU3 version. We are planning to isolate the versions in distinct silos and any references between resources with different versions are not allowed. This is done so that searches with includes result in a Bundle corresponding to a single version. (Example: R4 Observation pointing to STU3 Patient and a search for /Observation?_include=Observation:subject:Patient will yield a bundle with mixed versions)<br>
However, what to do if the client supports both versions with a preference for one? For example: <br>
GET /Observation?criteria with <code>Accept: application/fhir+json;fhirVersion=4.0, application/fhir+json;fhirVersion=3.0;q=0.5</code><br>
Is this even allowed? How is the server to identify which version silo to query?</p>

<p>I think you can safely assume that client would expect only one version. I would advise against using the fhirVersion mime type - just use separate end points, that's the standard way everyone uses currently</p>

<p>The main issue with the multiple endpoint approach will come when IGs start being non-compatible.  Then you'd need to have different endpoints for each non-compatible profile.  I honestly expected more non-compatible IGs b y now, so maybe I'm wrong that day won't come and this won't end up being an issue.</p>

<p>The largest problem I ran into (having done a test server that way) is that clients generally do not include that parameter.  If we could go back in time and make it the recommended (or even required) practice to include it, a single endpoint would work well.  Without that, the applications that use your 'default' version (e.g., if you accept a non-versioned MIME type) will work and  other users will ask for an endpoint with the other default.</p>

<p>Yes Lloyd, but my point is that clients typically don't include the version parameter on the MIME type.  In my experience, most clients (regardless of which version they implement) simply send <code>application/fhir+json</code>.  Asking a majority of clients to change their software doesn't lend itself to wide/easy adoption.</p>

<p>Exactly.  While the specs indicate how this <em>should</em> work, in practice (since most clients don't provide the info), providing multiple versions in a single endpoint doesn't work well.</p>
<p>Just wanted to be clear on expectations...  If someone is developing both sides, this works great.  If you're developing a server, most clients won't support it.  And, if you're developing a client; <span aria-label="shrug" class="emoji emoji-1f937" role="img" title="shrug">:shrug:</span>  (I <em>assume</em> most servers won't balk at it, but most servers I know of only support one version at an endpoint anyway).</p>

<p>If a single endpoint supports multiple versions, HTTP content negotiation determines what you get back.  Thus far, we don't have a use-case for knowing all versions a server supports.  What matters is "do you support any of the versions I do?" and "What's the most preferred version you support of those I support".</p>

<p>Are we misrepresenting HTTP specs when we say using the content-type will not work though? To play the devil's advocate, from the HTTP standpoint, I don't see why using content-type is any different from a separate path. Even the questions about the metadata endpoint should be resolvable by the request content-type to the metadata endpoint (CapabilityStatement will respond for R4 and STU3, Conformance will respond for DSTU2)?</p>

<p>Once we get into R5, R6, R7 where the resources you support are essentially identical across all of those releases, it's going to suck to have to stand up a new endpoint only to spit out the same content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometime back, I had asked if we can have a resource level FHIR version, so the same endpoint can mix and match resources - and perhaps transform libraries can help the client (and/or the server) where the desired version isn't available..</p>

<p>You can't mix versions because schemas, reference implementations and other things all depend on consistent versioning.  Even when we get to the point where 'many' artifacts are locked down and remain compatible from release to release, that doesn't mean all of them will be - and there can still be addition of new elements that will cause at least some issues.  So all Bundles and other collections will still have to be restricted to a single version.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Followup question: Is <code>fhirVersion</code> parameter also relevant for _format? It makes sense for full MIME types application/[fhir+]xml and application/[fhir+]json but is <code>_format=json;fhirVersion=4.0</code> valid?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should I add a task for clarifying use of fhirVersion in _format?</p>

<p>Currently it wasn't intended to do that, but you could create a Jira issue to propose a change.</p>
