<p>Hi all. <br>
I am trying to implement a billing part of the FHIR in our system. As far as I understand we should use ChargeItemDefinition(CID) with the corresponding context in order to assign a billing artifact to the encounter. So from the business analytics our requirement looks as follows:<br>
We must have a list of Contracts with all the organization for reimbursement. <br>
In the context of the encounter the practitioner will search for all ChargeItemDefinitions which are applicable with the corresponding contract. So for that reason the ChargeItemDefinition must have a relation to Contract in order to be searchable in that context.<br>
From that perspective we have a few approaches.</p>
<ol>
<li>We can use an identifier with specific value or code which corresponds to the particular contract. </li>
<li>We can use a jurisdiction with a CodeableConcept which corresponds to the particular Contract. </li>
<li>Or we can use a ChargeItemDefinition.useContext.valueCodeableConcept to mark a specific Contract.<br>
In these ways the choosing which  ChargeItemDefinition is applicable,  will be performed by search request against the FHIR database. </li>
</ol>
<p>However we can use a completely different approach. We can load all the ChargeItemDefinitions in the client application (which is a WEB based app) and can use a ChargeItemDefinition.applicability with rules applied for each usage context.  If we have a thousands of CIDs this will make the client application heavier to load. </p>
<p>Please share your experience with the  billing engine implementation over the FHIR standard. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
