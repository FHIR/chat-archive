<p>We are using QuestionnaireResponse to capture some of the surveys we adminster to our patients. The resource only has In Progress, Completed and Amended as values of Status. Our business partners also want to capture Not Completed as another final state, in those cases where the patient maybe does not speak English, or passed out or was hospitalized during the process. There is not expectation the QuestionnaireResponse will be revisited again. We are currently thinking or leaving the status as In Progress and adding some info into Text to document there was some adverse event or issue. I am wondering if you have any thoughts on this approach or if there are any others that have voiced the need to capture Not Completed for QuestionnaireResponse.</p>

<p>It's not a use-case I've heard, but it seems like a reasonable request.  It's probably late to get into STU 3, but you can submit a change request and see what happens.  If not, then I'd probably go with a status of "In Progress" and an extension.</p>

<p>Is this more like an abandoned status?</p>
