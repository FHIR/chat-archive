<p>I'm trying to get back up to speed on FHIR; a lot has happened since I was last able to focus on it.  Can anyone help me understand the difference in intent between ImagingObjectSelection and ImagingManifest?  They both seem to roughly correspond to a KOSD.</p>

<p>ImagingObjectSelection has undergone a lot of transformation over time. It started out as a KOS equivalency - but we found that generated some confusion of when to use what (when would you use a DICOM KOS and when would you use ImagingObjectSelection). We looked then deeper at the use cases - and the primary (and only) use case we identified for ImagingObjectSelection was to support IHE Radiology's MHD-I profile. Thus, we also decided to change the name to reflect the real use case of it - and thus, it became ImagingManifest. However, as IHE Radiology looked more deeply at their MHD-I profile - they have seemingly determined that it would be better to use ImagingStudy, rather than ImagingManifest - they are meeting at the end of February and hopefully confirm that decision for moving forward. So - that eliminates the usecase of ImagingManifest entirely - so we will llikely see it fade away over time. This reflects upon the FMM maturity for ImagingManifest (which we pegged for being 0 or draft for STU3 for this resource). </p>
<p>Dan - does that address your question?</p>

<p>Thank you  very much, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191960">@Brad Genereaux</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> !<br>
Let's see if I've got it right:  ImagingManifest replaced ImagingObjectSelection, and there are no known use cases for either, so pay no attention to the resources behind the curtain.  If so, then "Yes", you've totally answered my question.<br>
By the way, Brad, I really enjoyed your videos from Amsterdam.  And Lloyd, you were my initial teacher for FHIR, and it was a great introduction.  Thanks to you both!</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193333">@Dan Konigsbach</span> ! And yes, you've got that correct. </p>
