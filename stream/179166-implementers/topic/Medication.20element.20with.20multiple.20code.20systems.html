<p>Hi all, how can an element in the Medication refer to multiple code systems (RxNorm, NDC,SNOMED CT etc)? Thank you</p>

<p>Hi. AFAIK, it can't :) <br>
And AFAIK, It shouldn't (not directly) - that association may be context-sensitive. e.g. a same medication can be in two ATC classes, depending on its use.</p>

<p>Medication is identified by Medication.code which is a CodeableConcept.  CodeableConcept supports multiple Coding repetitions.  You can send as many codes for the medication with as many code systems and as many levels of granularity as you might wish.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span>, there certainly is a need to definitionally define the hierarchy of medication concepts.  This won't be done using Catalog or ConceptMap, but rather the new resource that Pharmacy and BR&amp;R are working on that describes medication definitions.  Only that will allow the proper representation of strengths, manufacturer, formulation, packaging and other aspects that the different levels of coding bring into play.  However, that's not the use-case being conveyed here.  There are times where when you're recording a part of the patient's medical record that you want to capture multiple levels of granularity and/or codes from multiple code systems <em>as part of the patient record</em> (not as definitional information).  This is typically because different downstream systems - claims, decision support, etc. - need different codes and those systems don't have access to the definitional information to perform the code translation themselves.  In such a case, multiple codings will be sent as translations within the CodeableConcept.  Typically these translations will be handled by the source system automatically translating the selected code into the needed alternative code systems/granularities.  However, in some cases the user might be involved in picking the appropriate code from each system.  (This latter approach has a higher likelihood of inconsistent codes accidentally being selected.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191337">@Dion McMurtrie</span>  might be interested in this discussion - he is looking at FHIR medication concepts hierarchies for the Australian Medicines Terminology  (AMT).<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span>  we are looking to support a platform for prescribing and dispensing to allow one or more of the codings seen commonly; this includes proprietary, common drug databases, nominated national terminology, procurement, and possibly national subsidy coding.  i.e. for us here that means  MIMS, AMT, GTIN, PBS.  We also are looking at multiple granularities using the AMT like you paracetamol list  we have types Medicinal Product Pack, Trade Product Pack, Medicinal Product, Containered Trade Product etc.  We may have more that one level e.g. TPP + MPP for pack level prescribing, this mainly applies to AMT in our case.   To represent the codes for STU3 we use repeating Medication.code.coding  for this and are looking at an extension on Coding to supply a coded 'Medication Type' to identify the granularity level for systems/cases that don't have terminology services to distinguish the type of coding (i.e. multiple AMT codes are all in the <a href="http://snomed.info/sct" target="_blank" title="http://snomed.info/sct">http://snomed.info/sct</a> Coding.system and could not distinguish granularity level without terminology services)  - any other approaches than extension?

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> I agree that sometimes you may want to provide several levels of granularity, other times you don't - that is ok, and of course you can say "this drug is Doliprane, but you may want to know this is Paracetamol". Sometimes you may not write any codes at all. From the requirements I am aware of, the way to define the hierarchy should be flexible and context-specific, and I don't think medication has a way to do this. I can bring forth some requirements for medication identification, but i observe they are being met with a combination of the work on Catalog, BRR and Medication, so i trust things are moving in the right direction. BRR is working on IDMP resources, and when we work with IDMP we need to combine the IDMP standard model with the different concepts existing out there. Medication is finally rid of an attibute called "isBrand" and is a flatter structure, which allows specifying or defining different concepts. and Catalog allows linking dependencies - of course we can put them in a medicationKnowledge resource, but from my experience with catalogs, this will be plagued with extensions or be a SPL-like mechanism.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191337">@Dion McMurtrie</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191368">@Brett Esler</span> i have requested to replace medication.isBrand" with medication.conceptType - i do not know if this was followed through, or if it is considered to be in code.system.  Technically I am ok with both, but if I look at e.g. SNOMED, it would be much better to have a "conceptType", for the reasons you mention. Could be medication.conceptType, or medication.code.conceptType - i hadn't thought of the latter, but i don't see why not.<br>
Also, I am looking at this from a perspective where there are many concepts, and they have a polyhierarchical relationship. And there is always one more concept, or clusters...<br>
This is why we are procuring a Catalog that is a graph, because the information and relations evolve over time, because of new findings, regulations, best practices, procurement agreements, distribution rules..</p>

<p>So, I agree we can use several codes on a medication - but that is just providing additional information and does not define the medication. You cannot risk prescribing dafalgan and charging for doliprane just because they are both Paracetamol.</p>

<p>If you just want to explain "what kind of a product or concept this is", indeed you just need a ConceptType to look in the local, national, international lists they may have, from substance identification like GINAS to GS1's GTIN.</p>

<p>I suspect if several codes are sent, they'd likely be sent on the MedicationRequest/MedicationStatement/MedicationDispense/MedicationAdministration, not the Medication.  You use Medication if you need to specify additional details like ingredients, lot number, etc. at which point sending multiple codes tends to make less sense.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191368">@Brett Esler</span> I actually requested a change to medication.isBrand too, but I requested a "brand" CodeableConcept be added so that if I know the brand name text, or even the code of the brand and its display name it can be added. That can be found at <a href="https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13536&amp;start=0" target="_blank" title="https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13536&amp;start=0">https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13536&amp;start=0</a></p>
<p>The medication.conceptType is useful to know what granularity/level the medication resource instance is representing. The presence/absence of populated elements isn't a good way to determine what level of thing the Medication resource represents. I've added an extension in my AMT Medication resource service which is an extension of the Medication resource itself, but having spoken to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191368">@Brett Esler</span> last week it sounds like it would be better moved to medication.code.conceptType. I'm yet to prototype that to reconfirm my understanding with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191368">@Brett Esler</span> </p>
<p>Examples of what I've done can be found at <a href="https://medserve.online" target="_blank" title="https://medserve.online">https://medserve.online</a> where there's a Postman collection showing some example, and now a browser built on top of it. I'll try and get the examples changed to medication.code.conceptType using extensions and comment back when I've done that.</p>

<p>On the multiple codes for a Medication resource, it does get really confusing (at least for me) when a Medication resource has multiple codings - what does the Medication resource actually mean keeping in mind that these codings (translations really) are likely at different levels of granularity and therefore meaning.</p>
<p>So I've been inclined in the work that I've done transforming AMT into a catalogue of Medication resources (see <a href="https://medserve.online" target="_blank" title="https://medserve.online">https://medserve.online</a>) I've tried to stick to just the AMT code the Medication resource is representing. Other codes like our PBS subsidy codes or ARTG regulatory codes I've tried to push out. </p>
<p>For the PBS code I've tried to push that out to a "subsidy" extension, which from a catalogue perspective a Medication can have 0 or more subsidies applicable under different rules in different jurisdictions. Similarly for the regulators code (ARTG in Australia) I'm working on a "regulation" extension to land that code in along with the data from the regulator relevant to that licence. In both cases I don't believe the PBS code and ARTG codes are actually medication identifiers - one identifies a subsidy and the rules under which it is valid, the other represents a licence to market and sell a medication in a jurisdiction. They can be used as proxies for identifying a medication, but they aren't really medication codes like AMT or MIMS in Australia or RxNorm in the US.</p>
<p>But <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191368">@Brett Esler</span> you put a good case last week where multiple codings were needed in Medication resource instances, some even from the same code system. Do you still feel this is the case? My inclination in this case is to add something to them to indicate how synonymous they are (or are being asserted to be in this context of use) to the "primary" code for the resource.</p>

<p>i think it would hold partially for specifying - you can also say "i prescribe dafalgan, but be informed this is paracetamol, in case you want to do grouping or substitution" - this kind of holds, but with pitfalls.</p>

<p>In both cases I don't believe the PBS code and ARTG codes are actually medication identifiers - one identifies a subsidy and the rules under which it is valid, the other represents a licence to market and sell a medication in a jurisdiction. They can be used as proxies for identifying a medication, but they aren't really medication codes like AMT or MIMS in Australia or RxNorm in the US.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So, AMT has only 2 types of codes that are real tangible things - the TPUU which is a branded unitary product like "Panadol 500mg tablet" and CTPP which is a branded pack of one or more unitary products or other packages, like "Panadol 500mg tablet, 24, blister pack". The other "levels" in AMT (of which there are 4) are abstract concepts which subsume one or more of these more tangible things. That allows us to represent "Panadol 500mg tablet, 24" which subsumes all the various 24 packs (bottles, blister packs etc), or "paracetamol 500mg tablet" which would subsume all the different branded versions of that tablet - take a look at <a href="https://browse.medserve.online/Medication/23628011000036109" target="_blank" title="https://browse.medserve.online/Medication/23628011000036109">https://browse.medserve.online/Medication/23628011000036109</a> which shows there's 311 of them!</p>
<p>For package products the subsidy is sometimes expressed at the "Panadol 500mg tablet, 24" level, i.e. the government doesn't care which type of pack you supply the subsidy is the same for that brand and quantity. Mostly the subsidy code is the same for all the different brands at that level, but sometimes not.</p>
<p>The point is generating these Medication resources from AMT, I'm generating both abstract things and tangible things, but sometimes someone wants to say one or the other. My real aim to this was to provide an API to access the content and definitions of AMT concepts in an easier way to process.</p>

<p>This one is interesting...coming from generating these resources to render out AMT I more or less viewed it as one code belonged in the coding - the AMT code which this Medication resource represents. I was swayed more by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191368">@Brett Esler</span>  wanting a use which was representing a Medication from an existing system's record of a patient, and it had a number of codes tagged against that record, which had intersecting but not equal meaning.</p>
<p>For my use case I'm not likely to want to provide translations as alternative codings on the Medication resource...but if I did (for example Brett's case) I'd want to indicate (if I knew from the system) how synonymous these other codes are to the "primary" code which carries the real meaning of the Medication resource. Something like the values from <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-concept-map-equivalence.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-concept-map-equivalence.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-concept-map-equivalence.html</a></p>
<p>I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> had said that there wasn't a need because the receiving system would interpret the codes it understood and have maps to understand how the codes relate. I guess I was hoping to capture what the sending system thought about the relationship between these codes and the Medication's meaning which may be different to my understanding as the receiving system with a map. That difference is all about the context of use of those codes, which only the sending system really knows...or maybe not!</p>

<p>I would strongly encourage everyone on this thread to help pharmacy work through the requirements.  We've made some changes to the medication resource but we need your help to make sure we understand your use cases.  We have an active project to look at the requirements for a potential new resource that we have tentatively called "MedicationKnowledge" and will be working with the BR&amp;R work group to help define.

<p>besides Defining a product, there is the notion of specifying a product like <br>
"here's a prescription for Tylenol, but be informed this is Paracetamol in case you need to know it"  <br>
(i think this is what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> is referring to), and in that case, yes, for example that is exactly what the Dutch do:</p>
<p>&lt;prescribedMedication&gt;<br>
&lt;MedicationKind&gt;<br>
&lt;code code="30597" codeSystem="2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.4.10" displayName="CHLOORAMFENICOL OOGZALF 10MG/G TUBE 5G" codeSystemName="G-Standaard PRK"&gt;<br>
&lt;translation code="15822" codeSystem="2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.4.1" displayName="CHLOORAMFENICOL OOGZALF 10MG/G"<br>
codeSystemName="G-Standaard GPK" /&gt;<br>
&lt;/code&gt;<br>
&lt;/MedicationKind&gt;</p>

<p>I think Lloyd's suggestion is valid: are the codes in medication itself or in the Prescription / administration...? <br>
In the example above, we put the different identifiers in the medication itself (which means "this medication, in this context, is defined by these two codes"). Is that the right way?</p>

<p>It's completely legitimate to send multiple codings using different code systems that may identify the concept at different levels of granularity - so what you're doing is totally legal.  The work group is exploring whether there's a more formal way of specifying this, such that the code for the manufactured drug would go in one place, the code for the generic formulation would go in another place, etc.  That way the receiver wouldn't necessarily have to recognize the code system to understand what level of specificity a given code was conveying - and we'd also have consistency with when we're trying to expose the same sort of information from a knowledge-base source.</p>

<p>Right, just a precision from the adjacent discussion so that we move forward<br>
"the code for the manufactured drug would go in one place, the code for the generic formulation would go in another place"<br>
should read <br>
"the code for one concept or granularity would go in one place, the code for another concept or granularity would go in another place"</p>

<p>right?<br>
i mean the a notion of "manufactured product" and "generic formulation" is not that clear, unambiguous or universal.</p>

<p>the requirements were exposed to Pharmacy some time ago, and they are more clear now in the Catalog discussions. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191759">@Melva Peters</span> the changes suggested  to Pharmacy implement the requirements. Glad to expose more requirements if that is useful.</p>
