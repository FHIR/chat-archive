<p>Hi all, who could help me with the following?<br>
Currently at Nictiz, we are using our capabilityStatements to only include the minimum requirements to comply with a Dutch heatlhcare informations standard. However we've become unsure as to what the minimum should include.<br>
Say we declare a certain profile needs to be supported, this profile will be represented in the capabilityStatement. However, the profiles used for referenced profiles are not part of the capabilityStatement. <br>
My question is, how far should we go with the minimum requirements stated in our Capability Statements? Should we include these referenced profiles as well? <br>
I am wondering if anyone has similar experience and use for the Capability Statements, who could offer advice what their course of action is.</p>

<p>I provide expectations on the "primary"  artifacts you are supposed to support -  in other words the CS points to a profile , operation or searchparameter definition that may contain extensions, and codesystems and valuesets which are not explicitly mentioned in the CS but need to be  implicitly supported.  I try to capture all the profile that are needed for transaction in the use case.</p>
