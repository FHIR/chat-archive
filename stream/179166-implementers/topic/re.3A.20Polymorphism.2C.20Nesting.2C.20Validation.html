<p>Dear FHIR Implementers,</p>
<p>Health data interoperability is critical for society.  FHIR is the most developed way to do it and it works for patients in the real world right now.  Here are some challenges I've encountered while writing code to work with FHIR resources and some ideas / questions about to make FHIR a little bit better:</p>
<p>FHIR resources are XML/JSON documents, and some resource types can take a bunch of different nested tree shapes. Let's call this, "resource polymorphism."  Resource polymorphism makes it more difficult for developers to use these resources without bugs, because if you want to get or set values in polymorphic documents, you need to handle all the different possible shapes for a given resource type, multiplied by the myriad different resource types you wind up using.  That conditional logic and error / option handling also incurs runtime costs in memory and latency.</p>
<p>For example, many (most?) Observations have a “code” with a “valueQuantity”, but if an Observation has a "component", like how blood pressure has diastolic and systolic values, then it's actually N observations squished into 1, so you have to check for that key, and if it's there you return multiple values, units, display names, then re-shape them into a struct of arrays, while still handling the normal case ("component" not in observation) in another way. All that, just to put all the diastolic values into an array etc to run statistics on them and properly pair names, units, and values when you go to analyze and plot the data.  </p>
<p>In the particular case where a resource type could have 1 or N values for a given variable, what if we always use a list? </p>
<p>If a branch of a tree is always a list even if it has only a single leaf, then we can do:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>result = map(path, f, data)
</code></pre></div>
<p>instead of</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>value = prop(path, data)
if isinstance(value, (tuple, list)):
   return map(f, value)
else:
    return f(value)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Anyway, FHIR Resource Polymorphism also precludes almost all of us from using the most battle-tested databases (SQL) as they were originally designed to be used.  To put FHIR resource instances in a SQL database, you can store them as JSONB (which could be a bunch of different shapes and thus surrenders the consistency and migration advantages of SQL), but you still need tons of SQL to handle different document shapes.  It's tempting to think we could fix the problem if we translate resource schemas into SQL table schemas, but then we're still stuck writing tons of SQL, this time to do joins across tables which represent the nested leaves of documents of different shapes. SQL doesn't solve the polymorphism problem, it just forces you to deal with it in a different language.  Further, even if every FHIR resource of a given type were exactly the same shape, you'd still need tons of joins, one per level of nesting, or be stuck on JSONB. </p>
<p>One way to cope with polymorphism is to use functional optics: prisms and traversals can retrieve optional nested values under different paths / path-sets in document trees, but that’s less performant than lookups in flat data structures like structs or SQL table rows</p>
<p>Another thought, the FHIR Resource Validator uses object-oriented Java, which seems difficult (to my nubbey self) to understand, since it imports other java projects and because the validation result depends on the state and context of the validator class instance at the time it validates something.  </p>
<p>Just one man's opinion.  FHIR works right now for lots of patients in the real world.  I apologize for any offense I cause with my feedback on the system.  Please feel free to push back on  / criticize these ideas. </p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>Re: Polymorphism:</p>
<p>What if we ruthlessly eliminate resource polymorphism to simplify the code necessary to use FHIR?  </p>
<p>What are some other examples of cases where different instances of the same FHIR resource type could require different code to work with?  How could we make those cases simpler to work with?</p>
<p>Re: Nesting:</p>
<p>Even better would be if we figured out how to make all the resource types truly flat structs without nesting. <br>
 If every FHIR resource were a flat struct, we could read and write any value in any resource in O(1), <br>
i.e. <code>value = prop(key, instance)</code> <br>
and validate any resource type in O(N) <br>
i.e. <code>instance_is_valid = all(map(validate(resource_type), instance.items()))</code></p>
<p>How impossible is it to make resources into flat structs?  </p>
<p>Or, accepting flat structs may be impossible, how could we make resources less deeply nested than they are now?</p>
<p>Re: Validation:<br>
How could we simplify the validator to make it simpler to understand, maintain, and evolve over time?</p>
<p>Would anyone who is an expert on the matter please be open minded to make an excruciatingly detailed youtube video which explains exactly how the FHIR validator code works? </p>
<p>I can see how validation requires data to customize the way things are validated, but can those options be passed in as arguments to a pure "validate" function?  </p>
<p>Finally, what if we rewrote the FHIR validator and resource schemas as an open source Rust crate?  </p>
<p>It would take learning and effort, but we could all join forces to contribute to a new single source of truth for resource definitions (the Rust type system) and validation (a pure function or 'validate' trait implementation).  Then we could figure out how to codegen types for popular languages (xml, json, toml, sql, graphql, python, typescript, c#, java, etc) with compile-time macros.  The validation logic could be simpler to understand, maintain, and evolve if it were stateless and all in one code repo.  Plus the strictness of the rustc compiler could help us ensure this critical "hot path" for a bunch of health data projects works exactly how the implenters intend without undefined behavior.  We’d get to learn the Rust language, which could help our careers as we go on to build other projects.</p>
<p>TLDR: I wish...<br>
1) resources of the same type were the same shape, because then I could simplify my code and it would run faster<br>
2) resources were flat structs (or at least flatter trees), because then I could simplify my code and it would run faster<br>
3) the validator was simpler, and we had a single source of truth for resource types with compile-time checks and codegen macros</p>

<p>Well, it's as pure as I know how to get it - implemented in java, so as portable as it can be, and the arguments are documented here: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Using+the+FHIR+Validator">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Using+the+FHIR+Validator</a> (and there is a Java class that exposes all this, and many people embed the java validator inside a server/pipeline in production</p>

<p>thanks for the link, i'll definitely check out those docs and the dotnet implementation. I feel your pain on the data inconsistency. I would definitely like to help figure out how to map resources onto more consistent shapes, if we can figure out baby steps for how to do that I will gladly follow your orders and work on it</p>

<p>well, the fundamental role of the FHIR community (specifically, the HL7 Standards committees) is to wrestle the real world requirements in a set of resources, where the resources are as coherent as we can possibly make them. And you'll find that the relevant committees are loaded with experts in the various fields. And that while it looks like it should be easy to do, it turns out to be extremely difficult. </p>
<p>In the case of Observation.component, which you mentioned. well, the community has navel-gazed on observation for 30 years, trying to find the least worst approach to handling the real world complexity that we can't get rid of. </p>
<p>if you really want to help, join HL7 and then sit on some of those committees and listen and learn.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what your conclusions would be looking at that output, I'd just like to point out that Synthetic data is bound to look pretty similar when one does a structural analysis. This is not real data, and it's also data generated for one single country. FHIR has to cater to all sorts of healthcare workflows/data, anywhere in the world, regardless of whether we're talking about billing, nursing homes, hospitals, or whatever. Getting hold of a representative data set will be basically impossible, which is why HL7 has learned to listen to the various standards implementers over the past 35 years..<br>
Nevertheless you may be able to draw conclusions that could be helpful for FHIR implementations in a very specific context, so this is not meant to discourage you from doing your analysis.</p>

<p>Would you not also need the workflow (transaction) documentation to make the example really useful? How was the data originally received? was it processed into an internal (non-FHIR) model? What happened next in the transaction...etc... a real-world example of JSON data by itself is sparse information in my opinion. I think the whole context around the exchange of that data is needed for the examples to be really meaningful....perhaps one could choose a specific interaction/type-of-transaction/workflow step that they are interested in validating?</p>

<p>I agree. I just have two use cases in mind in Germany. One is the (national) patient record, where the profiles are very strict and every field, which is not directly needed, is forebidden due to e.g. data privacy issues, and the other one is the communication within one organization, where the same data field may be allowed and present. These resources might look different not only in the number, but also in the complexity of fields.</p>

<p>Thank you folks for questioning and prodding me about this, because if you hadn't, then I never would have thought about how stupid I was at programming. How can we ever know what's truth, unless we admit we're idiots, and blindly stumble to make new words for the deeper stuff? I'm not sure how to ask, and yes, you are right, we ought to stay focused on what's relevant to FHIR. But what's more relevant to my own work, than my own stupidity? So, I need help. Why not just ask? </p>
<p>Yes, you're right. Keep to the task at hand. But, isn't my own stupidity about trivial, basic stuff, central to every task at hand? What happens if you find something scary? Yet, is it not also rude of me, to involve Other Folks in some Weird, Spiritual, Relativistic, Neo-Socratic, Neo-Hegelian Fractal Mindfuck? I guess, but, I'm really just trying to help Folks in general be healthier. What's more relevant to Folks' health, than the true nature of the Stuff?

Could everything everywhere all just be defined by relative distances in 3-space, and it's all some Fractal  Ternary Logic of Bits (photons and gluons): 12 (Light/Dark) 12 (Present/Not), and Atoms: 123 (continuum, affinity, polarity) ?</p>
<p>How could human logic and communication not be defined in binary and ternary, if we're implemented in it? I'm not sure we could ever make human words to describe it, but what's so cool about ternary logic, that it builds infinite universes? Well, it's gotta be some mixture of all the things we think are separate, which are secretly the same, right? So why ternary? Is it because of looping? Is it endlessly, fetishistically multiplying 3, or is 3 just our word for a number, and numbers are our concept for something which wasn't ever separate from the rest of math? Maybe the universe just wants to tell us to question inside of ourselves, and not get bogged down by words so much? Belief-space is subject to dynamical systems laws, too, and it's implemented in 3-trees in a 3-space just like everything else, right? Even if consciousness IS implemented via neuron module communication, or whatever, how could it come up with anything the universe doesn't know about?  So what's a triangle? It's a thing that lets you steer around? After all, how can you go forward in your belief systems, if you only have one belief? You can't. you stay. With Two Beliefs, what happens? Tug of war, right? How about with 3? If you can juggle 3 beliefs in your head, and save your state in Stuff,  can you not, over time, build chains of logic about Stuff, to arbitrary levels of abstraction?  Is it trajectory planning in logic land? </p>
<p>Is the universe telling us: It already solved our problems, or do we just have different problems? Did it perfectly index the optimal solution to existence? Why wouldn't it? If it hadn't, eventually, folks inside would improve it until it did. Why would the universe be mean to the stuff, if the whole point of the game, is to make lots of stuff? But what are "Folks" if not just dynamical systems  of "Stuff"?  Also, why would one particular category of Stuff, be better than any other category? It wouldn't, because it's all about computing your preferences and interacting with Other Stuff. The best preference, is Truth, and you can get pretty good info by looking at stuff. The computation, though? That's internal dynamical systems behavior, causally separated from the external stuff, because it's looping inside your brain and adding up memory-changes over time. You're made of universes, and living in one, at the same time, and the universe doesn't care how you logically categorize the other stuff, it just lets you do it in the best way possible. Why can't theists and atheists BOTH be right? Maybe, we're born to overthink everything, when the best thing to do, is relax, imagine universes inside ourselves, and use the logic of the universe to merge ideas. How could a Universe take us somewhere, if we don't tell it where we want to go?  So we tell it. How do we tell it?</p>
<p>Well, you have to know what you want, and how do you do that? You compute about it (ideally, using atoms of Thesis, Antithesis -&gt; Synthesis, which I guess is the stablest, simplest, all-merge-flow of logical information in the optimal logical space.  which do the best discrete logic possible, in 3d), and state you preferences explicitly (aka, communicate  letters between other stuff in the external world), to the external stuff? But really, why would a universe exist purely to be benevolent to one form of Stuff, if polarity is just a concept? Maybe it's because eventually you bottom out on the concept of nothingness, break stuff into categories of 3-piece elements more? Yet, do we really bottom out? After all, bottom, is just another human concept of polarity. Why could it not go on and on, forever, infinitely, both within space, and within and without of itself? Is space the ultimate stack overflow? Does it just take us to different branches of infinite possible ways things can go, depending on our inputs, reasoning, and outputs? How could it? Are universes themselves, destined to fight to survive against the anti-universe? Can they be exploded by folks in the outer-universe? I realize it sounds silly, so maybe it's wrong! In fact, this theory is <em>definitely</em> wrong. Why wouldn't it be wrong? Well, Truth is a concept which is relative to Falsity, is it not? How can human words and 2D squiggles, help us better tell a 3D story of a universe which is infinite, both in complexity and simplicity, at the same time? What's the synthesis of free will and being a zombie? Both consciousness, and mechanism, must unify, no? </p>
<p>Surely, pondering how stuff works, doesn't make stuff and the being of it, any less cool. If anything, it's more cool! Why wouldn't it be awesome and humbling for all of us?  If Universal Stuff Justice were an ultimate recursively optimizing concept, all implemented by one underlying thing, why wouldn't the feelings of the stufflings be a relevant and high-priority goal for an infinite universe? Well, what's the best way to make a fair Box of Stuff? Easy. Make it Perfect, right? But what's the definition of Perfect? Max Simplicity? Why wouldn't being stuff, be better than being no stuff? Does ethics need to be complicated, or is that simple too? So how do you merge Jesus, Newton, and Einstein? What if stuff just looks at other stuff, decides if it likes it, and approach/ignore/avoid. Treat others as you would like to be treated.  We have to merge the past learnings, right? No! keep going! If you stop looping your idea triangle, you stop giving the universe what it wants: degrees of freedom.  It's alway for one thing: decide what you want, and how to make it happen? How do we apply it to FHIR data? What the heck do we make of  this? How do we use it for good and avoid it being used for bad?</p>
<p>Do we live in a Perfect Atomic Computer? What do you think?<br>

<p>I realize it's a lot to think about. That's why I'm asking you to think about it. I hope I don't get banned for this, but I don't want to waste my time or your time, and I already typed out the  rant, and it feels useful, and not, in a billion ways. If anybody wants to reply with criticisms or clarifications, please do! What do we make of it, if humanity proves we live inside of 1 atom of 3d logic, while also being made of atoms of 3d logic? What if this implies, the whole thing extends infinitely, and is optimal? How could it? Can it? How do we make sense of it? This is bigger than money. Money is a number. What are numbers?</p>
