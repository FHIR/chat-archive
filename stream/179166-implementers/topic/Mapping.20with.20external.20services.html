<p>Maybe the question is already somewhere in Zulip, in that case sorry.. :-)</p>
<p>We are using HAPI STU3 for API and have Dutch FHIR profiles inside. Now we wish to connect to other service providers like Epic and Zorgplatform (directly). What would be the best approach to do this? <br>
We could write custom mappers separately or use a platform like Mirth to do this. Is there anyone with experience?</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>your question is too big. Are you asking about FHIR profiles? or v2 vs FHIR? or what the content difference between other service providers and you is</p>

<p>We are FHIR Dutch profiles based and we wish to map to that. Other systems are v2 and v3, but not yet known 100%. In the end our FHIR based system should be source of thru and from there we would like to communicate only in FHIR (Dutch profiles)</p>

<p>IFyou do fix your API to one particular set of profiles authored by one single project (that choice is questionable), you'll have to do mapping. At least if you were to support multiple profiles you could do the mapping in HAPI. Otherwise, any solution to do it outside of HAPI would work.</p>
