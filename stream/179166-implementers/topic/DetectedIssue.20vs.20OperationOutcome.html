<p>If I'm doing some sort of CDS operation and the input code is wrong or out of date -to me  that is a technical error but I think would still be reported using <em>DetectedIssue</em>.  The <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/detectedissue.html#bnr" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/detectedissue.html#bnr">DetectedIssues Boundaries</a> suggest is limited to clinical issues and to use <em>OperationOutcome</em> instead.  I think that some more clarity is the documentation needed here.   I had assumed  that  OO is constrained to a direct response to an interaction and not some other issue discovered downstream in the workflow.  ( for example I successfully post a resource ...yay...  and it is discovered later that it is using a deprecated code..drat!... )</p>

<p>DetectedIssue is something that's part of the patient's clinical record.  I wouldn't expect the fact you'd used an obsolete code to be captured in the patient record.</p>

<p>My use case is public health case reporting it and the determination of reportability and using trigger codes.   So (thinking out loud) I think that in a restful approach it would be OO to the post.   Reversing my earlier position.  thanks Lloyd</p>

<p>So if I have a <em>Communication</em> that I am sharing with clinical partners and I want to say "hey... the Sender sent this and it failed and here is why"  I would have a status of 'aborted'  and a .statusReason extension ( assuming R3) which could reference the OO resource.  (There are lots of overlap with <em>AuditEvent</em> here but is being used in a clinical context)</p>
