The stated scope of Patient is "Demographics and other administrative information about an individual or animal receiving care or other health-related services."<br>
what can we say - either solid or loose - about the use of the Patient resource across it's scope? Have we seen use in a veterinarian context? We're sure about the jurisdicational spread, yes? </p>

<p>Also interested in its use in the financial space and the clinical research/trials space and public health reporting.</p>

<p>We have a veterinary prototype using Patient (it also uses Practitioner, RelatedPerson, Person, Organization, and Medication).  It started off as an app modeling horse races, and uses data from the Kentucky Derby (they have 100+ years of veterinary and performance data).    I wouldn't exactly call it production ready, and we've never found another app to exchange veterinary data with via REST API; but the FHIR resources handled the internal data modeling just fine; and we were able to exchange data via database to our other FHIR compliant apps (i.e. we loaded up the horses from the Derby Demo into our ProviderDirectory demo).</p>

<p>I am working on case reporting right now. Never thought there was any issue with the Patient resource in this context.  Stuff like travel history and occupational data would go elsewhere anyway.</p>
