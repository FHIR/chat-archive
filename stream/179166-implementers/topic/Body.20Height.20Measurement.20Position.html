<p>I need to be able to record whether the subject was lying or standing when their height was measured.  Could I use <code>Observation.method</code> for this?  To me, looking thorugh the <code>observation-methods</code> value set, it seems like a poor match.  Should I be using an extension?</p>

<p>You should use <code>Observation.code</code> to identify that. <code>Observation.code</code> is a LOINC code list. The code <code>8306-3</code> is body height- lying, and code <code>8308-9</code> is body height-standing.</p>

<p>Also, for me because of the way we do things, it results in 3 almost identical profiles: Body Height, Body Height (Standing) and Body Height (Prone). <img alt=":unamused:" class="emoji" src="static/third/gemoji/images/emoji/unamused.png" title=":unamused:"> </p>

<p>I think it depends on how to define the "data modelling". In LOINC, there are multiple body height meansurement: lying, standing, post partum, preoperative, estimated, stated ........ In clinical environment, they  are different observation entities. The interperation of those observation entities and how those information can be grouped as "body height" are the job of a terminology server. I don't think we should fix the ontology issues in "data modelling".</p>

<p>Data modelling 101: one piece of data per data attribute =&gt; you need 2 attributes to say "Body Height (Standing)" (because you can also say "Body Height (Prone)"; it's simple maths (set theory).</p>

<p>And even if you're happy to make this compromise, I'm still stuffed because it means I have to translate the "Body Height" concept to a vague <code>Observation</code> instead of <code>Observation[category=vital-signs, code=8302-2]</code>.</p>

<p>if it was as obvious as you say, then there would be no pre-coordinated codes in LOINC. but it's not so simple. You think of it as 2 different attributes, but other people don't. </p>

<p>The translation of a pre-coordinated concept into a post-coordinate express is a terminology server's job. In this case,  FHIR resource only send a <code>Observation.code</code> of <code>8306-3</code>. And your terminology server needs to translate that to <code>body height - lying</code> === <code>body height</code>:<code>body position</code>=<code>body lying</code>. </p>

<p>I'm not doing an implementation.  I work for a national body in Australia and we're building FHIR profiles as examplars for the real implementers; I have to be able to encapsulate all that information as a data model.  Furthermore, I shouldn't have to write a terminology server which can do such translations.  That's really, really hard to do for all circumstances - remember I could be getting _any_ code from _any_ terminology.

<p>Besides, I'm not really suggesting that we necessarily mandate anything.

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191366">@Stephen Royce</span> , body height is only a small part of all the LOINC codes. if you force  <code>8306-3</code> and <code>8308-9</code> to be a post-coordinated expression, whant happen to other people ask the similar request? The whole <code>Observation.code</code> list would be messy up and every implementation needs to encode those exclusions. <br>
The current trend in HIT is to use clinical idea instead of "data elements" to express the information. So, when saying <code>part of toe skin</code>, you don't need to use three data fields <code>body site</code>=<code>toe</code>+<code>`region</code>=<code>partial</code>+<code>body structure</code>=<code>skin</code>. Using pre-coordinated code may be hard in some cases, but it shouldn't be a totally bad thing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, FHIR standard does not impact your data model. You still can use <code>position</code> as part of the body height measurement table. The only thing you need to do is to let your API knows to combine that into a single LOINC code while sending data and vice versa.</p>

<p>Well, I can only say that history in computer science has regularly found that such is in fact always a bad thing.  However, saying that, with a proper ontology, you eat your cake and have it too.  So using <code>part of toe skin</code> from SNOMED would be alraight because you can derive <code>toe</code>, <code>partial</code> and <code>skin</code>.   The problem comes when you don't have that ontology because you can't then query on <code>skin</code> only.  No-one has yet answered my question in relation to using LOINC codes like this: how would I find all observations where the measurement was taken with the patient lying down?  If the answer is something basically you can't, then we have a problem.</p>

<p>There are efforts to align models more closely with semantics. For LOINC codes covered by the Regenstrief-IHTSDO agreement, the LOINC code is provided with an equivalent SNOMED expression: if you have a classifier, you can identify all of the body height observations no matter how much data is pre- or post-coordinated. SOLOR envisions something similar but a bit more comprehensive. And CIMI endeavors to build models that keep those semantics in line. In the height example, two distinct CIMI models might exist, one allowing codes that eitheer precoordinate position or don't, and another that prohibits precoordination but allows a position data element. The two models would classify as the same concept. It's not clear to me how much the FHIR spec that comes out the other end would need to take all that into account (is that one profile or three?), or how, but it does seem significant.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191366">@Stephen Royce</span> FHIR will generally land on the side of the practical, not the theoretical.  Systems capture data using LOINC codes.  We will let them share data with those LOINC codes - whether it adheres to any particular good practice or not.  Implementation spaces are free to constrain what codes can be used and where, but should use caution about prescribing a theoretical ideal that invalidates or prevents the sharing of existing clinical data or forces change on existing systems without a clear benefit for those implementers being asked to make the change.</p>

<p>For body height only, there is a way to let you find out patient is lying down or standing. After received LOINC code, you are able to query LOINC to get the <code>component</code> of the concept. <code>8306-3 body height - lying</code> has the compoent of <code>Body height^lying</code>. <code>8308-9 body height - standing</code> has the compoent of <code>Body height^stadning</code>. They are both the child of <code>8302-2 body height</code> which has the compoent of <code>Body height</code>.</p>

<p>So CIMI's problem is exactly the one I'm facing, but for the sake of simplicity of implementation (by others who are all outside of my control) I'd like one profile, and I'd actually prefer 1 model at the logical level - I _really_ struggle to see why I should have to bring implementation concerns into my logical model!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192022">@Jeffrey Chen</span> Yeah, but what about weight measeurements, blood pressure measrements, etc., etc., etc.  I need a generic mechanism for identifying _any_ measurement where the position of the patient could be relevant.  This cannot be done on a case-by-case basis because then I'd have to keep an eagle-eye on the code system to watch out for any variation that might occur to a code that now implies that the patient was lying down and somehow add that to my system.  It's completely untenable.</p>

<p>You cannot build a perfect data model with too many exceptions. For body height, you have restricted to only three variations: height, heighti - lying, and height - standing. But, you already ignor lots of other combinations such as lying down with shoes on. And, you may still need to keep eye open for weight with winter cloth on or just sleepers. Even ANZ bank couldn't build the perfect data model to let them know which homeloan is for investment or own occupy. So, forcing FHIR to sute all data model is not possible.<br>
You can provide a proper data model with those variables you think is important. Then, let the implemetnator to figure out how to use a doable way to pass data between each system by using FHIR. Doesn't matter they encode those logic or use a terminology server. That is SEP (someelse's problem).</p>

<p>That's exactly what I'm trying to do.  I'm building my model to cover the variables we think are important - although we do have a generic name/value pair to cater for any confounding factor that a system might like to use - and I'm not trying to force FHIR itself to be any different that it already is.  I am however, trying to create a profile that implements my model.  The simple answer to that has already been identified: use an extension like HSPC.  The rest of the discussion has simply been me trying to point out that the continued use of pre-coordinated terms, while most probably very handy in the short term, carries a very high long term cost to digital health and that just maybe we should think about that.</p>

<p>So, like I already said, SNOMED, being a proper ontology, does not present a problem here.  LOINC, however, does.  Because, if I want to design queries that require knowledge about information implicit in a code, I simply cannot do it.  Not until, the codes are backed by an ontology.  If work to do that is underway, great.  But how long until it's complete?  And what am I supposed to do in the meantime?</p>

<p>FHIR is still in DSTU. <code>ValueSet.codeSystem</code> was in DSTU2 but has been removed from the current build. And lots of other stuff have been added and removed. How long can FHIR in final release mode? The answer is same as how long medical ontology can settle down: we don't know. The problem which you are facing is trying to adopt a standard which highly rely on terminology/code system, but also trying to avoid to fully use the terminology/code system.</p>

<p>Well exactly.  That's why I would like to, at least in Australia, provide some implementation guidance around best practice with respect to pre-coordinated codes that are not backed by an ontology, but it would seem that others don't see that there's any problem here that would require guidance or even accept what best practice actually is. <img alt=":disappointed:" class="emoji" src="static/third/gemoji/images/emoji/disappointed.png" title=":disappointed:"> </p>

<p>That's why the solution is for body height only. LOINC component character contains three parts of information. The first one is the principle name which is <code>body height</code> in this case. Then, there is an adjustment in the component character which is either <code>lying</code> or <code>standing</code>. One way to get the relationsihp information from LOINC is to analysis the componet, system, and method characters.</p>
