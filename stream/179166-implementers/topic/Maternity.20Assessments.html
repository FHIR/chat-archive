<p>Hi ,</p>
<p>I have been looking through FHIR site for an appropriate structure to capture various assessments related to maternity which are done during booking appointment. Examples - VTE assessment , Tissue Viability  etc.</p>
<p>So far , I have seen 2 structures that come close :<br>
Clinical Assessment : <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2015Jan/clinicalassessment.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/2015Jan/clinicalassessment.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/2015Jan/clinicalassessment.html</a><br>
Risk Assessment : <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/riskassessment.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/riskassessment.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/riskassessment.html</a></p>
<p>Am I in the right direction ? Also ,  I have seen a comment in Clinical Assessment link which says :</p>
<p>There is another related clinical concept often called an "assessment": assessment Tools such as Apgar (also known as "Assessment Scales"), and this is different to the scope of the "clinical assessment" resource. Assessment tools such as Apgar are represented as Observations, and Questionnaires may be used to help generate these.</p>
<p>Haven't found any link to "Assessment" mentioned above. I feel perhaps "Assessment" is the right structure since we are dealing with assessment scales like MEWS (Modified Early Warning Score or Modified Early Obstetric Warning Score). Is it possible to get a link to it or any guidance in this regard ?</p>
<p>Thanks ! </p>

<p>Most assessments that don't fit under the ClinicalAssessment or RiskAssessment will be captured through either Observation (or hierarchies of Observations) or DiagnosticReport.</p>

<p>Yes the MEWS is a clinical assessment tool and should be represented as a set of Observation Resources.  The scores for each parameter are recorded as an  Observation.  The total is another Observation that may reference each parameter.  See the <a href="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/observation-example-glasgow.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/observation-example-glasgow.html">GCS example</a>.</p>

<p>Or Questionnaire/QuestinnaireResponse if it is structured data capture using templates.</p>
