<p>Can someone help me with the way to differentiate between A01 and A08 while doing FHIR to HL7 Mapping .What are the deciding parameters as to which type of message should be created as an output?FHIR to HL7 Mapping</p>

<p>You might want to raise this on the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179188" href="/#narrow/stream/179188-v2-to-FHIR">#v2 to FHIR</a> stream</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192461">@Bipin Singh</span>  -- we usually map A01 to FHIR Patient and Encounter (and other like Location and Organization) in a Bundle.   We set the referenced (from Patient) Encounter.status property to 'in-progress' as a way to indicate it's an active encounter.  We use the PID (usually MRN) as the business identifier for the patient so that later on, when we send a Bundle for the A08, it can update the same Patient resource.    The A08 would also be mapped to a bundle with Patient, Encounter, etc. but the request.method set to "PUT" to allow the existing Patient resource to be updated.   (It depends on your A08 workflow but if the A08 also changes the patient location, e.g. in PV1, you might need to update the referenced Location and maybe Encounter resources.)    As usual though, one person's HL7 V2 mapping is just that, one person's mapping; your needs/requirements may vary (but hope this gives you an idea on one approach).</p>

<p>The question is FHIR to v2, not the other way around. A01 is 'new inpatient encounter', so that's what you'd have to monitor in FHIR (a state change of the Encounter resource). A08 is the "something has changed" trigger event, which shall only be used if none of the other 70-odd A?? events is suitable.</p>
