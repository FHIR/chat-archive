<p>For the following scenario as an example, is the DetectedIssue resource more appropriate than the Condition resource, or there's another better way of representing it per FHIR?</p>
<ul>
<li>An episode of Hypoglycemia <em>(a condition)</em> occurs <em>due to</em> the patient skipping a meal or high dose on insulin.</li>
<li>This episode/event is <em>supported by</em> some symptoms like Hunger, Headache, etc. and by the Blood Glucose observation.</li>
<li>Then the patient drinks a glass of juice - which <em>resolves</em> the event.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence we need to represent the Event, Evidence [Cause &amp; Symptoms] and Resolution.</p>
<p>Now, as you can imagine this can be represented by the condition resource IF, we add the custom component of how it was resolved to it.<br>
On the other hand, the DetectedIssue does already provide us the "mitigation" component, but the DetectedIssue code doesn't seem appropriate to capture such an event.</p>

<p>DetectedIssue represents a warning about a potential contraindication.  Condition is generally used for monitoring and tracking a long-term state.  A single episode of hypoglycemia would typically be captured as Observation.  However, if you're wanting to capture mitigating actions and resolution, you could also look to AdverseEvent.</p>
