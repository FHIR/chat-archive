<p>I'm looking for a summary of changes in R4 that lists some higher-level themes/patterns of changes. </p>
<p>I've seen <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/diff.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/diff.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/diff.html</a>, but this lists all changes in every resource. I'm kind of hoping for something that might give me a little higher level view. </p>
<p>I've also seen articles like this <a href="https://www.pocp.com/hit-version4-fhir" target="_blank" title="https://www.pocp.com/hit-version4-fhir">https://www.pocp.com/hit-version4-fhir</a>. But this is not very technical. I understand that R4 makes some parts of the spec normative, but looking for something that gives me a high-level understanding of changes, maybe with some reasoning behind changes.</p>

<p>There were thousands of changes - some minor, some major.  The rationale for each is reflected in the associated change requests but there isn't a summary of those that captures the rationale.  (By the time we get to the point of sumarizing what happened, the rationale doesn't really much matter anymore - the change is made and mandated.)  The volume of change is really too large to reasonably summarize changes at a technical level - the reality is that different implementers will care about different aspects, so your best bet really is to look at the changes for the resources you care about.  The only summaries we have are the high-level non-technical ones that were part of some of the product director blog posts and ballot intros.</p>
