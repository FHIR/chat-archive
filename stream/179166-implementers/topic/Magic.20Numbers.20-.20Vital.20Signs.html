<p>I'm a bit confused on the reasoning for magic numbers. </p>
<p>Are they to cope when multiple codes could be used such as 8352-7 - Clothing worn during measure, this also has the code of "29463-7" which is the magic number.</p>

<p>So if I was using SNOMED the magic number would be '27113001' and if a patient was wearing shoes the code would be 424927000 and also 27113001 as the magic number.</p>

<p>The "magic number" is the code mandated by the profile which provides interoperability across all systems, regardless of what other codes they might choose to send/care about.  We started using the term "magic number" with respect to the vital signs profiles to help certain stakeholders get over the fact that we were mandating the appearance of LOINC codes in all vital signs Observations.  The point was that it didn't matter that the chosen code was LOINC.  What mattered is that it was a single "magic" code that could be used to determine that something was a body temperature, a weight, a blood pressure, etc.  LOINC was chosen because of its relative widespread use and its free international availability.  It would certainly be possible for the UK to define an <em>additional</em> magic number if they wanted to mandate the use of a specific SNOMED code in addition to the LOINC code (perhaps for easy population of the LOINC code, possibly for other reasons).  But you'd still have to send the LOINC code defined by the international profiles.</p>

<p>Thanks, so my reasoning is incorrect but I was in effect, using a (SNOMED) magic number already. <br>
I presume we've included the LOINC codes for international compatibility but that doesn't alter the fact I need a terminology service or simple ConceptMap to convert to LOINC.</p>

<p>but that's an internal issue.</p>
