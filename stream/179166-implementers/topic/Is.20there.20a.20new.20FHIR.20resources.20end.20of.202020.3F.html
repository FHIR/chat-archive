<p>Wonder if there will be a new FHIR resources release end of 2020 or early 2021?  If so, what are the resource(s) impacted?  Is there a link to preview?  Pls advise, thanks.</p>

<p>the "preview" is always the latest build.  You can look at it by going to <a href="https://build.fhir.org" title="https://build.fhir.org">https://build.fhir.org</a> or by looking at the list of versions (a link to that can be found at the top of every page).</p>

<p>The timeline for FHIR R5 is not yet fixed, but right now it's looking likely to be mid-2021.  Most resources are likely to be impacted at least somewhat - though the resources that are normative in R4 will remain backward compatible.</p>

<p>Thanks Lloyd.  Are resourcesPractitioner going to be combined with resourcePractitionerRole in R5?  Will there be changes to resource Organization? CareTeam?  HealthcareServices?  Pls advise, thanks.</p>

<p>What's going to happen with Practitioner and PractitionerRole hasn't been landed yet.  We don't know all the changes yet - mid 2021 is over a year away.  You can look at the Jira change request log to see what's currently proposed and approved and the CI build to see what's been applied.  Note that it's also possible that some changes that have been made in the CI build could get rolled back before R5 too.</p>
