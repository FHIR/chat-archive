<p>Location.address is 0..1. In our model, we can have a physical address and also a postal address. It seems reasonable that a location can have a postal address too. Should the resource be made more lenient? Or should the postal address really run through the Organization resource?</p>

<p>Postal address is for the organization.  You don't send mail to a 'building'</p>

<p>We have had a lot of discussion recently (see <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-25375">FHIR#25375</a> and related trackers) about contact info (including addresses) for several related resources (e.g. Location, Organization).  There are locations that may have different addresses for the patient vs. shipping/delivery, etc.  I don't know that we've got a resolution yet.</p>
