<p>Is there a reason to not have contacts included for a Location?  For example one organization may manage multiple locations and the organization contact may not be appropriate for each Location.  We can handle it with an extension, but I was wondering if there was another best practice planned to handle this.  Thanks!</p>

<p>There is address and phone number information on Location.  If you're interested in contacts with specific roles, then you probably want the Organization that's tied 1..1 with the Location.  Locations have no responsibilities - they're just physical places.  As soon as you start talking about responsibility, you're into Organizational space.  You can have an Organization at the "per location" level even if it's not a distinct legal entity.</p>

<p>or use PractitionerRoles or HealthcareService resources (where the practitioner doesn't matter).</p>
