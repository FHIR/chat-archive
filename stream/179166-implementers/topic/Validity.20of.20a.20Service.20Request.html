<p>Next to an authoring date, and a date/period/frequency of execution, a Service Request in Belgium also has a period of validity. If for some reason, the service request cannot be executed within the period of validity, a new request should be made. Is there something that can be used for this situation?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="441371">@Bart Decuypere</span> Since the execution (aka fulfillment) of the request is tracked via a Task resource, Task.restriction.period seems to fit your need.</p>

<p>There are orders that are valid for a certain amount of time, independently on when/how they are being used here. For tracking the execution I could expect a Task, but for a "validUntil" date, I think this would be in the order itself, not a Task (which doesn't exist yet at the time the order is created).</p>
