<p>I have a document that has references from one Composition section to another.  I can't see in the guidance on Narrative on how to accomplish this.  There is a section on linking between Data and Narrative but that is between a Narrative and an element in a resource so I'm not sure if that would be the right way to link between section narratives.</p>

<p>You mean an existing CDA document?  I wasn't aware that was even possible...</p>

<p>it's actually an existing SPL document but I think the concept would be the same.  Each Section has an ID and you can use that ID to reference it from Section.text.</p>
