<p>How should we register the dispense of several products - with the explicit information that they were dispensed together?<br>
In other words, how would we group MedicationDispenses?</p>

<p>Typically when you're dealing with a "red pill in the morning, blue pill at night" sort of thing, the red and blue pills are dispensed in a single package and the dispense as at the combo-pack level.  I've never heard of a combined administration instruction that involved multiple drugs that weren't dispensed in a combo pack</p>

<p>But I just checked - we are currently grouping on the transaction. So it's a technical grouping, not a functional one. <br>
and TBH I see that we can functionally group dispenses per Procedure, but not by other events... whereas for prescriptions we do have a functional grouping</p>

<p>Hi Jose, that sounds a condition on dosing - I'm not sure how grouping of the dispenses helps to solve the use case since it is the patient that needs to know this.  We have an extension for conditional dosing, but I'm not sure it solves this use case at this point, but probably should.  Why don't you add a JIRA issue with your use case?</p>

<p>This requirement isn't specific to dispenses.  This is a dosage specification requirement so it applies anywhere that Dosage is used.  We do have a Conditional Dosing extension and you can sort of do this with that extension:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&lt;extension url=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/dosage-conditions&quot;&gt;
  &lt;extension url=&quot;whenTrigger&quot;&gt;
    &lt;extension url=&quot;offset&quot;&gt;
      &lt;valueDuration value=&quot;30&quot; unit=&quot;m&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
    &lt;extension url=&quot;trigger&quot;&gt;
       &lt;valueReference&gt;
          &lt;reference&gt;
              &lt;display value=&quot;after the red bill is taken&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;/reference&gt;
       &lt;/valueReference&gt;
     &lt;/extension&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>The only wrinkle is the representation of the MedAdmin, but I think using &lt;display&gt; is correct.</p>

<p>We probably want to update the extension (which is only draft at this point anyways) to have a choice of valueReference and valueString.  Then this would be perfect for your requirement (which would probably needed on the Request as well).</p>

<p>I question this - with our definition of dispense, I don't think that they are dispensed <em>as part of the procedure</em>.  They might be dispensed due to an order that occurred as part of the procedure, but we already have a data element for that.  Are we really saying that, while a procedure was occurring, the patient was dispensed medication?  I don't think we are.  If the dispense occurred in the same encounter as the procedure, then that is MedDispense.context.  If it occurred later due to an order made during the procedure, than that is authorizationPrescription (and the MedRequest then points to the procedure or the encounter).</p>
<p>That's why I questioned the use of this attribute at all in MedDispense.</p>

<p>That's not a dispense - that's an Administration.  A dispense is simply the supply of medication to a patient.  I think your example of samples given during a consult is a more appropriate use of the Procedure link.</p>

<p>My understanding of in-patient settings is that isn't a Dispense that would be recorded against the patient's record.  It's more akin to "shop supplies" used when your car is being fixed.  :)</p>

<p>Again, I think in-patient settings are different.  If you order an apple pie and the restaurant makes it from scratch, they don't record selling you "apples, flour, sugar, butter, etc.".  Similarly, I'm not sure that in-patient apps record all of the materials used during a procedure as dispenses.  I have limited exposure to in-patient pharmacy apps, but the in-patient care software didn't have those recorded as dispenses or supplies, only as administrations.</p>

<p>But your definition isn't the one we are using for the FHIR resource.  You can't use ISO or SKMT's definition if it is different than our current scope.

<p>This implementation was done several years ago. The results have been brought to IHE and ISO, but if HL7 prefers to keep its definition for medication dispense, that is fine.</p>

<p>Sorry, I'm not talking about the definition.  I'm talking about how the system this group of hospitals you mentioned records dispenses against a patient's record in in-patient settings.  We would definitely love to get more feedback from in-patient pharmacy systems.</p>

<p>My point is that a dispense is not an administration. They are different things. Maybe only 0,00020% of the hospitals support it, so I don't say FHIR must adopt that definition. For those that do, I'm sure they will find a way.</p>

<p>if you need to cut tablets in half to give to a patient, you will consume 2 tablets, dispense 3, and perhaps administer 1.</p>

<p>No one is arguing that a dispense is an administration.  Maybe you're missing my (and Melva's) point.</p>
<p>Use case: During a surgical procedure, a medication is administered to the patient (for anasthesia or contrast or some other reason).<br>
Result: <br>
a) A MedicationAdministration may be (should be?) recorded against the patient's record.<br>
b) A Medication Dispense may be recorded against the patient's record.</p>
<p>We have evidence from our existing implementers that (a) occurs.  We don't have evidence that (b) occurs.  If we can get evidence of (b), that would really help us understand the in-patient setting better.</p>

<p>Um, that "limitation" has been there from the beginning.<br>
Description: Indicates that a medication product is to be or has been dispensed for a named person/patient.<br>
Scope: This resource covers the supply of medications to a patient.</p>
<p>It's the same "limitation as the MedRequest, Administration, and Usage.</p>

<p>i don't read "for patient's record" there. Perhaps I was leading to confusion: <br>
When I say "not in the patient's record" I don't mean a dispense is not for a patient. By its very definition, the dispense IS for a patient. I mean it goes into the billing records or supply records. It has the patient name, but it is not for clinical record purposes.</p>

<p>In Norway’s largest Health care region we have worked on an implementation of MedicationDispense that I suspect could have some similarity to your implementation <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span>. The purpose of the implementation is both Inventory update/Stock management and ordering from hospital pharmacy. We also aim to support dispense through Automatic dispensing machine using the same API. We have had initial discussion with Touchpoint for a POC based on the MedicationDispense. <br>
All dispense are dose oriented, updating the dose status in the EMR. To complicate it even further we have a system that support ordering by generic medication (substance) where the product is selected either by nurse in a medicine room or at the pharmacy. The dispense for each dose is documented in the EMR, either as part of the nurse dispensing process or by pharmacy dispense (updating from the Pharamcy ERP). We have used the 2019 version of IPS Medication definition that have slice’s based on IDMP to support all variants of medication definitions.</p>
<p>Ordering from pharmacy would include standard medication and patient specific medication (typically cancer medication, infusion and pain relieve medication).  Defining the complex medications is extremely complex :), but achievable within the standard resource. Production/dispensing in hospital pharmacy would be automated or semi-automated in our Health region, depending on facility infrastructure.<br>
We have strictly limit the MedicationDispense to the process of supply medication and updating inventory. The process in the use case you mention where you administrating medication from a procedure tray, needs to be split in differnt processes. For a procedure tray, the medications are dispensed (by our definition) when the tray is ready/released for delivery at the pharmacy or is prepared in the medicine room. Administrating from a procedure tray is a separate process. There is no problem to include the procedure resourse in the dispense if you need to assosiate the dispense with a procedure. We evaluated a few use cases, but concluded to put it  out of scoop.</p>
