<p>Hey,<br>
i'm trying to integrate an attester in the immunization resource, in detail: a practitioner which is legal responsible for the content of the immunization resource. What is the best way for doing this? Extending the valueset    <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/immunization-function" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/immunization-function">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/immunization-function</a> by attesting Provider might be a solution, but is the one who is attesting really a performer? or should i create an extension for a attester like composition.attester?</p>
<p>regards Max</p>

<p>The Public Health WG has talked about this one already. We approved a change for R5 (notes are available at <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PHWG/gForge+tickets+15696+and+20327" target="_blank" title="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PHWG/gForge+tickets+15696+and+20327">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PHWG/gForge+tickets+15696+and+20327</a> - we approved Option B). I'm pretty sure I implemented this in current build already. But basically we allow a reference to a practitioner as the "information source". Not sure how this would be done in R4 or earlier versions.</p>

<p>I have no permission to enter your area in gforge, but do you mean the extension solution by " - we approved Option B" ?</p>

<p>Proposal B<br>
• Leave Immunization.primarySource as a Boolean to indicate if the content of the resource is based on firsthand knowledge of the immunization event<br>
  o Update the Definition<br>
     From: An indication that the content of    the record is   based on information from the person who administered the vaccine. This reflects the context under which the data was originally recorded.<br>
     To: Indicates if   this record was captured as a   secondary 'reported' record rather than as an original primary source-of-truth record.<br>
     The new description is copied from Event.reported[x]<br>
  o Cardinality remains at 0..1<br>
  o primarySource is    being kept separate so that even for a primary report, an “attester” can still be captured for a primary record<br>
• Rename reportOrigin to informationSource and enhance it   to have a   choice of data type<br>
  o The short description will be updated to read:<br>
     Indicates the source of a reported record<br>
  o The definition will be updated to read:<br>
     Typically the source of    the data when the report of    the immunization event is not based on information from the person who administered the vaccine.<br>

   Note that while some other resources don’t include Organization, it may be useful in Immunization if   the source of data is    a   school, pharmacy, other IIS, etc<br>
  o Cardinality remains at 0..1<br>
  o The name will be the same as MedicationStatement and is    broader than “asserter” given that a general code may be selected if   specific asserter information is    not available</p>

<p>Hey Craig,</p>
<p>just for information: i would like to refer to an attestor (for completness) even if primary Source is true , since the attestor is not necessarily a performer and i got no other options to refer to a practitioner.</p>
<p>Thanks Max</p>

<p>So starting in R5, you should be able to indicate the primarySource as True and still reference the provider in informationSourceReference. For R4 or other previous versions, maybe you just create an informationSourceReference extension.</p>
