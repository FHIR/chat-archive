<p>We've got several 'combined scores' that we're trying to model in FHIR; SNAQ, FLACC, MUST, STRONGkids, etc. All these assessments are based on multiple sub-assessments, which are combined into a final score.<br>
We're trying to model this in the same way as the Apgar score, which is a standard example on the Observation resource. The different sub-assessments are here mapped onto Observation.component, and the final score on Observation.valueQuantity.<br>
However, in order to do this, all the different .components need their own code from a code system. For Apgar there are loinc codes available for each of the parts, but this is not the case for all of these assessments. Does anybody know what's the best way to deal with this situation?</p>

<p>Best practice would be to define codes for the components</p>
