<p>anyone have examples of implementation for merging Patients and then using the Merged Patient.  In our case, we can have the same Patient enrolled under different IDs in the same organization, which need to be merged together once this duplicate patient has been identified.  I see FHIR provides the option to use .Link but I am not sure how people are using that in real implementations.  Or perhaps, there is just a copy of data from one patient record to the other, rather than just linking.</p>

<p>I'm very interested in this topic too. This is really tricky problem. We just think how to approach it. From one side - linking is good, but then you have to get all patient data by set of ids. If you copy from one patient to another - then potential <code>unmerge</code> will be nightmare.</p>

<p>Are you asking about actually performing the merge/unmerge using FHIR?  Or just representing the outcome of the merge using FHIR?  The FHIR spec currently doesn't support doing a merge (or unmerge).  Patient.link is only really the expression of a merge done via non-FHIR means.  Selecting surviving vs. non-surviving demographics, identifiers, etc. can't really be done without an event/operation.</p>
<p>Our implementation represents two merged patients in FHIR by just returning an HTTP 301 sending you to the target patient if you try to access the source patient.  Our resources that point to patient will all contain references to the target patient, but if any systems have old versions of resources with references to the source patient, that's fine, as they'll just get the 301 once they try to do reference resolution.</p>

<p>we've never run this into the ground. There's a choice of ways to implement it, which more or less match the choices in v2. I'd like to have a connectathon stream on this, but we've never got enough energy for that</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191764">@Cooper Thompson</span> in your case, how are clients instructing the API to perform the merge/unmerge that generates the redirect? Or, is the merge request handled out-of-band and presented to clients as a 301?</p>

<p>We are almost always going to be the EMPI for an organization, so we do not accept merge requests from API clients.  In the case where there is a 3rd party EMPI, we can accept merge messages via HL7v2.    We have not had a reason to implement a FHIR merge API with another EMPI, since HL7v2 serves perfectly well for that function.  </p>
<p>Academically, it might be interesting to talk about merges originating from FHIR (non-EMPI) clients, but operational HIM departments are unlikely to be on board with merges  coming from anything but the EMPI.</p>

<p>Hm... you could create a Provenance Resource pointing to all the Resources you copied from one Patient to the other, to make it traceable/reversable. Though I agree that it's a nightmare considering that in some scenarios, this could be hundreds of Resources...</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is one critical requirement of the IHE work item. Where we can, we will be defining an actor grouping behavior: Given a data server actor is grouped with a merge notification recipient, when it receives a merge notification from the authority, then it will give post-merge results to future requests for data, so that a client of the data server always gets accurate data query results.</p>

<p>Redox is attending in Montreal and we have implemented a FHIR patient merge using a message bundle with code <code>patient-link</code> and two patient resources, as well as handling the ramifications of that merge in our server. Would love to share our experiences before, during, and/or after the Connectathon! We're also participating in v2-to-FHIR mapping which might be somewhat related, at least in comparing a v2 patient merge with a FHIR message bundle.</p>

<p>So our system as an MPI, linking together patient records that are recognized to be the same person - this creates some questions on how best to render these linked patients in FHIR<br>
One option is to render each of them separately, and adding the links in the link element - but this makes getting all the clinical data for that patient somewhat difficult<br>
The other option is to merge them all together into a single FHIR resource - in this case though<br>
1) It might be useful to know that different elements came from different liked patients (corresponding to different data sources)<br>
2) What to do with conflicting data - like different birth dates?<br>
What we tentatively come up with are some extensions, so if a merged patient has two different names coming from different sources we tag them:</p>

Do anyone else have the same issue? How was it solved?
Is it worthwhile to standardize this (or a similar) extension system? Or maybe there is already something along those lines?

<p>Looks like you need to tag all the elements in Patient if values coming from different source: address, gender, contacts, ....<br>
Then the combined Patient json is hard to read.</p>

<p>Yes,we are tagging everything - tagging element with the source is a 'nice to have' though, not strictly needed. What is (probably) needed is to be able to put the original values in the output when they conflict and the element supports only a single value - like in the case of different birthdates</p>

<p>A client of the MPI is probably best served by having access to one single consolidated record. A client is unlikely to look or understand these extensions. If you wish to keep track (internally within the MPI) where some bits of data cam from, that'd be Provenance. If the MPI can't be sure as to what the birth date is, then the consolidated Patient resource should indicate there is uncertainty, not list multiple dates. (Just adding the client perspective, these extensions are a bit too focused on the MPI side).</p>

<p>I can see how I could add multiple Provenance resources pointing to the merged Patient to describe where the data came from, but it does not seem possible to indicate which piece of data come from which Provenance ... am I wrong?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> the Provenance resource should be indicating how to point to individual data elements within FHIR.</p>
<p>To flag something as uncertain you can put an extension on the relevant element.   (e.g. within the 'birthDate' element if birthDate is uncertain).</p>

<p>There is a CR asking for Provenance to express how to point at specific  data elements. I have passed this to FHIR-I for their guidance on 'how'.</p>

Our client wants us to document the ADT/ACK - Merge Patient - Patient Identifier List (Event A40). We can chose how to do this. </p>
<p>What is the best practice? - is this a concern of the audit event, provenance or  patient resource?</p>
<p>I'm also looking at this document: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PA/Merge+Operation">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PA/Merge+Operation</a></p>

<li>"Question: Provenance/AuditEvent actions - any security issues here?"</li>
<li>"Answer: After some discussion, the Provenance is the preferred resource to track this content, as will likely remain with the clinical data retention, AuditEvents may be cleansed periodically. AuditEvents are not always available/exposed to all users."</li>

<p>Can I consider this as official guidance?</p>

<p>I am not sure if your whole question is the one on the distinction between Provenance and AuditEvent... but if that is it, then I would answer that is the supported by the definitions in the FHIR core specification for those two resources, and covered on the FHIR core specification security and privacy pages <a href="http://build.fhir.org/secpriv-module.html">http://build.fhir.org/secpriv-module.html</a></p>

<p>That said... those are statements of intended use, and expected use under expected policy. FHIR does not declare any restrictions to ANY policy or use-case. We simply design to a set of expected use-cases. So you can certainly use FHIR in ways not consistent with intended use or expected policies.</p>

<p>I don't think there is any best practice for documenting patient merges yet. Personally, I think the Provenance resource is best suited for this but one could also imagine a solution utilizing Messaging. I would advice against using AuditEvents as these are not always supposed to be available to normal users whereas the Provenance resource is.</p>

<p>The changes one makes to a Patient (s) resource is a different topic than where to record why it was done (Provenance). There is an Implementation Guide from IHE that focuses on a Golden Patient domain. In this domain, which is a cooperative of many, there are one or more agents looking to detect failures that produced two Patient resources for the same single patient, and Merging. The changes done to the two Patient resources are defined. In that model only the deprecated Patient resource is changed. It is updated to point at the surviving Patient by way of its Patient.link with replaced-by; and it is marked as inactive in its Patient.active element. This following the guidance on the FHIR core Patient <a href="http://build.fhir.org/patient.html#dup-records">http://build.fhir.org/patient.html#dup-records</a>.<br>
AND all participants in the cooperative are informed of this merge with the expectation that THEY update their data, changing any data that references the deprecated Patient gets updated to point at the surviving Patient.<br>
Thus it is not just the Patient resource that is engaged, but also all the data holders under the influence of that Patient identity domain (golden).<br>

<p>There are other models that would update both the deprecated and the surviving Patient to cross-link them; but this overhead didn't solve any problem, and it presented some synchronization issues.  (Note one can always do a lookup given the Patient resource they have for any other Patients that have a link to it. This would find you all deprecated and thus merged former Patients)</p>
