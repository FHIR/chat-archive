<p>The include/revinclude spec says "If there is no reference, or no matching resource, the resource cannot be retrieved (e.g. on a different server), then the resource is omitted, and no error is returned."</p>
<p>Has there been any discussion of making Prefer:handling=strict turn this case into an error instead of an omission? It is somewhat different from the normal search parameter case since it is omitting extra data rather than changing how results are filtered, but it is still a case of giving the server input it cannot handle.</p>

<p>I don't recall any discussion, but we would generally say that the include is a convenience...</p>
