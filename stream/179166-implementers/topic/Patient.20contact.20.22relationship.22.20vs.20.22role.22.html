<p>I'm struggling with the ".relationship" element in the patient resource. To me there is a difference between "relationship" (e.g., sibling, parent, spouse, and the idea of a "role" (which is NOT an element in the contact field for patient), which in a serviceRequest context is usually alternate contact, emergency contact, or primary contact. </p>
<p>The role="Alternate Contact" could be a relationship="sibling, parent, etc..."</p>
<p>However, in the Patient resource there is just the "relationship" field and the data set is more along the lines just of "Alternate contact" "Billing contact", etc... even though description in the patient resource for the contact element is "A contact party (e.g. guardian, partner, friend) for the patient". I see these two approaches as something that needs to co-exist in separate data fields. Is there a standard way that this has been handled with the patient resource?</p>
