<p>Hi,  I have recently moved from PAS/EMM/EMR to the IVF industry. I'm working with various parties (including big Pharma) on integration between lab equipment, mobile devices, in-home devices, and IVF focussed EMRs.  Is there much progress in FHIR for support in this industry? I would be interested in joining and working group and promoting FHIR to my customers/contributing where I can ..</p>

<p>I would think that the base Observation, MedicationAdministration and Procedure resources would probably cover most of that space.  I don't recall seeing much in the way of IVF questions come through.  Are there particular areas you're worried wouldn't be well-covered?</p>
