<p>In our current logical model for Problem/Diagnosis (<code>Condition</code>) we have 2 elements for onset: Date of Onset and Age at Onset; and 2 element for abatement: Date of Resolution/Remission and Age at Resolution/Remission.  These are separate, optional elements, so, in theory you could have both date and age for <code>onset</code>, and date and age for <code>abatement</code>.  The <code>Condition</code> resource allows for just 1 of each.  I don't think it was ever our intention that a system would send both date <strong>and</strong> age for either <code>onset</code> or <code>abatement</code>, but I have to ask: can anyone think of a use case where having both would be important?</p>

<p>If you have the date already, then age should be a calculated value. Why do you want to save two piece of information and one could be incorrect?</p>

<p>I don't think we do, but our current logical model technically allows it.  I'm pretty sure that it was never our intention that you would ever actually use both at the same time, but it's not documented (<img alt=":unamused:" class="emoji" src="static/third/gemoji/images/emoji/unamused.png" title=":unamused:">), so now I have to make double sure that no use case for both exists. <img alt=":disappointed:" class="emoji" src="static/third/gemoji/images/emoji/disappointed.png" title=":disappointed:"></p>
