<p>We are trying to model a treatment instruction. A treatment instruction includes an agreed constraint in the treatment based on the oral or written living will of the patient. In this model, <a href="https://zibs.nl/wiki/BehandelAanwijzing(EN)" target="_blank" title="https://zibs.nl/wiki/BehandelAanwijzing(EN)">https://zibs.nl/wiki/BehandelAanwijzing(EN)</a> , our use case describes three concepts which are currently hard to place inside the Consent resource. (The Consent resource seems the most suitable resource for this, isn’t it? We know that the Advance Care Directive are not modelled completely)</p>
<p>The three concepts:<br>
Treatment – the medical procedure (Coding / CodeableConcept)<br>
TreatmentPermitted contains a valueset with three values: Yes, Yes but and No. (Coding / CodeableConcept)<br>
Constraints – mandatory if value for TreatmentPermitted = yes but. (String)</p>
<p>We thought of using .action for the treatment although it is not a perfect match. And the .exept something for the Constraints. Any thoughts on this modelling use-case are much appreciated!</p>

<p>We're currently modelling the treatment consent using the event workflow model but we're very early in the process. If you could put in a CV against the consent resource in gForge, we can look at this soon and see what we can do to help with your use case.  We're currently reworking the resource so this is a great time to make adjustments.</p>
