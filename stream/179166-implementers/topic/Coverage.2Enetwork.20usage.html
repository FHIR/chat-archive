<p>Hello,</p>
<p>The cardinality and datatype for <a href="http://Coverage.network">Coverage.network</a> is 0..1 &amp; 'string' respectively. Typically a plan and network have a many-to-many relationship. Also a network in itself has additional information like the identifier for the network, name etc. Also typically a member of a health plan when logging into the traditional health plan portal is shown a view of the providers who belong to his/her network, this can be using FHIR server if we know the network association correctly with respect to the specific member . Currently capturing this information against a member in the coverage resource is not entirely feasible because of the datatype and cardinality defined. Is there a reason why we keep the <a href="http://Coverage.network">Coverage.network</a> cardinality 0..1 and also the datatype as string. Can't we make this as datatype 'Reference' and and refer it to an Organization resource carrying the network information? Initially I thought of raising this in the C4BB stream but i thought it may be limited due to the constraints applied in the base resource in R4, hence raising it here to understand this better. Thanks.</p>
