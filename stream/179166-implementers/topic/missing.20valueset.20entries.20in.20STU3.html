<p>Hi, I am currently upversioning some resources from DSTU2 to STU3. I have found that the resource ReferralRequest had a 'Required' valueset in DSTU2 which is now different in STU3. <br>
Values such as 'accepted' and 'rejected' have been removed from the valueset in STU3. My question is how to we handle this? As it's a Required valueset, it is not possible to use a separate valueset for this element.</p>

<p>yes, this is a tough problem for inter version transforms  - sometimes the committee has made hard decisions like this; there's no general case solution</p>

<p>haev you looked at how the official R2/R3 mappings handle this?</p>

<p>Notions of "accepted", "rejected" and other codes that deal with tracking fulfillment have been moved to Task because they are separate from the status of the referral authorization.  It's possible that you might seek execution of the referral from multiple organizations and thus have a referral that's rejected by one organization subsequently accepted by another.</p>
