<p>We're just looking into supporting the Observation resource and note that the status value has a value-set. Within that value-set is a value with a different level i.e. corrected. How does this actually work in the context of the Observation resource? The profile says there is 1..1 status value but the Observation Status page suggests you can have more than one when a status code is a child of another.</p>
<p>&lt;Observation&gt;<br>
   &lt;status value="final" /&gt;<br>
  &lt;!-- status corrected - where would this go? --&gt;<br>
 ...<br>
&lt;/Observation&gt;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Where are you reading the suggestion you can have more than one status?  "corrected" is a specialization of "amended".  Both indicate that they are statuses that can come *after* final - so they're mutually exclusive with "final"</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> , thanks for the explanation. I guess I was trying to understand how to read the table specifying the corrected code - I hadn't seen a different level before. So a status may move from "final" to "amended" or "final" to  "amended" to "corrected"? Have I got that right?</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>There isn't a strict state machine, but yes, that would be the typical pattern</p>
