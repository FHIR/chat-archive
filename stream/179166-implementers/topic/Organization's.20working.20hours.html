<p>Hello! How can I define the working hours (hoursOfOperation) for a department (Organization Resource) within the healthcare provider profile? I know that the Location resource has an element "hoursOfOperation", but the Location is used to describe the physical level (not logical) of an organization. Please help me to clarify it.</p>

<p>PractitionerRole has an availabileTime.  You'd have a distinct PractitionerRole for each organization they work for.  You can do distinct PractitionerRoles for each department if you wish.</p>

<p>HealthcareService, Location and PractitionerRole all have that concept, organization doesn't. So depends which one you're after.</p>

<p>It looks strange, don't you think? To set the working hours of the department I need to use a distinct PractitionerRole (fake role)... Could you answer why an organization resource doesn't have it in a core element list? Please clarify the reason or correct me in my understanding of the use case. Is it an unreal case to provide working hours for a department (as a logical structure item of medical practice)?</p>

<p>The location has the hours there.</p>

<p>Sorry, I had missed that you wanted the hours of the department, not the hours of a provider within the department.  I think what you want is HealthcareService - that allows you to capture hours at a location offered by a particular organization.</p>
