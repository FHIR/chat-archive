<p>I am posting this on behalf of InterOPEN in the UK.  </p>
<p>On our weekly curation call we have been asked where in FHIR particularly the Encounter profile a Team or Group of practitioners that would be involved in a patient's care in Community and Multi-displinary team use cases.  How would this be represented in DSTU2.  </p>
<p>We have looked at adding a team extension using the group resource.</p>
<p>There is also a care team in the reference from Encounter to EpisodeOfCare.</p>
<p>It is also noted in DSTU3 there is a CareTeam resource.  But for now we are working with DSTU2 until tooling is avialable to support DSTU3 (particularly from Furore).</p>
<p>What is the best practice in this case?</p>
<p>Look forward to your thoughts and guidance.<br>
Will Jones</p>

<p>Do you mean Encounter.participant? It sounds like you're talking about CarePlan.participants though </p>

<p>CareTeam was extracted from CarePlan in DSTU2.  So in DSTU2 you'd use a CarePlan with no activities</p>

<p>In Argonaut we created the <a href="http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/StructureDefinition-argo-careteam.html" target="_blank" title="http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/StructureDefinition-argo-careteam.html">CareTeam profile</a> for DSTU2 using CarePlan.</p>
