<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Just wondering how the Condition.verificationStatus &amp; Condition.evidence is used in the following scenario:</p>
<p>Patient is waiting for a blood-test that confirms the condition and we want to capture that this evidence is what changes the status of the condition to "confirmed". </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Joel</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193795">@Joel Francis</span>  In general, yes, you can use Condition.verificationStatus to reflect the condition has been confirmed -- and you can use Condition.evidence to reference the <strong>results</strong> of the blood test as the basis for confirming the condition.  Are you just looking for confirmation (no pun intended!) that these are the correct elements to use or is there another underlying question (such as a more specific association between verificationStatus and evidence)?</p>

<p>I can run it by Patient Care work group, but I don't think you should reference the <strong>order</strong> for the blood test - before the results are in - as evidence that this condition has been confirmed.  Confirmation of the condition happens after the results/reports are available.  However, in re-reading the definition of Condition.evidence, we may need to revisit whether the evidence can be for suspected/confirmed conditions as well as refuted conditions (as well as orders/requests to get evidence).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191403">@Michelle (Moseman) Miller</span> , yes, i was gearing towards asking if there was a more specific association between verificationStatus and evidence. Would it benefit us all to have it part of the base resource? I would not reference the order but only reference it if it were the contributing factor for the "confirmation" of the condition. It seems logical to associate this evidence with the status. Will await your thoughts on this.</p>

Note:  Patient Care work group didn't think we needed to correlate a single evidence code/reference with verificationStatus.  It isn't in the 80% of what most systems support</p>
