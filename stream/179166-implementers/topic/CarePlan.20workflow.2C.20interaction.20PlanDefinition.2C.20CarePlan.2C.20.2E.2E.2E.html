<p>Hi. I'm working on a FHIR compliant "CarePlan-Workflow". The more I read the more questions pop up.</p>
<p>What I want to do:<br>
We have a care program with different care sections (I would use resource PlanDefinition for each care section).<br>
Then applying the PlanDefinition for the Patient.<br>
An practitioner should see (e.g. in a workflow panel) which parts (ServiceRequests) of the CarePlan(?) are done and which are pending or cancelled.<br>
In addition part of the ServiceRequests are grouped: e.g.<br>
 Request "record vital data" <br>
    |_SubRequest1 "pulse"<br>
    |_SubRequest2 "blood pressure" </p>
<p>Request "do basis assessments" <br>
    |_SubRequest1 "do Questionnaire 1"<br>
    |_SubRequest2 "do Questionnaire 5" </p>
<p>When a CarePlan is initialised there should be the possibility for the Practitioner to add additional custom ServiceRequests(?).</p>
<p>My approach:</p>
<p>Initialising a CarePlan from a PlanDefinition with ServiceRequests referenced in <code>CarePlan.activity.reference</code>.<br>
The ServiceRequest hierarchy is represented by referencing the parent-Servicerequest in child-<code>ServiceRequest.basedOn</code>, because their status should be independent from parent Request and other child Requests (as statet in <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/request.html#basedon">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/request.html#basedon</a> and <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/request.html#requestgroup">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/request.html#requestgroup</a>).<br>
When doing an Observation/Condition/Questionnaire (event object) in context of a ServiceRequest the events reference that in <code>.basedOn</code>.<br>
For sake of simplicity I want to avoid using the Task resource.</p>
<p>The problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>"User-visible" information about an action is just present in the Resources PlanDefinition and RequestGroup (description, title, prefix...), so CarePlan seems not to be the right option to display the care program to the user, and it seems this is the same case for ServiceRequest (the only field that really describes it, is <code>.code.display</code>)</li>
<li>CarePlan cannot represent the action hierarchy in contrast to PlanDefinition and RequestGroup. But RequestGroup seems not to be the right Resource to use, because it is stated that</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"[RequestGroup] represent a group of optional activities" and "The RequestGroup and all of its referenced "option" Requests are treated as a single integrated Request whose status is the status of the RequestGroup. If there is a need to manage statuses of the different parts, separately, refer to the guidance <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/request.html#compound">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/request.html#compound</a>."</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>If it is necessary to get the user-visible information from the PlanDefinition I may have a problem if I add custom ServiceRequests to the CarePlan after applying the PlanDefinition</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm a bit stuck at the moment modeling my use-case in the right way.</p>

<p>Certainly that would be a capability providers &amp; patients will want - protocols are rarely exhaustive and what you do in the real world will require modifications.</p>
<p>Not sure what you mean by issue #1<br>
#2 - Care-plan is intended to be a relatively simple structure.  If you want to establish a hierarchy among the different actions in a plan, you'll need to use extensions to link them that way.  Same if you want to assert temporal or other dependencies<br>
#3 - All information should be propagated to the generated resources.  You should presume that people looking at a ServiceRequest might not have access to the PlanDefinition/ActivityDefinition.</p>

<p>Think that goes with #3.<br>
<code>PlanDefinition</code> and <code>RequestGroup</code> establish a hierarchy and have fields like <code>textequivalent</code>, <code> prefix</code>, <code>title</code> described as e.g. "user-visible text".  I don't have these information on a ServiceRequest when I want it to present to an user - as you said: All information should be propagated to the generated resources.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>My intention was rather to get a hint if I'm on the wrong path. I don't want to violate the <code>CarePlan</code> resource if not necessary.<br>
Is it a better way in this context  to apply a <code>PlanDefinition</code> without creating a <code>CarePlan</code>, but rather only use <code>RequestGroup</code> ?</p>
<p>I'm working on a project in german healthcare. Are there reflections about depicting such workflows in the german context? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191450">@Simone Heckmann</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191436">@Stefan Lang</span></p>

<p>You can certainly use RequesatGroup - but a RequestGroup means that the collection has a single status and must be manipulated as a whole.  I.e. you can't suspend or cancel a part without suspending/cancelling the whole thing.</p>
