<p>Looking for more perspective on the pros and cons of Azure FHIR Server vs HAPI FHIR. I found a few articles online but they are from 2 years ago. Would love to hear people's experience with the two implementations. Any advice\insight is welcome. I am sure other people had to make similar considerations for their projects. Thank you!</p>

<p>Do you want to control your environment? Choice of Database, choice of where to run ... then you'll probably want HAPI. If you don't have any developers to write custom code and maintain the environment, then you'll probably want Azure.</p>

<p>I would not make a decision based only on that criteria...that it be too easy. Instead, I would look at the maturity of the products, the features and resources they support, roadmap, support, pricing, maintenance, integration (for instance, currently Azure FHIR API can be integrated with Azure AD) and so on...., on the other hand the MSFT-Team provides also the FHIR server on github where developer can enhance the code and provide other / more features.</p>

<p>Indeed, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server">https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server</a> can run anywhere (not just Azure -- e.g. see <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/tree/main/release">this docker-compose config</a> for a self-contained local server) and supports a "pluggable persistence provider" for database adapters.</p>

<p>This response is probably in convergence with the above responses but based on experience, I also think "business use case" also matters.<br>
For example, different cloud providers (google, MS, Amazon) have different goals for the use of FHIR. <br>
Depending on the goals of those cloud providers, there are limitations on how you can use FHIR services I think.<br>
Microsoft Azure is trying to build the ecosystem with FHIR server at the center but there are limitations on querying ability.</p>

<p>Like how <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="335936">@Daniel Venton</span> mentioned, if you need precise orchestration of the server then HAPI is the way to go. Azure OSS is also limited in programming language as well.</p>

<p>First up, for an apples-to-apple compare managed with managed and open source with open source (OSS)</p>
<ul>
<li>Managed: Azure API for FHIR vs SmileCDR (their managed offering)</li>
<li>OSS: Microsoft FHIR Server vs HAPI-FHIR</li>
</ul>
<p>Managed vs Open Source</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don't have an ops team that can run, manage, patch and upgrade a FHIR server, go managed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations for both Azure API for FHIR (Managed) and Microsoft FHIR Server (OSS)</p>
<ul>
<li>SMART on FHIR support hacked on top of Active Directory (AD). Briefly, you need to use a SMART on FHIR proxy. You'll be missing some features like standalone launch and (I think) a patient/encounter picker. And Role Definitions apply to all data on the server <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/blob/main/docs/Roles.md">link</a></li>
<li>No FHIR subscriptions. <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Azure.20FHIR.20API.20and.20FHIR.20Subscriptions">link</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations of Azure API for FHIR (Managed)</p>
<ul>
<li>No reading from the CosmosDB database; you have to $export or rely on REST API queries. Could be a deal-breaker if you need real-time analytics.</li>
<li>No FHIR façade to an existing database. Could be a deal breaker if you have want to expose data in an existing DB or need to keep the FHIR server DB in sync with another DB.</li>
<li>Must use Active Directory (AD) for authorization</li>
<li>Vendor locked to Azure (erm...the price we pay)</li>
<li>No Transaction Bundles (fine...because you probably don't need them) <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Microsoft.20FHIR.20server">link</a></li>
<li>No bringing your own DB (fair enough...the cost of being managed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations for Microsoft FHIR Server (OSS)</p>
<ul>
<li>Must create your own resource application registration. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/azure-api-for-fhir/fhir-app-registration">link</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations for SmileCDR (Managed)</p>
<ul>
<li>No transparent pricing. Talk to sales.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations for HAPI FHIR</p>
<ul>
<li>No SMART on FHIR server. You'll have to bring your own, which is a PITA because all of the open-source options have issues. <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/SMART+on+FHIR+server+implementations">link</a></li>
<li>Requires a ton of configuration, care and feeding for enterprise use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Neutral</p>
<ul>
<li>HAPI/SmileCDR: Java</li>
<li>Microsoft/Azure: .NET</li>
</ul>
<p>Advantage of Azure API for FHIR</p>
<ul>
<li>Easiest path to an enterprise-grade FHIR server for Azure users</li>
</ul>
<p>Advantage of SmileCDR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Batteries included</li>
<li>They have a fully featured SMART on FHIR Authorization Server, Remote Terminology Services, support for subscriptions, native conversion of HLv2 [^1], native real-time CDA conversions (beta), 3rd party app management (beta). If SmileCDR doesn't have it, it's highly unlikely that Azure does.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advantage of Microsoft FHIR server </p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to get started</li>
<li>Glide path to or from managed</li>
</ul>
<p>Advantage of HAPI FHIR: </p>
<ul>
<li>Easiest to get started</li>
</ul>
<p>[^1] Yes, Microsoft has an open source converter but it's not native and in a different "class" than the SmileCDR solution. <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter">link</a></p>
