<p>I am generating condition resources based on a local database which holds the patients' data. The rows in the local database have DRG and ICD10 codes at the same time (i.e., two different columns). For the DRG code there is also another column which holds the severity but for the ICD10 no column for the severity. Is that meaningful/allowed to generated two conditions for each row, so that one condition with DRG code having severity and the other condition with ICD10 code without severity element?</p>

<p>Better is to have a single Condition and put two translations on the Condition.code and also populate the severity.  It's common for some code systems to pre-coordinate concepts and other models to break them out.  It's still the same Condition.  There's a possibility of saying something that's inconsistent, but that's not really something we can avoid.</p>

<p>So, if I put two codes in the <code>Condition.code</code> and populate the <code>Condition.severity</code>, then how can other people know that to which <code>Condition.code</code> (between the two) does the <code>Condition.severity</code> belong to?</p>

<p>The severity doesn't belong to a Condition.code, it belongs to a Condition.  If you have a Condition with severity 'severe' and a code.coding that says 'rash' and another code that says 'severe rash', it's clear what's going on.  There is no specific association of the severity with one coding vs. the other.</p>
