<p>Hello,</p>

<h4><a href="https://chat.fhir.org#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Pre%20registration/near/153970984" class="zl"><img src="https://fhir.github.io/chat-archive/assets/img/zulip.svg" alt="view this post on Zulip" style="width:20px;height:20px;"></a> Bettina Lieske <a href="https://fhir.github.io/chat-archive/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Pre.20registration.html#153970984">(Jun 21 2018 at 14:55)</a>:</h4>
<p>We would like to model a pre-registration of a patient where a preliminary (non validated) patient record is created and a set of other resources like</p>
<ul>
<li>Appointment</li>
<li>Planned encounter</li>
<li>Preliminary diagnoses</li>
<li>Planned healthcare services, procedures</li>
<li>etc. would need to be created.</li>
</ul>
<p>We were wondering how to implement this in the best standardized way? Is there any implementation guide for this type of use case?</p>
<p>We also have some very specific questions: <br>
1) How can we model a "pre registration patient"? Through the status active = false (this does not really fit as the record is not “entered in error” as described in the documentation. <br>
2) How to model the pre registration encounter? Class = PRE REG, and status = planned? It seems that there are some dependencies between these 2 elements. Are they specified somewhere?</p>

<p>In your use case, the Encounter.status would definitely be "planned". Encounter.class depends on what you are planning for (could be anything: inpatient, ambulatory, virtual...<br>
I don't think these two are interdependent, except perhaps in so far as "planned emergencies" are rather unlikely to happen...</p>
