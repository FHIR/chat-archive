<p>Hi all, is there a good way to represent a household, family, neighbourhood and/or community? I have 2 use cases where a household is being tracked. Wondering if it makes sense to categorize them in a Group resource. Organization and then specifying a type seems like it could also work. Otherwise I'll just create a web of Patients and RelatedPerson resources.  For Neighbourhood and Community I think Location could make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Are you representing the population or the geographic boundaries?</p>

<p>Typically it would be Group.  A Group is a collection that cannot take collective action or have collective responsibility.  An Organization can take collective action and have responsibility.</p>

<p>In this scenario, assuming there is a head of the household and all other patients (members of the household) are effectively organised underneath them (e.g. I search for a patient by a mobile number and I return all of the household members), what would be the best way to model that? Would it require an extension on the Patient resource? Thanks<br>

<p>For what purpose?  Are you looking for who's covered by insurance?  Who resides in the same building?  The same apartment?</p>

<p>In some LMICs insurance is covered by who is in the household, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="315122">@Fred Hersch</span> is that use case here?</p>

<p>If you're talking about insurance, then you'd be querying based on the Coverage resource.  The head of household would be the 'member' and the family members would be beneficiaries.</p>

<p>Quite common in an LMIC community health setting ..e.g a community health worker performing household visits. A specific one is for a population health registry. You want to register all members of the household and nominate a specific member as the 'head of household'</p>

<p>Hmm.  There's an ability to link RelatedPerson to a corresponding Patient resource - in theory you could traverse that to get a full set of Patient instances tied to a particular head of household.  The other option would be using Group.  If you're getting into neighborhood or community, Group is really your only option.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> Would it be feasible to use (or extend) the Group.managingEntity(Patient) to refer to the Head of the Household? I think this is primarily used for defining who is responsible for managing the entity .. and should probably be the Practitioner .. But there would be a CareTeam to Group reference to capture this latter relationship.</p>

<p>I think if you want to flag one of the group members as having some special significance, an extension is probably best.  managingEntity is who's responsible for maintaining the group - which I'm assuming typically wouldn't be the head-of-household.</p>
