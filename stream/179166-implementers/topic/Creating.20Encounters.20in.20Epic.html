<p>Hi all. I am aiming to add Observations (flowsheet entries) to Patient records in epic using a "backend" service client registration. We currently have no natural open Encounter to reference in that Observation.</p>
<p>Is there a programatic way to open an Encounter in Epic? Alternatively, can I enter Observations (flowsheets) without an open Encounter? [My understanding here is "no" and "no", but I am hoping I have overlooked something.]</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>We have some options for either finding an existing, or creating a new encounter using non-FHIR methods.  Do you have a Epic TS you can work with to review options?  Depending on what type of flowsheet data, there can be different solutions.  For example, patient-entered flowsheets, or flowsheet data collected from a patient device can file to episodes rather than encounters.  For clinical data in flowsheets, you'll probably want to match to an existing encounter, as one should be open already if there is a system collecting clinical data in-clinic (or hospital).  For risk scores, we have other options.</p>
