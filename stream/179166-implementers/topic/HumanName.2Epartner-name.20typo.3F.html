<p>Hi, I think the documentation comment for HumanName.partner-name has a typo ?</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extension-humanname-partner-name.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extension-humanname-partner-name.html">HumanName.partner-name</a></strong> the comment states: "If the person's surname has legally changed to become (or incorporate) the surname of the person's partner or spouse, this is the <strong>person's surname immediately prior to such change. Often this is the person's "maiden name"</strong></p>
<p>Is this meant to read, "the person's surname immediately after such change"</p>
<p>As, the other extension, <strong><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extension-humanname-own-name.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extension-humanname-own-name.html">HumanName.own-name</a></strong>, also reads with the same comment "If the person's surname has legally changed to become (or incorporate) the surname of the person's partner or spouse, this is the person's surname immediately prior to such change. Often this is the person's "maiden name"."</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I'd agree, or may be just part of the new person's combined surname. In The Netherlands, all are allowed:</p>
<p>own-partner<br>
partner-own<br>
own<br>
partner</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Often this is the person's "maiden name"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure this part is true. The partner-name might be the maiden name of the partner, surely not of the person assuming the partner name.</p>
<p>A ticket for this is in order (<a href="https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/" target="_blank" title="https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/">https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/</a>)</p>

<p>I think it's just a copy paste error. I don't think that the paragraph is useful at all, in either extension. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="201366">@Gregory Schmidt</span> would you like to make a task to correct it?</p>
