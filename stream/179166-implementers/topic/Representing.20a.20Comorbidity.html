<p>I am trying to represent a patient having a comorbidity, and I need some input. Here's the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comorbid conditions represent categories of conditions</li>
<li>The definition of these categories <em>depend on the primary disease of interest</em>. For example, a CDCCovid19UnderlyingNeurologicCondition is not the same as a ElixhauserNeurologicComorbidCondition or a CharlsonNeurologicComorbidCondition. </li>
<li>It is sometimes possible to represent those categories in terms of value sets, although in general there might be other criteria (such as grade or stage)</li>
<li>The determination that a patient has or does not have an underlying comorbid condition is derived information</li>
<li>If the patient has a comorbidity, the practitioner probably want to know what in particular it is</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these considerations, I see two possible approaches:</p>
<p>1) Define a profile for each comorbid condition, for example, ElixhauserNeurologicComorbidCondition (there would be a different profile for CDCCovid19UnderlyingNeurologicCondition, since these entail different value sets).  </p>
<p>* Should the profiles be based on Condition? If so, where would I capture that this is a comorbid condition according to the Elixhauser definition (noting that the name of a profile is not meaningful)? What Condition.code should be used?  <br>
  * Or, should the profile be based on Observation, with the (TBD) code representing "Elixhauser neurologic comorbid condition", and the value being yes/no/unknown?</p>
<p>2) Define a questionnaire for the comorbid condition(s) of interest, and create pre-population algorithms, maybe in CQL, for each question. The answers in QuestionnaireResponse would be yes/no/unknown.</p>
<p>In simple terms, is a comorbid condition a Condition, or are we talking about membership in a cohort defined in some semi-arbitrary way?</p>

<p>Based on the Patient Care discussion today, we concluded:</p>
<ul>
<li>QuestionnaireResponse is the preferred option since comorbidities are often point in time and context-specific</li>
<li>Observation is a valid consideration -- provided we work through the details of how best to relate the conditions to the observation (Observation.focus was considered, but didn't quite cover the semantics of the relationship where condition A is a comorbidity of condition B).  </li>
<li>Condition is not recommended (since the comorbidities are point in time and context-specific)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm curious as to why Observation.focus doesn't capture the semantics?   Based on the description, what is being captured is not an actual linkage between discrete Condition resources. Instead, this is capturing an observation as to whether a specific Condition has comorbidities of categories of a condition(s).     As such, the code of the Observation should indicate that it is a Comorbid Condition Observation with a focus on the Condition it is capturing the Observation for along with one or more components that represent the class of comorbid condition (Observation.component.code) with the value indicating the yes/no/unk status.</p>

<p>focus is "what is specifically being observed in making the finding".  E.g. a specimen, a fetus, etc.  If you're capturing a co-morbidity, you're not "observing" the other diagnosis in making that finding.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/observation-definitions.html#Observation.focus">definition of Observation.focus</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The focus of an observation could also be an existing condition, an intervention, the subject's diet, another observation of the subject, or a body structure such as tumor or implanted device.</p>

<p>Seems to fit quite well.</p>

<p>Here's what I captured from the PC meeting yesterday:<br>
The consensus was that it does not make sense to either create a new Condition to represent a comorbidity, nor label an existing Condition as a comorbidity (via category or meta.profile). Stephen Chu made the point that comorbidities are point-in-time and context-specific assessments (e.g., comorbids are different if the admit diagnosis is diabetic ketoacidosis versus heart failure). They suggest looking at either an Observation, List, or QuestionnaireResponse as possible representations.<br>
•   The concern about Observation was twofold: (1) finding the right Observation.code (almost surely does not exist), and (2) linking the Observation to the Conditions or problem list items (we discussed the possibility of using Observation.focus).  NOTE: If we use Observation, the individual comorbidities could be separate Observations or components of one Observation.<br>
•   The concern about Questionnaire response is the ability to find and use the information (being "trapped" in the QR). My concern is having the yes/no criteria "buried" in some prepopulation algorithm.<br>
•   List was suggested by analogy to Problem list, this could be a comorbidity list. The problem is that List.entry needs to point to another Resource, then the question still, is that item an Observation? the original Condition?<br>
In summary, we made some progress but there are numerous questions yet to tackle.</p>

<p>Wikipedia:  Comorbidity</p>
<p>In medicine, comorbidity is the presence of one or more additional conditions often co-occurring with a primary condition. Comorbidity describes the effect of all other conditions an individual patient might have other than the primary condition of interest, and can be physiological or psychological. In the context of mental health, comorbidity often refers to disorders that are often coexistent with each other, such as depression and anxiety disorders.</p>

<p>I'm sorry for not knowing the clinical definitions, here... but how does one determine what is the "<strong>primary</strong>" condition? If I am diabetic and HIV+, who decides what is the morbidity and what is the comorbidity? Could we not look to CarePlan and discern for which conditions someone is actively under care? (and they are all... aren't they... comorbidities to each other?)</p>

<p>There should be clinically/financially recognized criteria for a condition to be the "primary" one. And for a patient, the primary condition may change over time (e.g., during different encounters).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192103">@Lin Zhang</span>  Do we "lose" anything by simply (and faithfully) identifying all of the patient's conditions as <strong>peers</strong>? It seems to me that identifying one as the primary is a bit of a "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" problem. Each clinical specialty will, of course, see all other conditions as comorbidities of the one they are focused on... but that doesn't make it so.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> , doesn't that kinda force us into some kind of update flurry if a new diagnosis is made? Every existing diagnosis now has to be pointed at the new one... and it needs to be pointed at all the other ones... and really, what is the benefit? Again, I'm not a clinician, but isn't everything in the current problem list, almost by definition, a co-morbidity? Isn't it of more value to just be able to get the list... as peers (without having to define relationships between them all)?</p>

<p>It only creates a flurry when someone decides that a new diagnosis is specifically relevant to other prior Conditions.  And the flurry could easily be a batch that updates the set, so not a lot of calls.  Not every condition would be tracked as a co-morbidity of every other condition.  The ones that are specifically interrelated that you want to flag, you can flag.  Alternatively, you can just have a patient with a bunch of conditions and have client-side logic that determines which ones to highlight as co-morbidities.</p>

<p>Information on Condition is also time-specific.  I would expect a Condition to point to its co-morbidities (if some decided they were worth tracking).  That list would be updated over time by updating the Condition, just as the severity, management level, etc. would be updated.</p>

<p>Here is a proposal for an extension representing a comorbidity, the approach suggested by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> .  It's a complex extension meant to extend Condition, with cardinality 0..*.  It has the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>comorbidityCategory (1..1) -- Represents the type or general category of the reported comorbid condition(s), for example, diabetes, dementia, or prior myocardial infarction.</li>
<li>isPresent (1..) -- Whether the comorbidity in the specified category is present.</li>
<li>comorbidConditionCode (0..*) -- A code representing the specific comorbid condition. The condition code must be consistent with the comorbidity category, and should only be provided if isPresent is true.</li>
<li>comorbidConditionReference (0..*) -- A reference to a Condition resource that is considered to be a comorbidity, consistent with the comorbidity category.</li>
<li>score (0..1) -- The severity rating or weighting score associated of the reported comorbid condition(s), consistent with the code system of the comorbidity category</li>
</ul>
<p>For fans of FHIR Shorthand, the file with the proposed implementation is attached.</p>
<p>Some pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pro -- It is anchored by, and relative to, a specific condition</li>
<li>Pro -- It allows for different systems of classification of comorbidities (this is captured in the code system of the comorbidityCategory code)</li>
<li>Con -- Not vanilla FHIR. Extensions always require custom work by implementers.</li>
<li>Con -- The means of classifying conditions is entirely implicit. For example, what ICD-10 or SNOMED CT codes are included in categories "Drug Abuse" or "Kidney disease, moderate or severe" is nowhere to be found. </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not a favor of a complex extension - you seem to be expressing a lot of duplication of information that's already present on the target Condition.  Why not just an extension of type Reference?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> There is no duplicate information. Let me give an example:</p>
<ol>
<li>What comorbidity classification system is being used, if any?  <strong>Charlson</strong></li>
<li>Is Cerebrovascular disease (as defined in Charlson) present?  <strong>Yes</strong> (yes/no/unknown)</li>
<li>What specific Cerebrovascular disease(s) is present?  <strong>I67.5 - Moyamoya disease</strong></li>
<li>What is the score (contribution to the Charlson comorbidity index) associated with this comorbidity? <strong>1 point</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The only information given by the reference is the Condition code of the comorbid condition (question #3). I'm allowing for a code locally in the extension in case there is no condition to reference.  It is a common pattern in FHIR to have a choice of a code or a Reference.</p>
<p>The reason for question #2 is to give an explicit negative if the comorbidity isn't present. You can't express that with a Reference, because the non-existence of a negative doesn't mean the condition isn't there (by the open world assumption).</p>
<p>In Charlson, the 4th question can be captured by an external definition, but there are comorbidity systems where the score represents the severity of the condition. That's why the score is there.</p>

<p>I would expect 3 to be he Condition.code for the target.  The existence of the association would indicate 'yes', so #2 is sort of redundant.  #1 and #4 might be necessary for really sophisticated systems that choose to capture that sort of thing</p>

<p>Actually a lot is missing.  If you only have a reference(Condition), you can't specify the category of the comorbidity, which is the most important thing.  Furthermore, you can't assert that a type of comorbid condition is not present. </p>
<p>What I mean by category is exemplified by the Charlson categories. (This is just one example, because other systems use different categories): </p>
<ul>
<li>#MI "Prior myocardial infarction"</li>
<li>#CHF  "Congestive Heart Failure"</li>

<p>Asserting that a comorbidity is not present is a questionnaire type thing.  In the actual Condition record, you'd simply capture the things that <em>are</em> present.  The 'category' sounds like a condition code to me - it's not "what kind of comorbidity is this?", it's "what kind of condition is the comorbidity?"</p>

<p>I don't get it. There is a patient problem list with condition A, and condition B. Now we have to add condition C to state that condition B is comorbidity to condition A, but keep it off the problem list? Or is it a legitimate third condition?</p>
<p>Doesn't it seem clearer to have Condition A and Condition B, and use an Observation with a new category, <code>comorbidity</code>, focus is condition A, code one of the category codes, method could be whatever categorization was used , and value is present, absent, unknown. Then extension on Condition B is a reference to the Observation of category comorbidity, indicating that condition B is a comorbidity to the focus of the Observation.</p>
