<p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>When I represent a medication request which has dosage instruction with start date and duration, such as "BID, start on 7/1/2020, for 10 days", how can I do this?</p>
<p>I think I can use Dosage.timing.boundsPeriod and Dosage.timing.boundsDuration, but I can't have both properties at the same instance.</p>
<p>Do I need two Dosage instances?  One has timing.boundPeriod and another has boundsDuration. If so, instruction "BID" is represented in the both Dosage instances?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>You would use boundsPeriod - [7/1/2020, 7/10/2020]</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.<br>
How would you represent if the number of days from the start date to the end date and the dose period differ such as a prescription of administering on every other day?</p>
<p>For example, "ordered at 7/1/2020, start on 7/6/2020, for 7 days every other day (that is,  from 7/6/2020 to 7/18/2020)".</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>&quot;timing&quot;: {
  &quot;boundsPeriod: {
    &quot;start: &quot;2020-07-06&quot;,
    &quot;end&quot;: &quot;2020-07-18&quot;
  },
  &quot;frequency&quot;: 1,
  &quot;period&quot;: 2,
  &quot;periodUnit&quot;: &quot;d&quot;
}
</code></pre></div>


<p>Is there any way to explicitly express a 7-day dosing period on my instance?<br>
Thanks.</p>

<p>It seems that by "dose period", you are saying that even the administration period is 15 days, the dispensed days supply is only 7 days.  That would go in MedicationRequest.dispenseRequest.expectedSupplyDuration = 7 days</p>
