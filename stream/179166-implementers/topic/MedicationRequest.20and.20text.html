<p>A MedicationRequest [https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medicationrequest.html]  has 1..1 medication and may have 0..* dosageInstructions. The dosageInstruction contains text, so there is a textual representation per dosageInstruction. This was also the case in V3.</p>
<p>In The Netherlands we experienced, already in our V3-implementations, that vendors seldomly support a textual representation per dosage instruction, but always support one textual representation per medication request (because concatenating individual instructions is simpler than the other way around). In our V3-implementation guide this resulted in a description for organizations receiving a V3-message: "if the texts in the different medicationAdministrationRequest's are identical, then make a distinct selection, otherwise concatenate all texts in the correct order". Ouch.</p>
<p>A comprehensive text is also what is usually needed on the label on the product itself (which is dispensed to the patient) and in the communication with patients / administrators and other partners in the medication process. </p>
<p>The Dutch datamodel therefore defines a textual representation on MedicationRequest level and not on dosageInstruction level.</p>
<p>What are the experiences in other countries?</p>
