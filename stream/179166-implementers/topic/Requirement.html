<p>As a product manager how will I write requirement to have FHIR compliant application? Any guidance on this topic will be appreciated.</p>

<p>"FHIR Compliant" is not a terribly useful statement.  A server that exposes a CapabilityStatement that declares that it doesn't support any RESTful resources, and messages, documents or operations would be fully compliant - but not terribly useful.  A FHIR client wouldn't even have to do that much.  Similarly, you can 'comply' with the base Patient resource and not have any capability to capture, store or share name, gender or date-of-birth.  Useful assertions of compliance almost always need to be done at the level of a FHIR Implementation Guide.  The IG sets specific expectations about what parts of FHIR need to be supported, by whom and how.  Many IGs will actually include CapabilityStatement instances that explicitly enumerate the capabilities that each involved type of system SHALL, SHOULD or MAY support</p>
