<p>lol its confusing too bad. lets say if you had a small mistake in the API we pull from the current database (which should be fairly common, and lets say such that the FHIR server does not act like a internet forum where people write and read, instead we transform some existing data into FHIR) and you want to correct that, not sure how to tell the users everywhere. and it seems there is not much available as i read in <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement.html</a></p>
<p>i do not know what people do on the other hand with the READ side, but if the JSON keep changing from time to time and there is no easy way to let users know, that could be annoying?</p>

<p>API versioning is something we've struggled with.  Fixing bugs or making changes without breaking backwards compatibility is hard.  Most of the fixes or changes I'm talking about are valid FHIR both before and after, but you still get different content, and if apps were developed to expect one (valid FHIR) thing and we change it to another (valid FHIR) thing,  stuff can break, and we have seen apps break in PRD.   We don't have a great solution yet, but one option we've considered is an HTTP header that lets a client specify which API version they want (and if the header is omitted, they get the most recent version).  A few years ago we talked about this, and whether there should be a standard versioning header, but I don't think it got any traction.</p>

<p>everyone should be aware of the RISK they take on when they chose to deploy non-normative content. And everyone wanting to use something that is currently non-normative should do what ever they can to help move it to normative. This problem is mostly solved by the governance behind normative.</p>

<p>For example, we had an issue with our implementation of DocRef where we were returning a date in DocRef.created when it should have been in DocRef.indexed.  We deployed a fix, removing support for DocRef.created, and moving our date to DocRef.indexed.    We had an app that was relying on DocRef.created, and didn't know to move over to looking at DocRef.indexed instead.</p>

<p>In fact, for R4 Patient (which is normative), we had a change where we added support for preferred names.  Initially, the patient name was sent in <a href="http://Patient.name">Patient.name</a> with use=usual.  Then we broke out legal and preferred names, and started sending two names, the legal name with use=official and the preferred name with use=usual.   Any system that was using patient name for matching, or that was expecting the name they get in use=usual to match some external name like from a wristband or paper form might need to update their app to now pull from the use=official name instead of use=usual.  This was a breaking change in the <em>implementation</em> of the FHIR spec, not in the FHIR spec itself..</p>

mmol/L and mg/dL unit changes in glucose level</p>

<p>Yeah - I agree, there are a ton of different reasons an API implementation can change that has nothing to do with what is defined in the profile or the FHIR standard.  None of those are changes from a standards perspective, but they are changes that a client app may care about.</p>

<p>The question is whether that notification and versioning is something that should be solved in the FHIR standard, or if each implementation should come up with their own solution.  A standard solution would be awesome, but addressing that sort of operational management is outside the scope of what HL7 normally handles.</p>

<p>Can't these sorts of things be handled with CapabilityStatement.software.version? (Well, at least for systems that receive the modified resources directly.)</p>

<p>There issues with using CapabilityStatement is that most folks use version as a place for major release indicators (like v.1.2.1).  The sort of change we'd need to track is more like git commit hash or something.  And at least for us, those "commit hash" style versions are not necessarily sequential, so it would really need to be a full list of the installed patches.  And it also doesn't enable using an old version (unless we publish dozens/hundreds of endpoint with different CapStatements).</p>

<p>I do think that you're talking about slightly different issues. You're talking about how to indicate that a new version of the API has been deployed, he's asking how to indicate that there's a new version somewhere else.</p>

<p>generally, this is a poisoned chalice; you can insist that everyone checks the version, and then every deploy is a drawn out nightmare because you can't get everyone lined up. Else you tell Apps about it changes, and then they ignore it; at least you can blame the apps in this case.</p>

<p>seems to me that the natural HTTP way to do this would be to use the server software header with a version, but it's also pretty loose as well.</p>

<p>Ultimately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">The Robustness Principle</a>will need to be applied by clients in any large health information exchange eco-system in which low-level data variations of the kind described by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="364778">@lychenus</span>  are bound to occur.

<p>yes, i guess its slightly different issues but the solution should be the same. now before it is defined somewhere (or if the conclusion is that there wouldn't be any definition, you-do-your-thing), there would be a "look-at-the-new-ver" thing somewhere.</p>

<p>Seconding Peter: it is true that there can be changes in a FHIR implementation that break clients, but only if the clients were brittle to begin with: the variations that Cooper describe are all within what US Core allows, so a client for US Core should be able to handle them without having to version end point. (and same for every other possible profile / implementation guide / just base specs). <br>
So <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="364778">@lychenus</span>  instead of trying to version thing I'd tell clients 'server implement FHIR version x with these profiles' and leave it at that - and they have to be robust to all variations within those profiles.</p>

<p>I don't think the issue is that client aren't brittle (due to poor design) or not robust.  The issue is that some applications just need very specific data, and need to program for it, and if the EHR moves that data around, then app needs to know about the movement.    If your app is simple and just pulls data and displays it to end users, you can be very general.  But if you have an infection control system that cares very specifically about the details of the isolates, methods, and sensitivities of a culture, you do really have to pay close attention to the structure and content of the FHIR resources, and even small changes may need review and re-testing.</p>
