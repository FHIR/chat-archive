<p>Hi - new to FHIR here. <br>
<strong>Wondering if there's a FHIR resource or extension that exists out there that I could use to store a patient's status (e.g. "new", "inactive", "ineligible"). I'd like to associate a status (one of a list that I specify) to each Patient.</strong> Here's what I've considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn't find anything on the Patient resource that seems to match this. Meta &gt; tags seem flexible enough, however this is pretty core/business-logic data, not metadata, so it didn't seem like a great fit. <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resource-definitions.html#Meta.tag" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resource-definitions.html#Meta.tag">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resource-definitions.html#Meta.tag</a></li>
<li>I've done a basic search for "status" here: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/extensibility-registry.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/extensibility-registry.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/extensibility-registry.html</a> and here: <a href="https://registry.fhir.org/" target="_blank" title="https://registry.fhir.org/">https://registry.fhir.org/</a> but I didn't find anything that quite fit our requirements. </li>
</ul>
<p>Before I go ahead and just build my own Extension, I thought I'd ask if anyone knows of one that seems like a good fit. <br>
Also, if anyone has any particularly useful resources for creating a first basic extension, I'd appreciate that too.</p>

<p>You see patients usually during encounters (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/encounter.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/encounter.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/encounter.html</a>). Encounter has a status. If this doesn't help, it's generally a good idea to consider other ressources which may reference the ressource you are dealing with, when you don't find something where you would expect it.</p>

<p>I just noticed that the value set for Encounter.status is required, so you can't use your own status codes. So maybe this was not what you were looking for...</p>

<p>Patient has an 'active' flag that covers active vs. inactive.  The notion of 'new' (presumably to the organization responsible for the patient) would need to be captured as an extension - it's too fuzzy to have much value in general exchange.  The notion of ineligible would need to be tied to "for what?" - is it relevant to a clinical study?  A planned procedure?  A type of insurance?  Where the concept gets captured will be driven by what they're ineligible for.</p>

<p>Since I need the set of possible "statuses" to meet our needs exactly, I think an Extension is the way to go. Thanks very much for the help!</p>

<p>How about group? <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/group.html" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/group.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/group.html</a></p>

<p>Group is if you're wanting to allow a collection of individuals to be a subject rather than just a single individual</p>

<p>Also status is in some form of context...<br>
(especially things like eligibility for one thing but not another) so EpisodeOfCare might help with context.</p>
