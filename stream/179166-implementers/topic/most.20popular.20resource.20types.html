<p>Based on the lists that were shared on this forum, the top 10 across those lists are (not in any specific order): Patient, Condition, Observation, MedicationRequest, Organization, Procedure, Practitioner, Encounter, Immunization and Binary. </p>
<p>On the US servers (HAPI/Cerner) the Financial resources were rather popular. Which brings me to my question: does anybody have a high level introductory powerpoint to introduce the workings of the Financial resources? Some 20-40 minute explanation suitable for an international audience, not for any specific country. Who would be most likely to have, or be able to create, such an overview?</p>

<p>Is this 'most popular' by class or by instance? ;-).  I would suspect the most instance award would; go to Observations since they're used for so many things.</p>
<p>Don't know about the Financial resources but I would suspect the big ones there (because of things like US BlueButton) are Claim, ClaimResponse anf ExplanationOfBenefits but that's just my guess.</p>

<p>..and Coverage. </p>
<p>Actually my informal list is an almagamation of the number of instances of a resource type on some servers, and most profiled resource types in IGs. Like any top 10 there is no hard a fast way of doing this, but most in the FHIR community probably won't disagree too much with the above list.</p>
