<p>OrganizationAffiliation is an interesting FHIR resource that has my brain think about all the possible applications. I'm intrigued at how we could represent Business Associate / Covered Entity relationships with this, as well as nationwide networks. However, it seems limited in its current structure.</p>
<ol>
<li>It seems to indicate a primary and secondary organization. What if the organizations are equal in their relationship?</li>
<li>It only allows for two organizations, as organization and participatingOrganization are not arrays. What if there are a network of organizations that have an affiliation? I suppose we could jam it in network, but the text for that attribute is geared towards payers</li>
</ol>

<p>That's as you dont out a whole collection, the resource is a single link, just have more instances for all of the org relations.</p>

<p>It's this one is connected to that one for this, not these are connected to that one. As there are dates and contacts and other properties specific to the relationship. Making the collection inside the resource woukd then make all those dates of memberships be in backbone elements etc and start getting larger and larger..</p>
