<p>Is there a standard (non-extension-based) mechanism for adding references to supporting information to a clinical resource?</p>

<p>As part of the workflow project, "supportingInformation" is encouraged as a standard element on all "request" resources, though in some cases a work group may decide that it's an extension rather than core and they have the right to decide it's totally irrelevant and exclude it.  So far no use-case has arisen for a general "supportingInformation" on event-type resources like procedures or observations, though the workflow pattern suggests they should support "reason" codes and relationships.</p>

<p>Our models currently have a number of supporting information structures, especially our equivalent of <code>Condition</code> and <code>AllergyIntolerance</code>.  Both serve as a record of the justification for a clinician reaching the conclusion regarding each.  Indeed, we started to find that many models required such, especially attaching images or pathology reports that are not available as structured data, e.g. just a PDF, and so we've ended up adding an implicit <code>relatedInformation</code> item to every model.  (Hence my question.)  So, basically, you're telling me that if we want to continue that practice, we need to create an extension to support it and put it in all our profiles?</p>

<p>Not sure I understand correctly. If having document which need to be linked to a clinical resource, you may create <code>DocumentReference</code> for those documents. And inside DocumentReference, you can use <code>content.related</code> to point to the clinical resource. When you want to retrive those documents for the clinial resource, you just do a search for that.</p>

<p>You use <code>DocumentReference</code> resource to link the document to <code>AllergyIntolerance</code> resource instead of adding things into <code>AllergyIntolerance</code>.

<p>Also, with the <code>DiagnosticReport</code> solution, that's a bit back-to-front because the<code>DiagnosticReport</code> is telling you that it's about the <code>AllergyIntolerance</code> rather than the <code>AllergyIntolerance</code> telling you that a particular <code>DiagnosticReport</code> is evidence of the conclusion.</p>

<p>we did have evidence in Allergyintolerance in early models, but there was not consensus about what evidence meant or what was needed, and the discussions made it clear that one of the reasons there was no consensus is because few systems do it. Hence, extensions</p>

<p>I think we need to keep in mind that FHIR is not a data storage standard. So, the real linkage is happened in your database side instead of FHIR resources. All of the <code>DocumentReference.content.related</code>, <code>DiagnosticReport.subject</code> and other linkage elments are based on your database design. And your database is the one to provide generic solution for that.</p>

<p>Yeah, so that's probably a bad example because the <code>reaction</code> element would typically cover nearly everything you need in that particular resource.  And I'm fine with it having to be an extension.  I just thought that there might be a generic solution because most resources could take advantage of being able to attach supporting information.</p>

<p>So the 80% here is not that 80% of implementations already provide supporting information for a given resource; it is, instead, that 80% of resources would benefit from being able to carry supporting information. <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" src="static/third/gemoji/images/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"> </p>

<p>Our models have a generic related information concept that carries a code to indicate the nature of the relationship between the source data and the related information.  The code set we use for this is from CEN 13606 because that set is _much_ richer than the HL7 v3 x_ActRelationshipExternalReference set  That means that the same extension can be used to supply supporting evidence, further reading, more complete data, summarised data or even "extra stuff you may need to know in order to execute this request".</p>

<p>In FHIR, the general pattern is you use a separate extension for each type of relationship.  We try to avoid embedding semantics in code-value pairs as much as we can because conformance is trickier with value sets.</p>

<p>I suppose, though, if there were circumstances where certain types of relationships were not permitted, it could be more challenging to validate, although I would have thought you could just use a constrained value set in such circumstances.  Can you have a profile of an extension?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191366">@Stephen Royce</span> There's no need to think everything up ahead of time.  If you come up with a new relationship, you define a new extension.  No different really than defining a new code, other than there's an automatic way for people to look up the definition if they don't recognize it and it's easier to declare whether you support that specific relationship or not.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> It's much more expensive in the long term to do it like that.  Adding a code is cheap, creating a new model every time is expensive.  However, the marginal cost of creating an extra one if you're already doing others, while still more expensive than adding a code, is a lot cheaper than creating the first model.  That's the reason why you'd want to try to envision all possibilities up front.  Other than that there's no real difference.</p>

Can I create a generic <code>RelatedInformation</code> extension to be used everywhere as per our current model, or should I leave that to each use case and create extensions as required by the circumstances?  I can't imagine us wanting to disallow any relationship type except for extreme edge cases, but maybe I should be thinking from a modelling perspective, what are the most common relationship types and simply create extensions for each and leave the implementers to create the rarer ones as and when they need? On the other hand, there are circumstances where we know the model must be capable of including a particular kind of related information, e.g. attaching a pathology report PDF to the <code>DiagnosticReport</code> instance.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191366">@Stephen Royce</span> But you're not creating a new model.  The new model already includes extensions everywhere they're needed.  The extension uri is equivalent to the code in your code + value pair.  There's no greater effort and no additional imposition on implementers (who will need to map either to their internal model).  </p>

<p>My job is to create the extensions and build them into profiles so that implementers don't have to concern themselves with such problems.  Consequently, every time a new type of relationship is identified, I would have to create a new <code>StructureDefinition</code> and update every profile where that new extension might be used.  This is a big job compared to have a single pre-defined extension one element of which is the type of relationship that is bound to a value set that can be updated over time.</p>

<p>That might be easier for you, but harder for implementers.  Because implementers now have to map potentially unknown codes into their internal data store and have to dig through value set definitions to see what's where.  With extensions in a structure definition, it's clear.  And it's also clear how many times it can appear, whether they must support it, what types it's allowed to reference, etc.  Far more explicit.  And still just as easy to handle transparently in a generic fashion if they wish.</p>

<p>That wouldn't be problem if the implemter modelled the data in the same generic fashion; however, I acknowledge that many, many don't and often simply for legacy reasons.  Having said that, the whole "clear how many times it can appear, whether they must support it, what types it's allowed to reference, etc." would be covered in our by use case-specific scenarios where we would further slice (and dice!) the general profile for the particular circumstance.  In this case, though, I can't see that there would be any need to do that in general because it'd be hard to say that a given type was not permissible in a given situation. i.e. an implementation would probably not need to concern themselves with such questions beyond assuming you can have infinitely many and you must support them all.  (In my experience, such assumptions are very easy to cater for in an implementation, but maybe people don't see it that way.)  Must understand them all, though, is a different thing.  If you actually mean that by "must support" then you have a case! <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" src="static/third/gemoji/images/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"> </p>

<p>Right.  But if you're slicing, then you're updating the FHIR structure definitions that reference the code anyhow - so no delta in work.  Going the extension approach forces explicitness in a way that using codes does not - which is to the implementer's benefit.</p>

<p>Nonethelesss, I'm happy to follow your approach; I'm just trying to tease out all the implications.  The main thing for me is, in our logical models, should we continue to include a general Related Information concept, or should we simply model only known requirements for particular types of related information?  If I am going to use the case-by-case extension approach, then that pretty much forces me into the latter.</p>

<p>In theory, yes.  An extension is just a profile on the Extension data type.  So you could create a generic extension profile and then use that as a base for your extension profiles.  But I'm not sure what it would buy you . . .</p>

<p>Yeah, so you obviously missed my meaning earlier.  I was thinking of a generic extensions with a relationship type element as a code and then each individual extension would fix the value of the relationship type element to a specific code, i.e. it would carry the type in 2 places: the URL _and_ the relationship type element.  Anyway, I wasn't really that serious.  I already knew what your anser would be.</p>

<p>I've been looking more closely at the <code>DocumentReference</code> resource because one type of related information that we want to support is other documents.  I'm unclear as to the purpose of <code>DocumentReference.context.related</code>; would this be the resource(s) for which the referenced document is related/supporting information or is it something else?  If the former, it seems a bit back-to-front to me.  You'd have a hanging <code>DocumentReference</code>in your <code>Bundle</code> that says "Oh, by the way, you know that <code>AllergyIntolerance</code> resource that you think you've finished processing?

<p>The target might not be a resource.  The data type of target is likely to number or things, including Reference, but also url and possibly identifier.  And besides, Reference does not actually tell you that the target is "related information".  Obviously, the information is related because otherwise you wouldn't link to it, but the semantic idea of "related information" is a little more constrained than that.  Furthermore, the generic extension could carry a code which does give more semantics that could at least be displayed to a human if not understood by machine.</p>

<p>My general attitude is that we already have a generic structure for adding new content.  Creating a layer on top of that doesn't seem to buy much other than added complexity.  From a practical perspective, how is a system going to deal with a new unknown code in the "relatedThingy" code system that's different from how it would deal with a new unknown extension URL?  The only differences I see are as follows: the system or the analysts can look up the definition of the extension definition (they're required to be able to do that if the instance is conformant).  But there's no expectation that the meaning of the code will be resolvable.  As well, it's straightforward to declare whether a given interface must support the new extension.  It's more work to do that with the code.  And finally, the ability to send the extension is already built in and requires no extra effort on the part of designers or implementers.  I really don't see the plus side of the coded approach beyond "it's what we're used to doing because we had to do it that way in 3".</p>

<p>I think Stephen is proposing to create a single coded extension where his systems would understand the extension and its purpose and the code would convey the value of the relationship. Clearly less work to program for a single extension than a 'code-table's worth' or extensions. Presumably would not require reprogramming on the interface to add codes. </p>

<p>So I hear what you're saying (although this has nothing to do with version 3; the name/value pair pattern, or, in this case, type/link pair, is a very common pattern in software development and was the first thing that every developer here thought of).  However, here's some things to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can guarantee the meaning of the code because we already have an extensive code set that I don't have a problem data typing as<code>code (Required)</code>; if anyone can think of a use case for a relationship type outside of the set we have, I'd be very surprised (at least, not in the foreseeale future).</li>
<li>I don't want to have to create a separate extension for each code in that code set, though, on the off chance that someone might use it.  (There'd be about 50 extensions, I think.)</li>
<li>You haven't addressed the "how do we stop implementers creating many varieties of extension for the same thing" problem.  </li>
<li>You seem to be assuming that implementers will be quite happy to create (conformant) extensions when they need them.  My experience of working with healthcare IT is that most vendors are very small organisations who cannot afford to do much more than the minimum and if the choice comes down to creating a properly conformant extension or not sending the data, they will do the latter.  And they'll do so silently so we'll never even find out the requirement ever existed.</li>
</ul>

<p>well, it shouldn't be - you can generate them. There's been other uses for StructureDefinition factories, but the functionality for that is currently not in the IG publisher right now. I'll be digging it up next week</p>

<p>Another thing: our set of codes has a simple, 2-level hierarchy consisting of 5 or 6 main categories, of which each has a number of sub-types if you want to be more specific; how would we capture that in the extensions?</p>

<p>It seems to me that conceptually this can be seen as one model with a code with 50 values. This is useful for understanding the design and guarantees commonality of approach, however implementation in FHIR is easier with 50 similar extensions. Even if 50 extensions is the best implementation approach, it would be nice to have a way of presenting the common underlying design. How can that be done?</p>
