<p>Case:<br>
There is a need to be able to send out specific information about separate appointments, such as patient instructions, pictures, directions, etc., to patients.</p>
<p>So, my thought is that I would like to add "supporting information" (accessible for the patient) in the appointment profile. The information could be something like "patient instructions" and would be added in the form of a url-link or an attached PDF. </p>
<p>Is there any special resource I would use as a reference for "supporting information", which could be any. Could "Attachment" be useful? <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#attachment" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#attachment">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#attachment</a><br>
Or should we just make some sort of extension?</p>

<p>DocumentReference would allow you to convey attachments.  Attachment is a datatype and can't be the target of a reference.</p>
