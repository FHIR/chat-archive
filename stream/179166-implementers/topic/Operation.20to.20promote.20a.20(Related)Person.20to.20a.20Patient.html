<p>Consider the following steps:<br>
1. I created a patient (A) which is not of full age and requires a legal guardian (LG)<br>
2. In order to represent the LG of A, I create the LG as Person (by adding it as a RelatedPerson)<br>
3. Some time later LG (which is currently represented as Person) becomes a Patient on the given resource</p>
<p>What is the correct approach to "promote" the Person representing LG to a Patient by itself?</p>
<p>I think of something like<br>
1. Searching the Person Resource for LG<br>
2. Promoting LG with some kind of operation to a Patient</p>

<p>You can create Patient (B) and a Person resource and then add Pateint B and LG to Person.target</p>

<p>Person is a set of shared demographics.  You'd create a Patient resource, clone the demographic information from it and then update the Person to link to that resource too.</p>

<p>You don't even need a person for this use case. When the RelatedPerson also becomes a patient, you just create the patient resource, and fill in the patient.link reference to the RelatedPerson instance of the same individual.</p>
