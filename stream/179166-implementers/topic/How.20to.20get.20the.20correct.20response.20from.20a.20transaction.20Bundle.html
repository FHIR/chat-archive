<p>I need to get the logical ids generated by the server when I upload a transaction Bundle. However, I cannot consistently get that information in the response even if the upload itself returns a 200 response.  Using the HAPI FHIR server, I can get the expected response if I include the following two headers:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>     addHttpHeader(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;application/fhir+json;charset=utf-8&quot;).
     addHttpHeader(&quot;Accept&quot;, &quot;application/fhir+json;charset=utf-8&quot;).
</code></pre></div>
<p>If I do NOT include the 'Accept' header, I get a bunch of xml giving the features of the server.</p>
<p>If I now move to Graham's server and use the same two headers, I get a 200 response but I get just a huge xml document in the response, and I have no information about the logical ids. <br>
How can I consistently get the correct transaction bundle response containing the logical ids?</p>
<p>I'm trying to sell the consistency of the FHIR standard here to clients so I would really like to know what I am doing wrong!!!</p>

<p>What does the XML from Grahame's server say?</p>
