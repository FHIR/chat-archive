<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to map the DG1 segment to Condition resource. For the field DG1-5 in the DG1 segment, what would be the preferred mapping? -should it be mapped to the time it was recorded (Condition.recordedDate) or should it be mapped to Condition.onsetDate or should it be mapped to Condition.asserted-date. I looked up the mapping project - <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaFYPSSq4oplTvw_4OgOn6h2Bs_CMvCAU9CqC4tPBgk/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaFYPSSq4oplTvw_4OgOn6h2Bs_CMvCAU9CqC4tPBgk/edit#gid=0</a> But they are are not sure either. It's a bit open to interpretation and would like to know what the SMEs feel. Thank you in advance. </p>
<p>To me DG1-5 sounds like Condition.assertedDate and DG1-19 (Attestation Dte/Time) sounds like Condition.recordedDate</p>
