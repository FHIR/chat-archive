<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Could you please help me with my query below. We have the following use-cases modelled in FHIR STU3 currently.</p>
<ol>
<li>Target range settings  - for example, a user may setup in an app or a glucometer, the hyper and hypo blood glucose targets for different time slots of the day. This is modelled as a CarePlan resource that links to different Goal resources. </li>
<li>User preferences/settings - for example, in a diabetes management smartphone app, a user sets up details og how he is managing his condition.. like whether the user uses a CGM device, whether he uses an insulin pump, the brand names of the devices, the units in which he prefers to read glucose and other parameters. We also have this as a separate CarePlan. In this case we have to use some extensions. </li>
</ol>
<p>The rationale behind modelling this way was that these settings and preferences are setup ultimately to manage the  diabetes condition for the user (i.e. the patient)</p>
<p>Do you suggest any other way of handling this? Many thanks in advance for your suggestions.</p>

<p>Seems reasonable.  What types of extensions did you need?</p>
