<p>Hi all, I found only one LOINC code each for "Fluid Output - gastrointestinal drain",  "Urine Nephrostomy" and "Fluid Output - gastrointestinal ostomy". But I need LOINC codes for 1, 8, 12 and 24 hour duration. Please suggest me solution. Thank you</p>

<p>I'd like to think the correct approach for this is to identify the period over which the output is collected can be represented as a UCUM unit. Unfortunately I don't know UCUM well enough, and there is no example for something that is "over x hours" so I'm not sure what the unit should be. I'm hoping someone might know how this could be done, and I'll do more investigating. I'm thinking something like "500 mL (over 1.h)" for 1 hour.</p>

<p>Ok, based on a discussion with Clem, it seems representing the duration of collection as a UCUM unit is not acceptable. The expectation is that each drain type collection duration would be a unique LOINC code (i.e.; it is a specific test, and likely would be ordered that way.) There quite a few in there already, just not for the ones you want. So I think you need to request them as new LOINC codes using the approach noted here <a href="https://loinc.org/submissions/new-terms/" target="_blank" title="https://loinc.org/submissions/new-terms/">https://loinc.org/submissions/new-terms/</a></p>
