<p>I have a situation where I'm managing a Consent registry, in which patients can grant access to their data by healthcare providers. I won't get into the details of the use case, but I need to query the registry to find the consents pertaining to a certain patient that are relevant for a specific care provider. Since concent can either be given to a whole class of care providers (e.g. all pharmacies) or to a specific care provider (e.g. just my own GP), I need to be able to specify something like the following as search criteria (in quasi FHIR syntax): Consent?patient=X AND (class=A OR class=B OR provider=Y). </p>
<p>I've read at <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/search.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/search.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/search.html</a> how the "&amp;" operator is used to apply a logical AND and how the "," separator is used to apply a logical OR, but it seems &amp; can only be used if the subcriteria apply to the same search parameter and , can only be used to separate a list of values for the same search parameter. The example I see in the text is "Patient?language=FR,NL&amp;language=EN" for patient speaks English and at least one of French or Dutch. In my example, I'm dealing with three different search parameters that need to be combined in a logical expression. Any advice is welcome.</p>

<p>Hi Tom, there's no way to group operations - this is outside the scope of what you can do on the URL. _filter (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search_filter.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search_filter.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search_filter.html</a>) would probably help you here, though it's not widely implemented.</p>
