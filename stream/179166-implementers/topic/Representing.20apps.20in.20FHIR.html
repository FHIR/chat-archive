<p>Do folks have experience describing software tools (e.g., consumer- or provider-facing apps) in FHIR? Some combination of <code>Device</code> and <code>Endpoint</code> resources, or perhaps <code>HealthcareService</code>s for apps that are in this domain? The idea here is to explain what the app is and does (and I wouldn't necessarily assume the app uses FHIR in any way; just that at FHIR-based system might want to keep a list of apps). I'm curious what ideas are out there before I go too deep on this ;-)</p>

<p>Yes, we used DeviceDefinition to represent the App. Not many attributes were usable however and a lot ended up in Extensions. In our specific case we even ended up putting most of the descriptive information, such as indication, into the ChargeItemDefinition resource, because these properties turned out to be dependent on where these apps were listed/who approved them... <br>
Apparently in our scenario the same app can be prescribed for different indications for a different price, so... <span aria-label="shrug" class="emoji emoji-1f937" role="img" title="shrug">:shrug:</span></p>
