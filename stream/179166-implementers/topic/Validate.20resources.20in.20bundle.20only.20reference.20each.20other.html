<p>Has anyone attempted to validate that all resources in a bundle only reference other resources in the bundle (i.e. the bundle is "complete") ?  That is, taking each resource, check that any reference in the resource, points to another resource in the bundle?  I'd like to do this in a field agnostic way, in Java ideally.</p>

<p>It's not something the validator does because it's not an expectation.  Resources in a Bundle commonly do reference resources external to the Bundle.  If you've profiled all of the resources in the Bundle such that all of their reference types have an aggregation of Bundle, the validator will work - though it still won't catch references inside extensions that aren't covered by your profile.</p>
