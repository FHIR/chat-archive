<p>How do you specify the department who is giving primary care to the patient during his stay in the hospital? Here in Oman government hospitals, clinical care providers are grouped under units/dept concept. Patients are never directed to a specific consultant instead, he is under the care of a group . Any of the consultant within the group will take care of the patient. So "hospitalization" mandatory specify the dept who is taking care of the patient primarily. Secondly, the history of records should be available to record the handovers between dept to dept.</p>

<p>I would expect this to be in Encounter.serviceProvider.</p>

<p>For me Encounter.serviceProvider is the hospital patient is registered and admitted while dept/unit is a clinical team who is giving care during the hospital stay. Moreover carddinality of service provider is 0..1. Within our EMR, activities during hospital stay are recorded with the following attributes, transfer time, dept, unit, consultant and the clinician in charge.</p>

<p>These are all likely locations within the encounter (which are at a department within the organization)</p>
