<p>We have a business requirement to display logos for organizations. The EHR stores these as (private) image files, which are associated with the resources, but there doesn't appear to be a place to put them in FHIR (and maybe there shouldn't be). However, we were thinking of adding a <code>logoReference</code> extension to <code>Organization</code> which points to a <code>Media</code> resource (which will contain the image files as attachments).</p>
<p>Does this seem sane? Is it an appropriate use of <code>Media</code>?</p>

<p>seems reasonable to me</p>

<p>This seems reasonable to me also, however you could also consider using the attachment in the actual extension on the organization (the binary portion could either be inline, a reference to a url, or a binary resource on the server) rather than via the Media resource.<br>
What extra would you like to use from the Media resource that isn't in attachment?</p>

<p>(This would then be more consistent with the approach used on Patient and Practitioner for the same purpose.</p>

<p>I'd be happy if you logged a tracker item for this to propose a standard extension, as I'm sure this wouldn't be uncommon.</p>
