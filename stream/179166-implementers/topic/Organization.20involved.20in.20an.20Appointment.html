<p>Hi, we have a need to be able to represent an responsible organization for an appointment. However, in Appointment resource there is no attribute available to reference an organization directly. I guess a few options could be to find the responsible organization through either a PractitionerRole, HealthcareService or Locations referenced from Appointment.participant. <br>
What is the best way to deal with this?</p>

<p>That is the idea - go via the resource(s) referenced from the Appointment. Appointments may have multiple participants, who may represent different organisations. If in your case there's only one participant, or you know the organization to be one and the same for all participants, then that's your answer. <br>
 If the responsible organization could be different than the organization of the participant(s), then you're stuck and would need an extension.</p>

<p>The more we see scheduling done across organizations the greater the need for something like this. Makes me wonder if this should be added to the core resource structure. Provenance captures some of it, in a roundabout way.</p>

<p>What exactly is the organization responsible for?<br>
Submitting the request, or providing the service?<br>
I would think the provider of the service would be what is being scheduled (i.e. the HealthCareService, or PractitionerRole)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes I would say that it is the organization providing the service and most of the times submits the requests as well but this could as well be someone else, e.g. the Patient. <br>
Going through HealthcareService or PractitionerRole seems like the correct way to do this.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Our setup is more of a national solution encompassing both regional authorities as well as municipal authorities meaning that the careteams and participants on the appointment may come from very different organizations, so we cannot assume that we can deduct the responsible organization. Hence, it is needed explicitly stated</p>
