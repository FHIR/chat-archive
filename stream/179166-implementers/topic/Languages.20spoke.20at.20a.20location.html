<p>Do any systems out there support tracking languages spoke at a location?  Something akin to the signs you see in windows or advertisements (at least in the US) that say "Se habla español".  FHIR already supports the concept of a schedulable interpreter service via the communication property on HealthCareService.  However the "Se habla español" case seems more like you are marketing to the demographic that speaks that language.  Asking for a friend (<a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-25302">FHIR#25302</a>).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191367">@Brian Postlethwaite</span> ?  Seems reasonable to have a standard extension, though whether it should be Location or HealthcareService (or both), I'm not so clear on.</p>

<p>Yes, we have the property on HealthcareService already, this was the first request on Location - and was looking for support in the community to determine if it should be an extension and stay that way, or move to core for it.</p>

<p>Is this an indication that a Location resource is being used instead of an Organization or a HealthService? When I see a window sign "Se habla español" at a store, I don't assume that everyone in the apartments above it also speaks Spanish - which is what having this on the Location resource will actually indicate.</p>

<p>I don't think it indicates that any more than having hours of operation on the Location indicates that everyone who works there is always present during those hours.</p>

<p>It would simply indicate that services are available using that language (and are available during those hours)</p>
