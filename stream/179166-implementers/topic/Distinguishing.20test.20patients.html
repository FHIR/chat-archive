<p>We have an EHR with mostly real patient records, and a few test ones. How could this be exposed? I was thinking about an extension on Patient, as using Patient.active isn't the correct semantics.</p>

<p>Many of the production health systems I've encountered in the wild follow a system of "try to use the word test in either the last name or in the first name but if you forget we'll just add a rule in the interface engine".</p>

<p>Brian has it right. When data has been de-identified, it can then be marked with the _confidentiality code of "L". This by definition tags the data as being de-identified.  We don't need an extension, the support is already there.</p>

<p>in the _confidentiality scale, it seems L is more appropriate. I guess U could be used. Of course I start with the assumption that the data comes from real-data that is de-identified. This would only move the data to L as there is no way to assure risk has moved completely to zero. However the data might be completely fabricated (random fuzzing).    I think the intent of U is more for the completely random, or data like a cafeteria menu.</p>

<p>It does seem useful to have a code specifically for 'test data'. I thought that there was one, but can't find it.  I think the easiest is to declare a security-label 'compartment' for 'test-data'... seems like an opportunity to improve the vocabulary.</p>

<p>U =  good for things like the public directory bits, like Organiziation/Location (usually)<br>
L = better for patient/clinical test data<br>

<p>it's not clear to me that this is a compartment tag. It's not about permission to access. I'm not convinced it's a security label at all. it's a tag. But we've done this before - defined a security label and then said it goes in the tag not the security label</p>

<p>The blunt model is to have a completely different system that only contains test-data. aka physical segmentation. I think the discussion is how can we use have both kinds of data combined, this does seem like a security question. Of course if you allow both combined, then you open the 'risk' that someone will accidently or maliciously set the tags to test-data; and thus cause opportunity for inappropriate disclosure. Also combined data doesn't allow you to test the non-test-data access control rules, that is in order to test that the access control system is working you must try to access real patient data, thus if it is not working you have caused a breach... so there are benefits and drawbacks.</p>

<p>yes, those are ways it could be done.... they all suffer from the same problems... So why is it not a meta tag? And why is it especially not a security-tag? It certainly seems security relevant to me.</p>

<p>well, I don't really have a trite answer to that. I feel as though putting something in a secuity tag that isn't a 'security thing' is a bit of a surprise, and we kind of hate surprises. but that's not a well founded feeling. </p>

<p>Lets keep in mind that there are multiple testing paradigms...  validation, verification, unit, integration, acceptance, end-to-end, smoke, regression, boundary, load, security, just to name a few.  In some of those paradigms, it's necessary to  test security rules; while in others it's completely irrelevant.  Likewise, in some paradigms one wants isolated test databases, whereas in others one doesn't.  From a QA perspective, having a test value in a security tag would be great.  It adds to the overall testing story.  However, it alone is not sufficient.  Just as having an isolated test database is desirable, but also insufficient by itself.  This isn't a one-size fits all solution.   </p>

<p>I know our systems have test patients in production. Various use cases for this, deployment verification being the one that first comes to mind. For this use case, at least, a meta tag strikes me as the best solution to identify a test resource.</p>

<p>I like the idea of a modifierExtension - reduces the risk of systems that don't recognize the extension using the data.  ("This isn't actually a patient" sounds like a modification of meaning to me . . .)</p>

<p>The issue I have with modifierextension or security tag as a solution to this is that both of these things can/should fundamentally change the way systems treat these resources. Generally test patients in production are there to make sure that end-to-end tests work exactly correctly.</p>
<p>The issue of course is that somewhere along the chain you want to block them, in order to prevent family physicians from receiving faxes about their patient "Testy Tester" (as has happened to us :( ) or financial systems sending invoices about Mr Testy (as has also happened to us.....)</p>
<p>Test data is hard.</p>

<p>James, not all meta tags are a 'must understand'... I think this is the critical thing you seek. Because in these cases we want the systems being tested to ignore (gracefully) this tag, while systems that do formal counting to recognize that these are test patients.</p>

<p>A test patient is simply a fictional being. It doesn't have anything to do with security (a fictional patient could have any security settings; for example, the fictional patient could have security tags allowing access to another organization for interoperability testing).  In terms of implementation, tagging is too easy to miss. Therefore, I agree it should be an boolean element in the base Patient resource. Marking it as modifying attribute is a good idea. Appending numbers to names (Smith2423) is good practice,  so human viewers could easily pick out fictional beings. </p>

<p>Mark... that is not a problem.. the security-tags are infinite in number. So just because one has the tag that indicates it is a test resource, does not mean you cant have other tags that indicate special sensitivity, or have consents with special rules. But by having the tag indicating it as a test resource, then the audit log will clearly show that the disclosure is not a real-world disclosure.   having a well-known security tag is the same thing as having a boolean element, without creating special structure. </p>

<p>I just explained that the fact that it is a security-tag that indicates it is a test patient does NOT CHANGE any other security tag or operation. IF you look back further in the thread you will see where I explain in more detail various scenarios where one would need it to impact securty decisions, and others where you would want security decisions not impacted by the tag. All of this is very easy done with security decision engines. There is nothing special about a security-tag or a tag; except that sometimes the security engine does look at it. Keep in mind that security decisions are often made on things that you might think are purely clinical knowledge. There is nothing all that special.</p>

<p>The reason why I do think it is a security tag is because distinguishing test data from real data is indeed very important to Privacy and Security. It is indeed fundamental to the very fact that Privacy is concerned with the rights an desires of the patient, and a privacy breach is exposure of real patient data. The first concern when the IT organization finds that a database is breached is to determine what classification of data was in that database. If it is the cafeteria menu, they worry very little; if it is business secrets they worry very much; if it is real patient data they know there are disclosure rules that must be followed. how is this NOT clear?    </p>

<p>Can you make a universally applicable statement about how the "test-patient" designation affects privacy and security handling of data taking into account legal, organizational, and other relevant policies?  In other words, in some organizations, test patients may be considered to be as sensitive as real data (and may be used as a smoke test in that capacity).  Contrast this to "CONFIDENTIAL" which is explicit.</p>

<p>Yet I have explained a very useful attribute of putting this in as a security tag... it will automatically end up in the audit log... if it is not a security-tag, then one must investigate object-by-object to determine which audit events are damaging vs which were on test-data.</p>

<p>besides security never asked that meta be separated into security and non-security tags... we were happy with tags, as long as there was clear rules on why a change to the meta tags were clear.  It was FHIR-I that decided that this requred that the tags be separated.</p>

<p>I guess the perspective I have is tainted by the way we've used test patients here at our hospital. To us, they aren't treated any different from a security or access control perspective. Access to their records is audited like any other, they have consent directives and break-the-glass and privacy officer notification and all the same security stuff that any other record has.</p>
<p>To us, marking test patients is all about 2 things: avoiding communication outside our walls (i.e. don't send faxes about test patients), and avoiding any of the data ending up in finance/billing systems (since these apparently do not have any way of ignoring test data)</p>

<p>Is this documented somewhere? I've never heard of that attribute of security tags, but that does seem like a good reason to use one for this.</p>

<p>Even if the audit logging system doesn't reflect the meta tag (leaving the auditevent.entity.securityLabel empty), one can always just look it up by dereferencing the auditevent.entiy.reference. It is an explicit element (.securityLabel) as not all entities that one might ever access are FHIR objects (might be DICOM, hl7 v2, CDA, openehr, xds, etc).</p>

<p>Well, I mean I haven't given it a ton of thought.. Certainly in the v2 world we had test patients and test clinicians in our production system and the interface engine had routing rules based on messages using either of those things. Individual ORUs (for example) were understood to be tests because the patient in the PID segment had test in their name. In the FHIR world you're more likely to have (say) an Observation that just has a reference to to the patient, so it would probably be best for it to have the tag/security tag too.</p>

<p>I think the issue here is just one of surprise - for people not focused on security, it's a surprise that this would be a thing defined in the security labels, because it's semantics about the data, not about it's security</p>

Maybe should clarify the wording to indicate that the securityLabels were copied from the object when the event occurred.<br>
(And in the details descriptions indicate that these may have changed since the AuditEvent was recorded)<br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191367">@Brian Postlethwaite</span>  As I indicated, if the resource is a FHIR resource then it is not critical to copy the security labels into the AuditEvent, as we can always query the resource (version) and find them. The element is there to give a place for the tags to be stored if they need to be. Given the volume of auditevent instances, we would rather recommend that only data that can't be discovered be put into the auditevent instance. </p>
