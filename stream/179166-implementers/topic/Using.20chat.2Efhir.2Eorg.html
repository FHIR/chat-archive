<p>@<strong>Sssss Sssss</strong> If you have a question that's unrelated to the current stream thread, make sure you change the stream topic when you post - otherwise your post appears in the middle of an unrelated thread.  I don't really understand your question about "I want to give this patient reference for observation" - do you mean you want to search for observations with that patient id?  If so, it would just be <code>Observation?patient=12345</code>.  In terms of your second question, look at the $everything operation define on Patient.  (The operations and profiles tab)</p>
