<p>QI Core documents their reliance on US Core for common Resources they share but I had a developer ask me a slightly different question today.  We were looking at AdverseEvent and it has an element that references the DocumentReference resource.  He asked if it should be US Core Profile of DocumentReference since that is not profiled in QI Core.  To me it seems logical that it should be but I couldn't point to anything in the IG that says that or would constrain that.  Thoughts?</p>

<p>US Core forces the use of US Core profiles unless you have a specific need.  So, I'd put in a Jira ticket to tell QI Core to adjust the reference.</p>
