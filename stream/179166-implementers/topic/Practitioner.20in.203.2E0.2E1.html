<p>Hi All,<br>
This is regarding the ‘Practitioner’ resource <br>
In our implementation, we map Practitioner as a contained reference from ExplanationOfBenefit resource. The expectation is to get Practitioner’s role and employment details (Organization) to be available along with Practitioner resource itself while someone accesses ExplanationOfBenefit. This was working well with Practitioner 1.4.0 with the ‘practitionerRole’ element. In FHIR 3.0.1 ‘practitionerRole’ elements has been removed and it doesn’t look like there is any way to know about the Practitioner Role ad associated organization from the Practitioner resource.  All these information are now available with PractitionerRole resource, however there is no links given from Practitioner to PractitionerRole.</p>
<p>In this scenario, I would like to understand the recommendation about how I can map Practitioner so that I can get the role and employment details. An extension of type PractitionerRole from Practitioner? <br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  any suggestion ?</p>

<p>In 4.0, ExplainationOfBenefit will likely be able to point to PractitionerRole as well as Practitioner so for those cases where Organization and/or role are relevant, they can be part of the link.  In the meantime, you'd need to use an extension.</p>

<p>(The presumes that ExplainationOfBenefit will align with the revised workflow pattern for Events which will be making that change.)</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> .  Thanks for sharing the upcoming update on EOB.  I think the same problem lies with ReferralRequest.requester.agent where Practitioner is referenced from ReferralRequest resource. Meanwhile I will continue with an extension on Practitioner.</p>

<p>ReferralRequest was following the old pattern.  You'd still need an extension if you wanted the role code, but the organization can be found in ReferralRequest.requester.onBehalfOf</p>

<p>Yes, we will be examining the use of PractitionerRole in FM resources, where current reference to Practitioner may be changed to PractitionerRole, and whether that is practical. THE EOB already carries the Organization so that may currently satisfy your need.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191430">@Paul Knapp</span> The workflow pattern is to have a choice of Practitioner|PractitionerRole|Organization.  Sometimes you just care that it was Dr. Smith and don't care what organization she was working for or what hat she was wearing so you'd just use Practitioner.  Other times you just care that it was XYZ hospital and don't care who did it or what hat they were wearing so you'd use Organization.  And sometimes you want to know some combination of things so you'd use PractitionerRole</p>
