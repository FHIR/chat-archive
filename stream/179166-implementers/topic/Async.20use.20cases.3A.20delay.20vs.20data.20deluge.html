<p>Today, FHIR's async support is geared toward the "data export" use case, where processing is async <em>because a server needs to sift/collate large piles of data</em>.</p>
<h2>Do folks have other use cases for async?</h2>
<p>I'm especially interested in cases where you might not have huge piles of data (in or out), but where processing might be async for other reasons (architectural decisions like work queue-driven processing, out-of-band review, etc). Use cases where you might want to asynchronously handle an individual CRUD request?</p>

<p>When working with "high frequency" patient monitoring data (e.g. HR, BP, temp, etc.) that come in at 30 seconds from every bedside in a critical care unit the load (Observation) could overwhelm many FHIR servers.   Maybe an async pattern (or FHIR Bulk Data) would help here.</p>
<p>Of course the 'flip side' of Bulk Export -- Bulk Import -- would have to handle large amounts of data and maybe that would also be suited for the async pattern (assuming the immediacy for the data to be available is 'lower priority' than current FHIR server resource data access.)</p>

<p>CDex is supporting asynch query where there's human intervention, but we want to have an ability to communicate accept/reject including reason, current 'business status' of the request, etc.  For that reason, we opted to use Task rather than the FHIR Async.</p>

<p>We're looking at async for validation. Specifically, we have a use-case where clients submit potentially very large Bundles of resources to our validation endpoint and the server needs to do full validations of everything. Since we do not want to impose an upper limit on the size, we cannot ensure that validation will finish before the call times out, so we want to offer async processing.</p>

<p>We haven't really run into use cases that need this - there is a Google-specific long-running operations framework that we use for a bunch of things (and could probably be tweaked to fit this pattern), but not for basic CRUDS. The performance impact of doing validation synchronously has been acceptable. Queuing up resources to submit asynchronously can be solved with a variety of intermediate systems.</p>
<p>The proposal is reasonable, I'm just not currently motivated to pursue it by any customer needs that I'm aware of.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick feedback! (I'm also not sure whether there's a strong need; so far, trying to capture what we heard and think about how to fill the gap.

<p>import, export, deidentify (of the whole store), configureSearch (reindexing), some of the create/delete store operations if we need more time to set up or clean up dependencies - I think that's it currently</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> , we have been looking for a direction for Async PUT &amp; POST requests (not bulk) for quite sometime now. In our setup we have legacy EHR and we have events that sync-up the FHIR server we have setup. All clients are hooked to FHIR server and they want to perform operations like creating an Order , Condition etc. Now the problem is since the EHR is source of truth we have to perform the operation asynchronously i.e., take the request and then negotiate with our EHR which is terribly slow. So yes, your proposal makes complete sense for our use case as well. As of today we are creating a Task resource to maintain/track the state of the request.</p>

<p>The introduction of my doc tries to explain this; not well enough, by the sound of your question. Briefly: current "bulk async" pattern doesn't fit well for small data outputs and doesn't have a way to convey the full response semantics of the FHIR http API (status codes, etc). I'm proposing a fairly small tweak that retains the mechanism we have in r4 and expands it.</p>
<p>This is not super urgent for my perspective but we have heard interest and I wanted to capture this in a concrete proposal.</p>

<p>Re: lost URLs, agreed there could be an API for this. From what I recall, this hasn't come up for the existing bulk data API access, but it is an issue there too. I think some server developers may have explored Tasks for something similar.</p>
<p>Re: queue protocols, is there an existing standard that you would point us to as an alternative to this mechanism? This would be a great time to open up the aperture on solutions we are considering.</p>

<p>I was unable to find standard protocol  - looks like every cloud or queue engine invented their own. I think we only need to specify posting tasks in a queue and introspecting results and as optional extension creation of queue. Potentially subscription may be used to wait for a response. We recently discussed queue as an alternative for CRUD for integration. There are concerns about how to link resources created through the queue - logical references by source identifiers? Another concern is how to keep business transaction borders - bundle?  Samurai has implemented a queue in one big project - I will ask our engineers to share implementation details. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> what is your primary use case for async crud?  Is it integration?</p>

<p>Hi <br>
A little bit details about our implementation of Integration Queue based on FHIR<br>
Our main task was to link tons of entities from different systems.<br>
For example: Patients comes from regional insurance system. Medical information from local Medical Information System<br>
Practitioners and Roles - from billing system<br>
Organizations and Locations - from another government medicine  terminology system</p>
<p>Usually, for any entities in this cases we have global identifier: for Patients and Practitioners- ssn and Individual insurance account number, for Organization - government identifier  etc.</p>
<p>We are create custom resource named IntergrationQueue<br>
Scope of this resource is primitive<br>
{status: &lt;"pending" "processed" ....&gt;<br>
 clientId: &lt;oauth client who create this message&gt;<br>
 method: &lt;"post" "put" ...&gt;<br>
 payload: {ANY FHIR RESOURCE}}</p>
<p>Example: creating Patient<br>
POST /IntegrationQueue<br>
{clientId: tfoms<br>
 method: post<br>
 payload: {resourceType: "Patient"<br>
                      identifier [{system "ssn" value "123"}]}}</p>
<p>When we create IntegrationQueue resource we are validate payload and check access rules (check does this client can do this action: e.g. can tmofs  create Patient?). After that we are save this message as regular fhir resource and return to the client id of this message. Using this id client can check status of message GET /IntegrationQueue/&lt;id&gt;</p>
<p>Another message - create Document Reference from MIS<br>
POST /IntegrationQueue<br>
{clientId: MIS<br>
 method: post<br>
 payload: {resourceType: "DocumentReference"<br>
                     subject {type Patient<br>
                                       identifier {system "ssn" value "123"}]}}</p>
<p>On another side we are have processing periodic job that take messages and process that (sometimes with tons of custom business rules)</p>
<p>So we got eventual consistency system based on logical references<br>
Our Queue is just introspectable fhir resource<br>
Queue stored in postgeresql table</p>

<p>Thanks -- this is super interesting.</p>
<p>Is the integration queue "general" with respect to the FHIR AP? In other words, can you submit (to the queue) any FHIR interaction that you could represent in a batch Bundle entry? Do you convey things like http request/response headers (say, etags) and custom operation invocations?</p>

<p>We thought about it, but we prefer to keep it as simple as possible: one message one action one resource. This approach makes it very simple to develop and testing.<br>
Transaction bundles, conditional operations, custom operations, etags - sometimes may be very useful, but it is too complex  =)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> can you clarify whether you are referring to the async writeup I shared or to the queue-based processing model Marat described, or just the general use case of better support for asynchronous stuff</p>

<p>I got alerted to this by yesterdays FHIR-I. Thanks for the write up <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> . What is not clear to  me is why the response needs to be wrapped it in a single-entry-bundle. Would it not be possible to return it unwrapped (possibly after a redirect)? It would avoid the bundle-in-bundle as well.</p>

<p>The motivation was to have a clear separation between the semantics of the response to the polling request and the semantics of the eventual response to the asynchronous operation. <code>Bundle.entry.response</code> is the one place in FHIR today where we explicitly model HTTP response headers and status codes, so I thought it made sense to reuse.</p>
