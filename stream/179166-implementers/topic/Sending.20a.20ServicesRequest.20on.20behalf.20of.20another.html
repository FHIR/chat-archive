<p>In a scenario where a ServiceRequest is being authorized/created by one person, but then sent by another (e.g., ER physician creates a referral that is sent by a discharge planner), what is the best way to communicate that relationship to the referral?</p>
<p>Current we have ServiceRequest.requester as a 0..1, but I don't see any concept that would split out author/owner/etc... (which is included in other resources like Task and MessageHeader). </p>
<p>Would adding a "sender" extension be a good approach? (the next best approach I can think of is using MessageHeader.sender, but we lose some RESTfulness there...). Are there other approaches that have been used or are recommended?</p>

<p>SerivceRequest represents the authorization.  In pure REST, Task would be used to manage the request for fulfillment.  MessageHeader takes up a lot of the functions of 'Task' in the message space - but that does indeed mean that you tend not to be able to perform RESTful queries on the state of the fulfillment.</p>

<p>I was considering Task as well for this as we do use the Task resource. However, we're using Task for fulfillment workflow management, not the sender/requester management. i.e., the owner of the task is the person that receives the referral. </p>
<p>I guess in this case that "Task.requester" could be the person that "submits" the referral and the "ServiceRequest.requester" could be the person who "authorizes" the ServiceRequest ... would that make sense?</p>

<p>Exactly.  Request.requester is the one that authorizes.  Task.requester is the one who seeks fulfillment.  Fulfillment may be sought multiple times (and initiated by different people) for all or a portion of the activity authorized by the Request.</p>
