<p>Team,</p>
<p>We have use-cases to document Patient's Appointment detail with reason, outcome and  rescheduled data.</p>
<p>below are few data elements we have clarification as we couldn't map to Appointment resource directly,</p>
<p>1. planned transportation - it will be free text to record what mode of transportation patient use.<br>
        does it make sense to have extension in Appointment.participant</p>
<p>2. if in case, the appointment has been rescheduled, we would like to handle that in the same appointment with different status, but with current status list we don't see a appropriate mapping. is there a different way to handle reschedule, like separate/new appointment?</p>
<p>3. Appointment outcome - we also have few followup documentation once the appointment is completed.<br>
below are few sample data,</p>
<p>We were thinking to map these information in Appointment.supportingInfo</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span> 1. Candidate for Permanent Access Surgery
 2. Vessel Mapping Completed at this appointment
 3.  Additional Consult Needed
 4. Follow up  Medical Clearance needed
</pre></div>


<p>Would it make sense to put the above data in DiagnosticReport/Observation (each element is an observation) or QuestionnaireResponse?</p>
<p>Appointment.supportingInfo --&gt; DiagnosticReport --&gt; Observation<br>
Appointment.supportingInfo --&gt; QuestionnareResponse</p>
<p>Please advice.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Vijay</p>

<p>one more clarification, this might be simple.<br>
if an Appointment outcome lead to a Procedure, is there a way to reference the Procedure and the Appointment.</p>
<p>currently one option we have is, referencing it through Encounter</p>
<p><code>Procedure --&gt; Encounter --&gt; Appointment</code></p>
<p>But looking to avoid creating Encounter in this context if possible, any other better option?</p>
<p>Please Advice.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Vijay</p>

<p>You could certainly submit a change request asking for Procedure to be able to be "basedOn" an Appointment, not just a ServiceRequest or CarePlan</p>
