<p>Tying the beneficiary to the Patient Resource ID generally makes sense but in an HIE like environment -that may choose to reference the Person resource internally - it may make more sense to allow Person_id  in addition to Patient ID.   I understand we could add as an extension but believe we may prefer to add directly. Not sure the process of how to get this considered if its sounds reasonable.  What argument would you have against this approach</p>
