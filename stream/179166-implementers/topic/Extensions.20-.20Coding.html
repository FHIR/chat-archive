<p>I'd like to know how to create extensions for Coding in resources.  For example, in resource ClaimResponse.item.adjudication.category,  I like to add a code "coins".   Should I just add a unique "system" with "code" in the resource directly, or should I create it through extension and what it will look like? Thanks<br>
"item": [<br>
    {<br>
        "adjudication": [<br>
        {<br>
           "category": {<br>
            "system": "<a href="http://example/ValueSet/adjudication" target="_blank" title="http://example/ValueSet/adjudication">http://example/ValueSet/adjudication</a>",<br>
            "code": "coins"<br>
          },<br>
         }<br>
      ]<br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191369">@Andy Stechishin</span> I will look into profile additions. Regarding the reason of the additions, "coins (coinsurance)" is a very common and different type from "copay".  It may be a good candidate to be included in the codeset.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192318">@jassy</span> Indeed and I would suggest that as a ballot comment or just create a tracker. I did need to check that the value set was not example (which is only for building out the examples and not intended to be 'production quality') but in this instance it is extensible</p>

<p>I'm wondering how to use this  Extension: The adoption status of the patient (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-adoptionInfo" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-adoptionInfo">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-adoptionInfo</a>) which is "Code indication the adoption status of the patient. Context of Use: Use on element: Patient". <br>
In our application, we need to capture a question "Are you adopted? Yes/No". <br>
First, it will be stored to a QuestionnaireResponse with answer of type valueCodeableConcept (system <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136</a>, values "Yes/No").<br>
Then what is the correct way to represent a patient's answer via this extension (if this extension was created for this purpose, probably it was intended to capture a patient's status to adopt a child)?<br>
1) To store only the answer but it looks weird (e.g. adoptionInfo = Yes or No) as Yes/No answers are not a status.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>&quot;extension&quot;: [
 {
     &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-adoptionInfo&quot;,
     &quot;valueCodeableConcept&quot;: {
         &quot;coding&quot;: [
             {
            &quot;system&quot;: &quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136&quot;,
             &quot;code&quot;: &lt;Y/N&gt;,
             &quot;display&quot;: &lt;Yes/No&gt;
            }
         ]
    }
 }]
</pre></div>


<p>2) Or to store the statement itself that the patient was adopted, and only in case of the positive answer, and also store as an Observation with LOINC code = 54128-4 "Adopted" and valueCodeableConcept = Yes/No from <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136</a>?</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>&quot;extension&quot;: [
 {
     &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-adoptionInfo&quot;,
     &quot;valueCodeableConcept&quot;: {
         &quot;coding&quot;: [
             {
            &quot;system&quot;: &quot;http://snomed.info/sct&quot;,
             &quot;code&quot;: &quot;160496001&quot;,
             &quot;display&quot;: &quot;Adopted (finding)&quot;
            }
         ]
    }
 }]
</pre></div>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191329">@Aleksandra Pavlyshina</span>  I suspect there is not perfectly correct answer to this, but IMO the fact that a patient is adopted is a finding, just like the fact that they are female. So I would choose that you use your last example with SCT concept 160496001. By doing this it simplifies finding this information in the patient reciord, compared to having to know what was the observation (or question) that holds the answer you want. As for the LOINC observable 54128-4 "Adopted" - I think this is bad form and would be just like crafting an observable "Female" or even "Diabetic". </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span> In our application, there is a Home Assessment consisting of a bunch of questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the patient need ambulatory assistance in their home? Yes/No</li>
<li>Does the patient need assistance with cooking meals? Yes/No<br>
Each unfavorable answer should result in creating later an Issue (in Issue/Goal/Action/Outcome model).<br>
My initial thought was to capture this assessment as <code>QuestionnaireResponse</code> and then create <code>ClinicalImression</code> (representing Home Assessment) with multiple <code>Observations</code> representing answers to the questions, e.g. SNOMEDCT code = <code>301887005 | Needs assistance at home (finding)</code> or <code>400986007 | Needs help with cooking (finding)</code>, and valueCodeableConcept = Yes/No from <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136</a>, so that we could create and bind our Issues (Conditions) to the corresponding Observations. But now I see that this indeed is a bad form for observables. How do you think what would be a correct approach in this case? And what would be a correct approach in general for such findings done in a form of some statement (like "Unsafe stairs in house (finding)", "Hazards in the home (finding)")?</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191329">@Aleksandra Pavlyshina</span> the approach I would take is that the observable you are performing is a couple of things that have to do with Activities of Daily Living. I'm not saying you need to actually encode that but it helps put things into perspective. So you are providing a series of findings based on that general observation perspective. Your questionare is essentially a series of pairs of identified findings. Sometimes the pairs are pretty easy to determine and even find in SCT, such as 400986007 | Needs help with cooking (finding) pairs with 710763006 |  Independent in cooking (finding). But I suspect others would be a bit more difficult to craft. But once you've done this you can see how recording each as a finding provides the patient data store with much more accesable and rich content. Do you agree?<br>
425205008 | Unsafe stairs in house could be a simple "unpaired finding" but you also have 301588006 | Able to manage stairs (finding) that provides additional information. I'd agree that it's not a direct opposite of the former, but understanding that you are looking to record findings, not yes/no to complex "states" gives you some freedom, plus there are a host of other concepts in that area of SCT that provide more "stairs assessment" so could be allowed as nuanced answers in the questionair. <br>
Thoughts?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span> I do agree. So, if my understanding is right, I need to find a corresponding concept for Observation.code and two most appropriate concepts for Yes/No answers, e.g. for the question 'Does the patient need assistance with grooming?' there will be <code>Finding related to ability to perform personal grooming activity (finding) SCTID: 704433000</code> and answers <code>Difficulty performing personal grooming activity (finding) SCTID: 704439001</code> for 'Yes'  and <code>Able to perform personal grooming activity (finding) SCTID: 704441000</code> for 'No', and Observation.category will be 'survey'. Probably I need to specify the original question in the Observation as codableConcept.text?<br>
Can I ask you what do you thing about the approach in general: to store asnwers in a QuestionnaireResponse, then create Observations and reference them in the ClinicalImpression.investigations.item (e.g. for this case it can have <code>ClinicalImpression.investigations.code</code> =  'Activity of daily living needs assessment (procedure) SCTID: 422533001'), then for unfavorable Observations create Conditions (category = 'problem' from <a href="http://argonautwiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Problems_and_Health_Concerns" target="_blank" title="http://argonautwiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Problems_and_Health_Concerns">http://argonautwiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Problems_and_Health_Concerns</a>) and reference the corresponding Observations?</p>

<p>Actually, no, you don't want to use the SCT grouping code Finding related to ability to perform personal grooming activity (finding) SCTID: 704433000 as the observable. That code is a "finding" but really is there simply to group the codes it subsumes. What you really want is to represent an observation, we say an "observable." While SCT does have observables, we want to use LOINC codes if possible. There are a couple in LOINC but this places us squarely into an area that is muddy at the moment - in fact the clinical LOINC meeting happening at this moment will discuss this tomorrow. So I might have a more authoritative answer next week, would that work?</p>
<p>Are you doing this for use in the US? I ask because there is another wrinkle - the IMPACT act dictates that CMS wants many ADL-type assessments plus  skin and wound assessments to be uniformly collected. This is part of the discussion going on at the LOINC meeting. So if you want to use this in the USA, you should work to align with what ever IMPACT is doing.  </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191329">@Aleksandra Pavlyshina</span> The LOINC meeting last week clarified the use of individual concepts (an observable question in this case) drawn from a surevey instrument (a panel.) They clarified that an individual question that is part of a survey instrument CAN be used to represent that observation made outside of the survey. There are two requirements that must be satisified when this is done (this is true of the use of a single code, or the entire survey): 1) The instrument using the LOINC concept (such as the tool you are creating) must include attribution of the survey as the source of the code (in addition to LOINC in general) (see <a href="https://loinc.org/downloads/files/hl7-lint-setup/loinc-and-relma-copyright-and-terms-of-use" target="_blank" title="https://loinc.org/downloads/files/hl7-lint-setup/loinc-and-relma-copyright-and-terms-of-use">https://loinc.org/downloads/files/hl7-lint-setup/loinc-and-relma-copyright-and-terms-of-use</a>), 2) If the observable has a Normative answer set, the recorded result must be drawn from the normative list. This means if you find a LOINC observable that matches your needs, you can use it to represent "the question asked/observation noted." Of note, when someone follows your guide and makes patient records based on it, when they record the LOINC codes in patient data, they don't have to carry the survey attrribution in the file. </p>
<p>If you find that the LOINC observable you want (remember it must align with the meaning you want to represent) is in LOINC BUT it has a normative answer list you don't want to use, you will need to request a new LOINC code. </p>
<p>Based on the ADL template in C-CDAR2 r2.1 and this discussion we have tentitvely proposed new LOINC codes for the following "self care" observables: <br>
Bathing<br>
Dressing<br>
Toileting<br>
Feeding or Eating<br>
Transferring<br>
Ambulation</p>
<p>The presumed answers for any of these will be the following set of SCT codes:<br>
SCT code    FSN Display<br>
371150009   Able (qualifier value)  able<br>
371153006   Independently able (qualifier value)    independent<br>
371155004   Able to and does (qualifier value)  able to and does<br>
371152001   Assisted (qualifier value)  assisted<br>
371154000   Dependent (qualifier value) dependent<br>
371151008   Unable (qualifier value)    unable<br>
371156003   Does not, dependent (qualifier value)   does not<br>
371157007   Has difficulty doing (qualifier value)  difficulty<br>
385640009   Has difficulty doing (qualifier value)  does</p>
<p>I'm not clear (yet) as to how well this LOINC proposal that directly aligns with C-CDAR2 r2.1, aligns with what the IMPACT act will expect, but I hope they will align. </p>

<p>we prefer to solve real problems, not manufactured ones. My opinion is that the definitions of the codes should establish the linkage, and it should not be necessary to mention this fact in the instrument where the codes are being used</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> That simply makes no sense. I have no idea how "the definitions of the codes should establish the linkage" solves this requirement. <br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191978">@Daniel Vreeman</span> We should discuss. Seems there is no interest in documenting the provenance of LOINC questionair codes here on FHIR objects.</p>

<p>so I use code LOINC xxx-x which is associated with a particular survey instrument in an observation - and observe a value for that code. that's the context we're talking about, right?</p>
