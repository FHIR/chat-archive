<p>Hello all - experimenting with queries and learning about resources. Hoping for some guidance to get started. </p>
<p>For our use case, consider a practitioner wanting to create a list of medications from all their patients. Which resource would we want to start with? Possibly MedicationRequest? Still learning about object relationships.</p>
<p>Thanks for any and all help!</p>

<p>MedicationRequest and/or MedicationStatement.  The former represents prescriptions (and sometimes plans and proposals).  The latter represents patient declarations and/or summary views of a patient's medications.  They include non-prescribed as well as ordered meds.  Exactly which will be present depends on who you're talking to, so if you want to be safe, grab both.  And if you want to be exhaustive, you can hit MedicationDispense, MedicationAdministration and even Immunization and summarize.</p>

<p>Depends on where you are, you may indeed want to use dispense (which in some countries is seen as the most reliable "official" indication that the patient is on the meds)</p>
