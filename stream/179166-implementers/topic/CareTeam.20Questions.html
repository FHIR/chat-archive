<p>Hi all, a few questions regarding the CareTeam resource:</p>
<p>1. What is the meaning of CareTeam.period?<br>
Current description: Time period team covers</p>
<p>Question:<br>
Which period does this item cover?</p>
<p>a. The period the team exists or is in effect? OR<br>
b. The period the team delivers care to the ‘subject’?</p>
<p>Considerations:<br>
- Some teams exist to act if the need arises, such as a resuscitation team. In case of such a team ‘period’ could have meaning a.<br>
- If a patient has one or more problems, meaning b. would be most useful.<br>
- However, the meaning of ‘period’ should not depend on whether the team is assigned to a subject or not.</p>
<p>2. What is the meaning of CareTeam.participant.period?<br>
Current description:       Time period of participant</p>
<p>Question:<br>
Which period does this item cover?</p>
<p>a. The period the participant is a member of the team in general? OR<br>
b. The period the participant delivered care in a specific role?<br>
Considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>A participant may have more than one role within the team or may, for example, change form a role with a small responsibility to a role with a large responsibilty.</li>
<li>If the answer to the question is ‘period of membership of the CareTeam in general’, then how can one specify the period in which the participant fulfilled a specific role in the care for the subject?</li>
</ul>
<p>3. What is the meaning of CareTeam.reasonCode?<br>
Current description:       Why the care team exists</p>
<p>Question:<br>
In what way does the meaning differ from reasonReference?</p>
<p>Considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘reasonReference’ has the same description, but the type is ‘Reference(Condition)’. ‘Condition’ requires a ‘subject’, so it seems that ‘reasonReference’ represents the medical problem/disease of the subject for which the care team delivers care.</li>
<li>Does ‘reasonCode’ represent the disease/problems for which the team can be assigned in general? If not, then what is the meaning of this item?</li>
</ul>

<p>1. It's the period of time the team is in existence.  If the subject changes, that would typically be considered a new team instance.<br>
2. It would be for the specific role<br>
3. One lets you describe the reason with code or text, one lets you point to a resource</p>

<p>About 2: In the current resource, multiple roles can be assigned to a participant, so if one changes from one role to two roles, one must create a new Participant? </p>
<p>Participant "mister x" has been coordinator(role 1) and GP (role 2)  from 2019-01-01 until 2019-06-01. On 2019-06-01 it is decided that "mister x" turns over the coordination role to someone else and is just GP (role 1) from now on wards. So he will have only the GP Role from 2019-06-01.</p>
<p>The only way to model this in CareTeam is to create two Participants for mister X, one with 2 roles and a stated period from 2019-01-01 until 2019-06-01 and one with just one role, stated with a startdate of 2019-06-01.  Am I thinking correctly?</p>

<p>In the end, whether you create a new participant depends on your policy.  If you want the team to show a record of who was doing what when, then yes.  If that's not so important, then no.</p>

<p>I understand, that one instance of CareTeam is assigned to a single Patient and the same Patient may be cared of by multiple CareTeam(s). But in real world it seems a Care Team say composed of 5 practitioners cares for multiple patients about 10 to 15 and in night shifts even more.</p>
<p>So I have a hospital where they have 10 care team names and they want to list all Patients that are being cared for by a given care team name. </p>
<p>Is there a way to accomplish this? i.e. list Patients that have been assigned the same CareTeam ?</p>
<p>it seems there may not be a 1-to-1 correspondence between real world concept of care team and FHIR resource CareTeam and any given point in time there would be more CareTeam resources than Patient resources, since <code>CareTeam.subject</code> <a href="http://build.fhir.org/careteam-definitions.html#CareTeam.subject" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/careteam-definitions.html#CareTeam.subject">cardinality is 0..1</a> . </p>
<p>Am I correct?</p>

<p>You might also want to consider using Organization to describe these 'groupings' of Practitioners. This is a debate we're having also...</p>

<p>Not sure what the best approach is to minimize the network time to fetch the data of Patients in a CareTeam that have not been discharged</p>
<p>one approach is using some background thread to pre-fetch the resources and in doing that if multiple sub-queries are to be done then its not a big deal</p>

<p>I was suggesting that instead of using CareTeam to describe the 'fixed' teams (like Diabetics Assessment for example) that you use Organization for that. Again just a thought - we've not yet come to a landing ourselves...</p>

<p>hmmm.... interesting use of Organization, so far I was thinking of Organization as Hospital/Clinic/Vendor etc, thanks for enlightening me</p>
<p>however if you use Organization to represent the concept of care team then <code>Patient.managingOrganization</code> will be used for this relationship, right?</p>

<p>and how would you keep the relationships in sync i.e. when patient is discharged he is obviously not being cared for the same team any longer.</p>

<p>In this scenario you'd use the CarePlan to indicate that a given 'team/Organization' was involved in the patients care - eg detail.performer...</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191321">@David Hay</span> what's the idea of using Organization for grouping Practitioners when CareTeam has <code>.participant --&gt; .member --&gt; .reference</code> referring to Practitioner ?

<p>Don't think one is better than another - depends on the use case. If you want to say that the diabetic assessment 'team' will assess the patient, then Careplan.activity.detail.performer can refer to the Org that represents the Diabetic assessment 'team'. If you want to say that Dr. Smith is involved personally, then you can have Careplan.activity.detail.performer refer to the individual. </p>
<p>It's all about whether the 'CareTeam' resource makes sense to be used when it's not specific to a patient, and I don't think there's a single correct answer. Others may have different opinions!</p>
