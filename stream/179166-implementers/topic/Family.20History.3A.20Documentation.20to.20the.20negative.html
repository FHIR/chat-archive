<p>Hi, we're looking at using FHIR for Family Member History (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/familymemberhistory.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/familymemberhistory.html</a>)</p>
<p>The resource looks well-designed for identifying family history where a condition was documented.</p>
<p>However, our clinicians are also interested in explicitly documenting on the negative, for example "No family history of cervical cancer", or "No family history XYZ".</p>
<p>I was wondering how people are approaching that? I was thinking that we could use the .code field, and include my organization's local / internal codes related to "No family history of XYZ". This would be akin to our internal valueset.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this approach, or recommendations otherwise? Or is there another resource or extension I should consider?</p>

<p>HL7 AU Base uses that type of approach in lists.<br>
It has an Observation profile <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/StructureDefinition-au-norelevantfinding.html">AU Assertion of No Relevant Finding </a> with codes from the ValueSet <a href="https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/ValueSet/assertion-of-absence-1">Assertion Of Absence</a></p>

<p>Right.  Observation is the way of capturing high level generalizations about "family history of X present" or "no family history of X present".  FamilyMemberHistory is for when you want to know exactly who had what (and when, and what the outcome was) to get a more nuanced view.</p>
