<p>Hi all,<br>
We're trying to manage conditions and episodeofcare diagnosis list (which refer to condition) together. We would like to manage it with one api call. <br>
For example we would like to add a new condition and this condition will be used as a chief complaint in the current episode of care. We also would like to retrieve all patient's condition and the current episode. Then we could categorized all conditions (chief complaint or comorbidities of the episode and other condition's not related to the episode)<br>
Should we use operations on resource episode or patient, or transaction will suit more?<br>
Thanks for your help</p>

<p>If you define a custom operation, most systems won't support it.  There's much broader support for transaction, though even that won't be supported everywhere - and some systems may have limits on what resources or what types of actions can occur within a transaction.</p>
