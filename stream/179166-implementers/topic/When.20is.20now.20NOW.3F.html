<p>"Upon dispense" isn't terribly relevant if you're talking about floor stock or something on a crash cart.  It also can't be "as soon as the order is created" - as in emergency cases, the order doesn't created until after the administration/procedure/whatever is done.  My general leaning is to say that "NOW" might be better phrased as "immediately" with a definition of "as soon as possible once the request is effective".  If you're capturing a retrospective order, the effective start time would be at the time the decision was made.</p>

<p>Is this what would be used in templates or guidelines?</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I can ask this without unintentionally falling into parody.  </p>
<p>Is the "now" intended to be from the point of view of "now" or from some point in the future, looking back on the "then" that was "now" when it was "then?"</p>
<p>Since I don't have high hopes for that sentence, I'll give two examples:<br>
1. When reviewing yesterday's med administrations, a clinician can see that he or she ordered a med with the intent that the med be given to the patient immediately. <br>
2. A clinician ordered a med that should be given to the patient immediately.  It hasn't been administered yet but hopefully will be quite soon.</p>
