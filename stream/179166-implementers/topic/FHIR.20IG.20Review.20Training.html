<p>Formal Announcement: FHIR IG Review Tutorial, Sept 13 2019, Atlanta</p>
<p>In the lead-in to the Atlanta WGM, HL7 is running several tutorials aimed at increasing our capacity to create and publish high quality FHIR  Implementation Guides (IGs).</p>
<p>One of those tutorials is focused on reviewing IGs. it runs on the afternoon<br>
of Sept 13 (1:30 - 5:00) and covers:<br>
- understanding the typical structure of HL7 IGs<br>
- a typical approach for reviewing an IG (e.g. ballot review)<br>
- understanding HL7 ballot<br>
- how to compare different versions of the same IG<br>
- how to compare different IGs for consistency</p>
<p>There are no pre-requirements but it will help to be familiar with the resources, data types, how terminology works, the REST API, and profiling; the tutorial will not be covering the basics of these things. </p>
<p>The total number of attendees for this tutorial is  limited, though we expect to have enough capacity for anyone who is interested. In case we run out, availability is on a first come / first served basis. </p>
<p>Please register by sending an email to <a href="mailto:grahame@hl7.org" title="mailto:grahame@hl7.org">grahame@hl7.org</a>. (No deadline, just until we run out of space).</p>
<p>There is no cost for the tutorial (ONC is covering the cost - thanks); instead, we are looking for to grow our ballot pool size, and also the number  of people able to review IGs during the preparation process to ensure consistency across HL7 guides. Note that we are not covering travel <br>
costs for this tutorial.</p>
<p>We expect to record the tutorial and make it available, and to make additional follow up tutorials subsequently.</p>
