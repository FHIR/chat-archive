<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was looking at the different type of orders/requests we have in FHIR.<br>
   We are trying to map FHIR for dialysis services. Once a patient gets into one of our clinic(episode of care), he will have dialysis on a daily basis or on a scheduled frequency(Encounter). To perform the dialysis, we are mapping the dialysis order against ProcedureRequest. We can place a global dialysis order which will be valid for the entire period the patient is associated with our clinic. And from the global order we can derive individual order which will be applied per encounter of the patient. I was wondering why is the ProcedureRequest not associated with EpisodeOfCare and only associated with Encounter. Procedure FHIR resource which is an output of ProcedureRequest seems to be associated with EpisodeOfCare/Encounter. But ProcedureRequest is associated with Encounter only. Is there any reason why ProcedureRequest is not associated with EpisodeOfCare?</p>

<p>This will change when we apply the "request" workflow pattern to ProcedureRequest (i.e. encounter will get renamed to context and support a reference to either Encounter or EpisodeOfCare)</p>
