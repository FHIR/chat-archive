<p>A question about what is allowed to go in contained. From the constraints: <code>If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL be referred to from elsewhere in the resource</code>. But this precludes including a resource that references <em>back</em> to the containing resource.</p>
<p>An example - we have a system that records patient-level insurance and guarantor information, but not accounts. As far as I understand, the FHIR way to represent this is to have a patient-level Account resource that references the coverage and guarantor resources. However, since we don't actually store account information, the account resource is not identifiable. Storing the unidentifiable account resource in patient.contained seems in-line with storing an unidentifiable generalPractitioner in patient.contained, but it is not allowed since there is no direct line of reference from Patient -&gt; Account.</p>
<p>Is there an alternative to creating standalone, unidentifiable Account resources or sticking an extension on Patient to point to Account, so it can be included in contained?</p>
