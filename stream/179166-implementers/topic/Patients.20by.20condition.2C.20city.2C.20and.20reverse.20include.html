<p>Hey, so I'm trying to pull date from my Fhir server, where we can search for patients by a condition and by a city, while also reverse including other resources related to the patient. I've tried this in multiple ways and have yielded no luck so far. Any advice? So far, I've tried: a) Search Conditions, include patients, restrict patient city, chain reverse include references to patient (last part didn't work because chain reverse includes don't seem to work), and b) Search Patients, restrict city, reverse include references to patient, restrict conditions (last part doesn't work because you can't reference a patient's condition because it's a revinclude). Any other possible options?</p>

<p>which srver were you using? so far, only HAPI supports reverse include. I'm intending to add support for it to my server by the connectathon</p>
