<p>Hi - I would like to tie the HealthcareService and Patient together, as to represent that a patient used the service at a given time/date.</p>
<p>Encounter seems like a fit but it does not have a reference to HealthCareService only to Organization.</p>
<p>Any Ideas on how to tie these two together? There is no appointment information available other than the date/time</p>
<p>Would ServiceRequest as completed suffice?</p>

<p>In R5 we've extended the participants to include the HealthcareService, and also still further discussing other options here too.<br>
Otherwise as you've noted, the appointment in R4 already has the linkage in it - so you could use that - probably more appropriate than creating a ServiceRequest if there wasn't one already too.</p>
