<p>I'm looking at capturing patients being a risk of different diseases. In <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/condition.20-.20expected.20to.20be.20risk">this related thread</a>, the suggestion was to use a Condition with a code stating "risk of X". But suppose we have no code for "at risk of X" but only a code for the condition X itself. Is there some pattern for using just that code plus other fields/generic codes to produce a resource that unambiguously states that the patient at risk of X?</p>
<p>Some options I considered but was not quite happy with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use post-coordinated SNOMED codes, e.g. using the "Risk of" qualifier (SNOMED 30207005) - requires the downstream systems to be able to handle composite codes (also, not sure what the right correct SNOMED should be <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span>  )</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/riskassessment.html">RiskAssesment</a> - not sure if that would be an appropriate use of that resource &amp; not sure where the code for X could go (one can reference a Condition, but then I'm not sure what that Condition should hold, given that I don't want to have a resource saying that the patient <em>has</em> X)</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) might be workable (if I can figure out the right SNOMED expression...), but are there alternatives?</p>

<p>Only other alternative I can think of would be a modifier extension</p>
