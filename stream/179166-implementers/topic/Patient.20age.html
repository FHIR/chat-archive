<p>I have been in some discussions around a concept of storing 'age' as a proxy for date of birth for Patient (as an extension) - this is to handle uncertain and approximations to date of birth e.g.. around 70 years old; in their 50s.  Has anyone addressed this before?  It seems not at all useful as a quantity by itself; would need to record when the age was asserted. </p>

<p>I thought that was the purpose of being able to state that the birth date was "1950", maybe an extension that covers the certainty of the values. Some people know that there birthday is 20th January, but it could have been 1923, 24 or 25! As records were lost at the time (more unlikely now)</p>

Do we just pick a year that's close and assume that's good enough?  How would that work in a data matching scenario because a different system may have picked a different year?</p>

<p>We've already added exactly this extension to our own (internal, unpublished) patient model. But I was wondering if there was a more generic -- i.e. non-Australian-specific -- solution.  Also, the codes here conflate 3 separate pieces of information and become difficult to use in a semantic context.  (They feel _very_ 1980s to me!)  Furthermore, now that you don't have to state day or month, the use of a 3-character code would not always be appropriate.</p>

<p>By way of another pattern to consider, FamilyMemberHistory has an age choice of data types (Age, Range, or String) with a corresponding estimatedAge boolean.  This allows for saying "estimated 70 years old" or "estimated 50-60 years old"</p>

<p>I get your point, but I would clarify that the FamilyMemberHistory.age isn't defined as age at death, but instead defined as "The age of the relative at the time the family member history is recorded" with another attribute to indicate when recorded -- FamilyMemberHistory.date</p>

<p>The French philosopher Jean Baudrillard has a relevant model in Simulacra et Simulation.  He discusses the four classifications of images - originals, copies, copies of copies, and simulacra; which is used within some Radiology departments as a model for describing reference vs diagnostic quality images vs synthetic avatars and simulacra such as the Talairach-Tournoux Brain Atlas.  The AEU model of Accurate, Estimated, Unknown is roughly similar in purpose... estimating the knowability and quality of the purported knowledge.  </p>
<p>Michelle's point about "the age of the relative at the time the family member history is recorded" is similar in quality to the problem of a Radiology department scanning an analog radiograph with a flatbed digital scanner.   </p>
<p>It's an interesting trend, and will only grow with the advent of wearable biometric devices.  Is the quality of a weight measurement at home the same as at a hospital?  Is there a difference between a calibrated device taking the measurement, and an individual copying that data in by hand?  I haven't seen any coding or standard besides Baudrillard's model (and now the Australian AS4590 standard, thank you!), but there seems to be a growing need for such a model.</p>

<p>I am looking for a solution to include the Patient´s age to a document Bundle (R4), but did not find any explicit representation of the age. The document itself is a snapshot of an assessment, which has a Patient resource. After reading the FHIR specs and FHIR chat i´ve found two possible ways. (Samples below)</p>
<ul>
<li>Add an Observation to the Bundle entries with a specific Loinc-code and stores the age in the value field. The observation would have the reference to the patient in the subject field. </li>
<li>Add an extension to the Patient resource using the valueAge field</li>
</ul>

<p>I tend to suggest age is an observation on a patient that is true at a particular instant in time. </p>
<p>Your observation almost looks right but you ought to add the Observation.effective[x] field in there that says when this is true. Age makes no sense without the context of when.</p>
<p>In terms of Patient, I wouldn't ever usually suggest putting too much on there that is likely to change regularly or predictably. I think really carefully about using address within Patient, especially if it being used to give context to other data. Age would be a definite no for me in almost every case.</p>

<p>By doing it this way, the age extension is not part of the resource. The server would be responsible for calculating and injecting the extension, at the point when the resource is served. Essentially changing the contents of the resource but not updating the resource. </p>

<p>Either of these methods can expose the patients birth date however. I query for the Patient resource on Jan 3 and get age 50. I query again on Jan 4 and the response is 51. What is the patient birthdate?</p>
<p>Also either method, you need to return the UOM as well. 50 yr/mo/day/hr/min</p>

<p>I would lean towards an extension present on each individual resource in the bundle that reflects the patient's age at the time relevant to that resource (e.g., either Lloyd's suggestion of <code>relative-date</code> to <code>birth</code> or something similar).</p>
<p>To continue the example above, it's fine that you are querying on Jan 3 and Jan 4, and the patient is currently 50 or 51.  But an <code>Observation</code> in the bundle was made when the patient was 50 (or 48, etc.), regardless of the patients <em>current</em> age.</p>
<p>Putting 'current age' over old data can cause patient safety issues (e.g., the doc thought they were looking at something from this year, but it was from 5 years ago).</p>

<p>If the resource is "Patient" what is the "patients age relevant to the resource". <br>
If the requirement is to keep the patients birthdate private, then providing a means to derive that birthdate doesn't seem to meet the requirement.</p>
<p>Yes, an age extension on an Observation would be the age at the time of the Observation. An age on a Condition would be age at diagnosis, age at recorded, age at last occurrence or age at resolution?</p>

<p>Yes, but if you use Age you also need to ensure that you always keep it up to date (e.g., increment age next year) <em>and</em> ensure that it is only done once, ensure that downstream systems that read the age have context, etc.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, I have seen several incidents because a patient's Age was out of sync when a practitioner read it.. I tend to try and steer people away from using it.</p>

<p>Putting age in an 'identifier' would absolutely be a bad idea.  When sending data in FHIR, it's important to respect the meaning of the element - and 'age' is definitely <em>not</em> a unique identifier for the patient.  If you need to transmit age, Observation is best, extension (ideally with two components so you can communicate 'age' as well as 'as of when?') is second best.</p>

<p>You don't have to modify the structure definition to use an extension - extensions are built into the resource in all locations they're allowed - and I presume Azure has support for extensions.<br>
To make an extension searchable, you just define a SearchParameter for it - and configure the relevant server to support it.  Depending on the SearchParameter and the server, that can be as simple as uploading it or sticking it into the correct file location.</p>

<p>Where else? Age is mostly of clinical relevance, whereas the patient is about demographic/administrative details of the patient. Birthdate fits with the latter category, whereas age doesn't. Observation has the advantage that it allows one to specify the author of the observation and the date that the observation was made. Age may be an estimate, and may or may not be based on all sorts of other things such as x-rays of the hand.</p>

<p>I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191372">@René Spronk</span> . Add to that, that there are ways to get your edge case results. But as an edge case, the model is not optimized for you, and you thus will need to work harder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why observation?.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would ask, "Why store a calculable field anywhere?" I certainly understand the need for age observations. "When you are rolled through the ER door, unconscious, the provider says patient appears to be male, appears to be 50-60 years old...." But if you know something about the birthdate then you can calculate for any criteria you want. Having the hard and fast discrete data point on which to make the calculation, trumps the need to have assorted stored aggregate values. </p>
<p>Try saying, "I want all patients that have an age observation with the value between 20 and 40 where the observation was taken between 2020-2021." You likely aren't going to get what you want. "All patients with birthdate between 1982-2002." Is likely more precise.</p>

<p>Age is a point-in-time value.  Observation is where we capture point-in-time values.  In general, we try to avoid persisting age at all because working with is complex.  ("2.3 years ago they were 32 years old" is somewhat miserable to work with.)</p>

<p>One key thing to be aware of is that the data in a resource is 'static' unless the server receives an update - and if there's an update, then the version changes and a new entry gets added to history.  So, for example, if you created a Patient instance with an 'age' extension, that age can't change dynamically.  It's fixed until/unless someone sends an update to change the Patient record.</p>
