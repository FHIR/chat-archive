<p>In STU3, Measure.group.population.code is an enumerated list of codes (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/valueset-measure-population.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/valueset-measure-population.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/valueset-measure-population.html</a>).  One change from DSTU2 to STU2 was the removal of the measure-score concept from this list. Does this mean that measure score is no longer considered one of the populations that need to be identified by the measure? How is the expression for the measure score denoted in the measure resource?</p>
