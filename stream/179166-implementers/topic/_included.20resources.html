<p>When running a search that has _include, is there ever a scenario that users have come across where you would return a single resource twice because it met the base critieria and also the include criteria? For example, if you search for Locations and include partOf, which references a location, would you expect to get the part of locations twice, once because it matched the search and once because it was included, or just a single time? And if its just a single time, how do you decide on if it should be brought in due to the match or due to the include? FYI <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="273190">@Moira Dillon</span></p>

<p>It's definitely not allowed to have two copies of the same resource in a bundle. I assume it would have entry.search.mode=match in that case but I'm not aware of spec language saying that explicitly.</p>
<p>This is something I want to nail down better by adding an extension to <a href="http://entry.search">entry.search</a> that indicates where the include/revinclude connections are (which clause brought it in, and from which resource or resources). My proposed pattern will be that this case would have mode=match but also the extension showing the include.</p>

<p>We currently say: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is only one mode. In some corner cases, a resource may be included because it is both a match and an include. In these circumstances, 'match' takes precedence.</p>

<p>Note that an _include might show up on multiple pages - so something might be referenced as a match on page 1 and an include on page 2 and 3.</p>
