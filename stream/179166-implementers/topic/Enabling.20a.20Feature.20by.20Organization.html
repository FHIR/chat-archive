<p>The lab we are building a portal has requested we build a in a feature that they should be able to enable and disable by Organization. The feature would allow the Practitioner to assign an Identifier to the Patient that is specific to their organization. The provider should only be able to do this if the Organization they are tied to is enabled for this. Where, in your opinion, would be the best place to store the switch for enabling the feature?</p>

<p>This doesn't sound like something that would need to be shared across systems.  However, if you need to capture it in a FHIR-based repository, an extension on Organization sounds reasonable.</p>
