<p>Good morning guys,<br>
We are at our company implementing an interoperability workflow using FHIR DSTU2, where providers can bring attention to our patients and send or consume patient information through out interoperability workflow.<br>
We've got a couple of concerns about our providers consuming patient information, that maybe your experience can help us with.<br>
- Can you briefly describe how do you manage this kind of scenario ? Sending and retrieving patient information-<br>
- What data should be mandatory to be able to consume patient information? Only patient identification ? any other relevant information ?<br>
- Don't know if you guys can face the following scenario, about a patient changing ID number. We have patients that under 18ys have an id number, but once they get over 18 thresold they will get a new ID number. If so, how do you manage this and data consistency between both systems ?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, I'll be keen to respond any follow-up question.</p>

<p>Are you looking at using REST, messaging or documents?  In terms of what should be mandatory - you mean to verify patient identity?  That's entirely a policy question.  Answers vary depending on the quality of the identifier and associated information and common business practice.  There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer.  In terms of managing changes to identifier, how do systems handle it now?  Does anyone maintain a mapping between the two identifiers?  DO you just match based on demographics?  FHIR wouldn't be any different.</p>
