<p>When looking at <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/composition-operation-document.html">https://hl7.org/fhir/composition-operation-document.html</a></p>
<p>You could read the OperationDefinition as allowing a client to GET [base]/Composition/$document (without [id] and without ?id=), an thus retrieving all available Compositions and referenced resources in 1 document Bundle. Would this be allowed?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191375">@Alexander Henket</span> asked my to tag <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191505">@Sean McIlvenna</span> to perhaps look at this. Otherwise my resort would be to file a ticket at the Structured Documents Working Group.</p>
<p>Perhaps some background information: we have a use case where data is converted to FHIR, where a call of "give me all 'indicatiebesluiten'" to the database is executed, which would be all Compositions and their referenced resources - which are separate requests in FHIR as I understand it (searching GET [base]/Composition and then $document on each of the search result resources). These separate request would require the FHIR facade to store all results until the $document request has been made.</p>
<p>The $document operation isn't clear on if it is allowed to do GET [base]/Composition/$document (without any [id]) and what the result would look like. The text of the operation does say "Note that since this is a search operation, the document bundle is wrapped inside the search bundle" - which would indicatie that a searchset Bundle containing document Bundles is an option, but as the phrasing is singular it is not clear in which situation this quote applies.</p>
<p>The alternative for us would be defining a custom operation which bundles the FHIR requests into one call.</p>
