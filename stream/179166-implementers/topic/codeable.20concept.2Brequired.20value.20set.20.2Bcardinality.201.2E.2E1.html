<p>in case of codeable concept with required value set and cardinality of 1..1- the FHIR output can have at least one coding element or only one?</p>
<p>I found this in the IG, but it doesn't refer to the cardinality and its influence-<br>
<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies.html</a><br>
The following rules apply when required bindings are used with the CodeableConcept data type:<br>
at least one Coding element SHALL be present<br>
one of the Coding values SHALL be from the specified value set<br>
text can be provided as well, and is always recommended, but is not an acceptable substitute for the required code</p>

<p>You can have as many codings as you like and you can also have free text.  However you MUST have one coding that is drawn from the value set.  Cardinality says that the containing element can't be present unless the element is present (and valid).  If minOccurs was 0, then you'd be free to omit the element entirely.</p>
