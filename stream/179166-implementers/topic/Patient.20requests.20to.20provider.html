<p>What's the best resource to make a communication from a Patient to a Provider using a patient portal? The communications can either be just a bit of text ('Feeling better today doc') or a request for a repeat medication. I had thought that MedicationRequest would be best for the latter - but there are some practical issues in implementing this, so looking for a more 'generic' resource.</p>
<p>All these communications go into the providers inbox, so I'm wondering if a Task resource makes sense (after all, the provider is expected to do something with the communication - even if just to read it). Communication seems like a fit  - but it isn't supposed to represent the actual flow  - and is an 'event' rather than a 'request' in the workflow paradigm...</p>

<p>Task is appropriate if there's a request involved (particularly if a response is desired).  If it's just sharing of information - the FHIR equivalent of an email, then Communication is appropriate.</p>

<p>(Not what it was designed for, but numerous implementations have landed on it for that purpose, so I guess there's an attraction to using FHIR for secure email - rather than actually using secure email for secure email... <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> )</p>

<p>That's interesting - I interpreted the following line in the Communication scope &amp; boundary to mean that it wasn't supposed to be the actual 'message' itself. Given it's actual use by the community - perhaps that should be updated?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It does not represent the actual flow of communication</p>

<p>It can represent the flow of communication if "in progress".  I'm not sure we want to give a lot of encouragement in this space.  We definitely <em>don't</em> want it to start being used as a message wrapper.</p>
