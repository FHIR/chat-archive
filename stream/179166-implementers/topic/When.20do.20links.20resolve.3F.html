<p>First time using the FHIR chat. but seeing if i can get an answer to a question i have. I have been looking at some resources within a specification and some of the links dont resolve. for sending a fhir bundle do all the links within the resource need to resolve? and if not, why?</p>

<p>Welcome to the chat, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="456422">@Sebastian Gerhard</span>! Please start a new topic for your question (you can edit your message with a new topic).</p>
<p>Can you clarify whether your question is about links within a specification, or links within an instance of a Bundle?</p>

<p>The general rule in FHIR is that within a Bundle, links that start with urn:uuid won't resolve.  Those that start with 'http/https' SHOULD resolve.  However, lack of access permissions, temporary database issues, flaky network, server migrations, etc. might all mean that a link won't resolve.  Think of references like hyperlinks on a webpage.  Ideally, they'll resolve, but the world isn't always ideal.</p>
<p>Also, within a Bundle, sometimes links will refer to content within the Bundle and sometimes they'll refer to something outside the Bundle.  urn:uuid must always resolve within the Bundle.  However, resources with an http/https might resolve within the Bundle or RESTfully.</p>
