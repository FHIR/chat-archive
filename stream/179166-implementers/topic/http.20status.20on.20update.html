<p>from the spec:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>the server SHALL return either a 200 OK HTTP status code if the resource was updated,
or a 201 Created status code if the resource was created
</pre></div>


<p>However this doesn't say what to return if the resource was previously deleted, and it is now re-created (my server is returning 200 as it existed previously - even though it had been deleted) - which in turn fails some of the Touchstone tests.</p>

<p>My initial take on this behavior was that since the resource instance was being re-"create"d, the action was indeed a "create" and therefore a 201 Created is the expected response. Based on the specification description that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191367">@Brian Postlethwaite</span>  copied, as well as the fact that even though a resource instance is deleted it can be brought back to an existing state via the update operation, I am now inclined to expect a 200 OK or a 201 Created from this scenario. In any case as the specification does not explicitly declare one response code or the other in this scenario, I am inclined to update the Touchstone tests to accept either. Additional feedback is welcome.</p>

<p>201 is the correct response. see <a href="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13498" target="_blank" title="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13498">GF#13498</a></p>
