<p>Has there been any thought given to harmonizing photos, images, and the Media resource?  I'm seeing <code>Patient.photo</code> and <code>BodySite.image</code> as both being Attachments rather than Media.  Doesn't it at least make sense to harmonize towards <code>BodySite.photo</code> or <code>Patient.image</code>?   Also, I would have thought both <code>Patient.photo</code> and <code>BodySite.image</code> would be Media, rather than Attachment.  Or is the thinking that we're specifically including the possibility of PDFs as "photos"?</p>

<p>BodySite.image could be an xray or ultrasound image.  Patient.photo would be a photograph only.  Pointing to Media only makes sense if the element is typically treated as a stand-alone resource.  That certainly wouldn't be the case for Patient.photo.  Less sure about BodySite.image.</p>

<p>I think that clinically relevant images like BodySite.Image may have different needs than Patient.photo. I think it might make sense to consolidate them, but they have different requirements and very different use cases in my opinion</p>

<p>I hear that.  At the end of the day, though, the vast majority of DICOM images wind up being vanilla photos wrapped in a DICOM header.... photos defined by the Joint Photograph Experts Group as part of the standard, no less.  So some of these different use cases wind up in the same place, and there's less variance that it first seems.   I don't have any particular agenda here.  I was implementing a very basic Digital Avatar utility and was working with the BodySite resource, and it just seemed weird that it wasn't harmonized with the other resources.  Just giving a bit of feedback on a Maturity Level 1 resource.</p>

<p>Yes the OO and Imaging workgroups have been looking at this and will be bringing this topic up with Infrastructure and MNM.   The general consensus is that  providing clear guidelines is  between Media and Observation= valueAttachment is proving to be challenge.  We are looking at several options on how to consolidate them or at least make  sense of this.</p>

<p>I would also suggest that the X-ray or ultrasound image use cases shouldn't be handled by either an attachment or Media -- they should be handled by ImagingManifest (or potentially ImagingStudy), which is used to point to DICOM content.<br>
If you're trying to reference DICOM imaging, and these don't work, the Imaging workgroup would like to hear about why.</p>

<p>Well, if you're trying to identify a BodySite and want to include the xray or ultrasound that shows a particular fracture or tumor or whatever "inline", you might not want a separate resource.</p>

<p>there's also the thing were supporting dicom formats is 100x more expensive than png or jpg</p>

<p>If you have an X-ray or US, it will start off in DICOM format. It seems appropriate to leave it in DICOM format, and to use one of the Imaging resources. If the imaging resources aren't appropriate, please provide feedback. I'd really discourage converting an image to jpeg and them putting the jpeg in an attachment, or making multiple copies of the DICOM image. Not only is this inefficient use of your FHIR server's storage, but it causes multiple lifecycle management issues. I'd much rather see references to the DICOM content. <br>
I'd argue that DICOM is not more expensive than png or jpg. Storing information in a reliable manner, such that it can be found, retrieved and used years (or decades) later is more expensive than stuffing them in your sock drawer though. </p>

<p>Dicom won't be more expensive than PNG or JPG when there is free libraries in all the main devlopment frameworks , and when the browsers support it natively </p>

<p>I'm not saying that there's no value in DICOM, or good reasons why the support I just mentioned doesn't exist. Just that it's stupid to ignore the fact that it doesn't exist</p>

<p>and already, it is routine practice to thumbnail DICOM images to PDF, PNG or JPG and redistribute them on other channels. particularly to the patient. And it's futile to try to and change that</p>

<p>The attachment type contains all the juicy bits.  Everything else in Media is clinical context  and additional metadata  ( height, width, duration, etc)</p>
