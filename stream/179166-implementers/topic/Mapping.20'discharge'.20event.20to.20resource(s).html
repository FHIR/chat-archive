<p>Hi all... FHIR newbie here. Trying to get my head around how real-world events, such as a 'discharge' from an emergency department, is mapped to appropriate resources and operations. I assume in my example it's something to do with the embedded Hospitalisation within an Encounter,  but where does all the data that goes with the event end up? Although initially I'm asking from a data modelling perspective, at some point I'm also going to have to think how this is going to work with either or both of REST and messaging interaction models as well.</p>

<p>The primary information about the discharge would indeed appear on the Encounter - the discharging clinician, discharge date/time, discharge diagnosis, where they were discharged to, etc.  The discharge medications would be a List tied to the encounter with a List.code indicating it was a discharge medications list.  And there could be a discharge CarePlan linked to the encounter too.  If you're thinking about a "discharge summary", that would likely be a FHIR document - so a Bundle that packages all of the relevant information starting with a Composition with sections pointing to all of the above, plus a few other things too.  If you'd rather go the FHIR messaging route, a discharge message containing similar information would also be possible.</p>
