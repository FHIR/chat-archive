<p>Does it make sense for 'old' to be in the address-use valueset?  For example being able to determine an old home address from an old work address. </p>

<p>Good question - I was addressing it from a modelling perspective rather than known use cases.  But there are uses in data analysis for population health and service commissioning (anything where home address is part of the equation, e.g. Townsend score).</p>

<p>Technically, <code>(current|old)</code> is orthogonal to <code>use</code> and should, therefore, be in a separate data element.   <code>period</code> is the best place to carry this, so ideally that data element could be one of these values (perhaps in an extension) where the actual time period is not known.  That way, you could more reliably infer whether the address is current or old depending on the absence or presence of a high date/time in <code>period</code>.</p>

<p>Well obviously <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191495">@Jonny Rylands</span> does because otherwise we wouldn't even be having the discussion.  Also, AS4846 does include the concept of period of use -- which is similar -- but I would think that few systems record such data because capturing it is unreliable.  However, the knowledge of an address being old is common (and presumably why there's a use code for it), so being able to capture it independently of use would be good.  "Old" is clearly not a use of an address.  (Well. not unless you mean how my system uses the address data as opposed to how does the "owner" of the address use it, but that would be just weird.)</p>

<p>Our system only has the periods to work out what dates are applicable. We don't use old at all.<br>
Maybe I missed the explanation, the period on the address is the period that this address applies. So on the Patient record I might have 3 addresses in a year as I moved twice, including a planned move that will happen mid december (which is in the future).<br>
So when I'm planning an appointment to visit the clients home, the current address can be calculated based on the context here.</p>

<p>This is a common function of an Identity Provisioning (proofing) system; but is not an expectation of a HealthIT system. If it exists in the HealthIT, it is spotty, as it would only be addresses held while getting treatment. There is support in versions of the resource. In this regard the former addresses are relevant to healthcare as they were locations relevant to health treatment (or observations). These are commonly needed in clinical research; especially public-health research; when a regional environmental connection might have correlation or causation relationships to medical issue.  I would agree that there is sufficient support in 'versioning' for the use-cases.</p>

<p>Is "use versioning" something we're going to commonly use as a solution to a use case other than audit/forensics?  Generally, we've designed the resources to have periods/histories within the resource itself.  If there's a business case for examining version history, we've introduced the need to differentiate between real-world update and data correction and (potentially) introduced use cases for search in _history.  That's bad.</p>

<p>I'm not advocating for one approach or the other - just consistency.  It appears that we've got address.period to allow carrying previous/current/future addresses.

<p>(Just noticed that essentially the same thing was said above)</p>
<p>It would be very valuable to know that an address was a patient's home address during a particular point of time in the past, especially for identifying possible environmental issues related to health care.</p>
<p>A real life example was the recent Flint Michigan incident when people were exposed to high levels of lead in their water. Being able to identify individual(s) who lived in that area during the time frame of the incident could help to either identify people who should be monitored, or help to identify that a patient's current symptoms might be related to a known or suspected environmental incident at some time in the past.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191366">@Stephen Royce</span> FHIR isn't focused on clarity of modeling as much as it is practicality.  "Pure" modeling tends to increase complexity and cost, so it needs to be balanced against real-world needs.  If most systems don't need it and are happy with what they've got, then the few systems that do need a distinct concept are free to do so with an extension.  Profiles and implementation guides are free to nudge implementers towards the more complex solution if they wish.  (And will have more success in that nudging if there's solid use-cases behind doing it.)</p>

<p>I don't know where you get the idea that '"Pure" modeling tends to increase complexity and cost.'  That's only true of the initial development of any system.  It is well-known that the more normalised -- "purer" -- the underlying data model, the lower the long term costs of maintenance, especially adding new functionality.  The long term maintenance cost savings well outweigh the higher short term initial development costs over the lifetime of the system.</p>

<p>If you need to use a data element to hold a blend of concepts, the definition and guidance should make that clear. So defining Address.use as "The purpose of this address." is not helpful. Something like "The purpose of this address, or this address record (depending)." is more accurate.</p>

<p>Purity could easily have been achieved without the level of abstraction.  The abstraction was done to avoid the proliferation of classes and is in no way a consequence of attempting to hold to normalisation rules in the data modelling.  I say it again, decades of experience has shown that there are long term savings to be had by using properly normalised data models.  (Having said that, in practice, 4th and 5th normal form provide marginal benefit; 3rd normal form seend to be the ideal.)</p>

<p>Old is clearly not a value of use, it is a flag to indicate deprication, and in a manner which overwrites the actual use - work, home etc. So to minimize work and retain value I suggest you use the period, at whatever level of accuracy is known, and stop using 'old'.</p>

<p>"So when I'm planning an appointment to visit the clients home, the current address can be calculated based on the context here." Right, this is the opposite end of the spectrum from old - it is future - but you wouldn't want to obscure or confound your future work and home addresses by having the use of 'future' anymore than you'd want the use of 'old'. Better to keep use pure to how the party (address subject) uses that address, keep the period for those who can support, and if necessary add a status code to convey: depricated, current (active), future, entered-in-error, bad etc.</p>

<p>Often you will retain addresses so that you can accurately regenerate as at a point in time in the past, for example to re-print a bill or discharge summary, or so that you can indicate what you knew at the time. Or in Brians case above so that you can act appropriately in a future time.</p>

<p>The only thing I was suggesting is that the time status code -- not to be confused with use code -- be made an extension -- if it can't be added to the model -- and I thought inside <code>period</code> would be good, but it could just as well be a sibling.</p>

<p>Given that virtually every address will at some point become 'old' I think now is the time to make this a first-order element rather than committing us to having to use an extension 'all the time'. Also, I don't think think the code is exactly the same concept as the period.</p>

<p>Period is a view which is correct from any point in time, the code is only true currently.</p>

<p>its more like the active property in many of the administrative resources.</p>

<p>Indeed; that's a good point.  I had thought of the whole thing as "currency" which could either be a code or a period, but I like this idea.</p>
