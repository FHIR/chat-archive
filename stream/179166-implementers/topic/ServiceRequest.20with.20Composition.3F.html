<p>When sending a ServiceRequest (for eReferrals) to a target provider, it would be fairly common to want to include a PDF (or 3) in the payload (such as a completed assessment form). Note: we're using a messaging paradigm at the moment to "send" the ServiceRequest</p>
<p>Up to this point we've been focused on using ServiceRequest.supportingInfo.reference(DocumentReference) to manage the PDF file. However,  the option of using the "Composition" resource for the attachment has recently been proposed (as it is used for this purpose by a parallel "eConsult" project).</p>
<p>I haven't managed to fully get my head around Composition resource for this use case, it looks very complex to me for what we are trying to accomplish. </p>
<p>My question is: Is using DocumentReference an appropriate way to proceed to attaching PDFs to eReferrals, or should we put a strong consideration into using Composition resource for this purpose?</p>

<p>Composition is appropriate for a FHIR document but not a pdf</p>

<p>I would use docref for both</p>
