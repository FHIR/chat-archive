<p>Hello, When I store a new version of a profile on a FHIR server, what are the constraints on doing this ?<br>
1. Does the new version only allow to tighten the constrains/extensions of the last version on this server ?, or<br>
2. Is it allowed to publish completely new constrains/extensions with this version independent of the last version ?</p>
<p>If 2. were allowed, what would happen to resources stored on this server for this profile that contain fields that are no longer contained in the new version of the profile ? I tried to get the answer to this question from chapter 5.1.0 Profiling FHIR, but I am not sure about my question. I am unsure if the specification in this chapter is only about extending profile or also about publishing new versions of the same profile.<br>
Greetings</p>

<p>we don't make hard rules about this. In principle, you should think about the resources the profile describes. If you change the profile, such that the resources that conform to the profile before the change still conform  to it afterwards, then it's a new version of the same profile. If they don't... then you probably have a new profile</p>

<p>in practice, life is more complicated than that ;-)</p>
