<p>In the spec, practitionerRole has a reference to a location resource, which has an address element.  However, in some cases, this address might differ from the address we want to display for a given PractitionerRole.   If this is the case, we were thinking of adding a contained location resource with only the address element populated.  <br>
Does it make sense to have both populated on a PractitionerRole?</p>

<p>I'd recommend just creating another location with that address. In most cases there is likely more than 1 practitioner or role for the location, and would be nicer to share the location.<br>
The other consideration is searching, which is less supported on contained resources.</p>
