<p>We are using OpenEMR as our emr and also planning to expose our services as FHIR. So we have decided to use hapi code (<a href="https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir">https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir</a>) and are mapping each FHIR resource with OpenEMR tables.<br>
Query-</p>
<p>1. Do you have any suggestion for alternative to hapi server?</p>
<p>2. Since we are aiming to integrate with other EMR like nextGen, Epic, Allscript etc. Can you propose any integration tool or suggest any solution?<br>
Thanking everyone in advance.  As  I am new this chat if i am putting my query in wrong place. Please direct me ?</p>

<p>I am also using OpenEMR and HAPI.  I haven't attempted to do any integration work with them yet, but I am interested in working on the FHIR support in OpenEMR (as soon as I can find some time to spend on it).  So maybe we could collaborate on some aspects.  I think this is probably the right place in the Zulip chat for posting your questions, at least initially, although more specific questions that you may have going forward could be better suited for other streams (and you can see how that goes).  This stream is very high volume so it's rather easy for a topic with fewer responses to get buried.  I think it would be helpful if you could provide additional details and ask more specific questions (possibly in separate topics in the stream, if appropriate) in order to get discussion(s) going.</p>
