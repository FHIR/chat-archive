<p>Are there any tools you'd recommend that help compare profile differentials from one implementation guide against another implementation guide and examine the differences more fully?</p>
<p>For context, we're in the early stages of reviewing our Canadian Baseline profiles to ensure they won't cause conflicts with existing implementations that tend to be more constrained and specific in their use cases. We've been careful not to over constrain the baseline so as to avoid future issues with CA baseline-aligned vendors not being capable of conforming to other local and international profiles in use in Canada.</p>
<p>We're comparing them element by element at the moment, which seems simple enough but becomes tedious to do at scale especially as we mature and want local profilers to be able to do a quick comparison against the baseline as they work. I'm thinking it could probably be done in FHIR Validator or Forge by pointing structure definitions at the CA Baseline IGuide…but 1) I'm not sure how user friendly that would be when the profiler wants to compare a derived profile they're working on to the baseline, and 2) that approach doesn't scale nicely as a community tool if we wanted more transparency into how well other IGuides and implementations conform.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>There is profile comparison capability in the HL7 Validator.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> where is the link to the documentation for that function?</p>
