<p>I was wondering how my implementations of some low-maturity (FMM0 + 1) specifications can contribute to bumping up the maturity level of these (mostly extensions in the SDC realm, such as usageMode). I am aware of the description at <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/versions.html#maturity">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/versions.html#maturity</a> and the following:<br>
<em>The maturity model is significantly influenced by the degree and type of implementation activity using an artifact. For this reason, we encourage implementers to register their implementations . A detailed analysis of the basis for the maturity metrics for FHIR artifacts can be found here .</em></p>
<p>However, both the registration link and the maturity metrics link are broken. Are implementations still being tracked and is this the way how to mature a spec? Or would I need to participate in a Connectathon and show it off?</p>

<p>We're just <em>starting</em> to track maturity at the implementation guide level.  For the pending release of SDC, most content will be marked as level 2, with net new things marked as 0 (draft).  One of my objectives for next year's release is to gather more information about usage so we can nudge the maturity of somethings up to the 4/5 level.</p>
