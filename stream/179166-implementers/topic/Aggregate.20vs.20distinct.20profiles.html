<p>Hi,<br>
I was looking for some insight as to cases when one would put together an profile package (such as vital signs, QICore, or DAF) compared to distinct profiles? Does the existing tooling support building such packages?<br>
From what I understand, in the case of the vital signs profile, this is when then a profile (e.g. BMI) must conform to two sets of profiles:<br>
1) the parent profile - it. must conform to all the criteria of the vital signs profile<br>
2) a specific profile - it must also conform to additional constraints as part of the BMI profile specifically<br>
Does this differ from just building these profiles independently but still authoring it such that the profile has both sets of constraints?<br>
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>The main reason for deriving one profile from another is to simplify maintenance.  If you update the parent profile, those changes will automatically ripple down into the chlidren.   (Note that profile dependency is independent from profile packaging - packaging is purely a question of how you want to publish things.</p>
