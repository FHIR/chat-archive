<p>The main point of this questions involves dealing with versioning, but I also have some smaller questions I hope someone will have the answers to.</p>
<p>Currently I have a patient intake form being saved in the QuestionnaireResponse resource, and I plan to map the answers to the correct resources. However, I have some questions that don't fit in the general resource I'm mapping to e.g. no SSN (or TIN) field in RelatedPerson resource when the patient intake question asks for Insurance holder's SSN. (1) Do I just leave this in the questionnaireResponse, and retrieve it as needed? Or is there a way to add a field (extension) to the resource where the rest of the question is being saved to?</p>
<p>The versioning issue: I haven't been able to find v4.0.1 resource for all the questions, for example employment history. I was able to find the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/2018May/occupationaldata.html">OccupationalData</a> for v3.3.0, but wasn't sure if I could use it. I found some documentation that said I could but would have to include the version number in the url. (2) Before I did that I was wondering if there <strong>was</strong> actually a resource for employer name, employment history etc. in v4 that I was missing or a way to add it. (3) And if there isn't, is the only thing I need to do for different versions just adding the version number in the url or do I need to create a resource like <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html">CapabilityStatement</a>. </p>
<p>Thank You!</p>

<p>Please let me know if there is something I can add to make this question more clear, or if I should post it in a different thread! Thank you!!</p>

<p>you can add extensions, but you should look at <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/odh/">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/odh/</a></p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to me <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> , I've been looking into the documenatation you sent and am still having trouble figuring out how I would properly use it. I am new to FHIR, and am wondering how use the IG and the profile it's describing. Do I just create a resource called ODH?</p>

<p>no it tells you how to use Observations for what you want to do</p>

<p>Ok thanks, I had a hard time seeing how it related to Observation initially. Thanks for setting me down the right path.</p>

<p>And one last question about the versioning. Is it required? If I try to use all v4 resources (or if I don't), am I required to make a CapabilityStatement and add versions to all the resources, so there is backward compatibility in the future (e.g. v5). Thanks again : - )</p>

<p>I took a look at versioning <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/versioning.html">documentation</a> so if I had some resources that were a different version would they be considered a 'naked resource' and I would just include the version as a field. Otherwise if it's all the same version just create a CapabilityStatement is that correct?</p>

<p>I'm not sure I understand that question - which specific elements are you talking about?</p>

<p>The section is speaking about how one addresses a server that might be supporting more than one version of FHIR.  This is an issue when the resource you are addressing is not normative. As prior to normative there can be radical differences in the resource layout. Thus as you look at a resource, you need to know which version of FHIR standard was used to encode it so that you can decompose it as intended.   <br>
The statement about 'naked' is a statement that sometimes there is not context around an exchange that would hint as to what the version of FHIR standard was used, but these are rare.  A server endpoint would be serving up ONE version of FHIR standard. They would not be returning some using STU3 and others R4.<br>
No idea what the question is around CapabilityStatement</p>
