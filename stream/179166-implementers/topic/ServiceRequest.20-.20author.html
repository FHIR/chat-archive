<p>I wonder why a ServiceRequest does not have an author? For the cases where the serviceRequest-record is not filled by the requester. <br>
Consider the case, where a relative calls some home care coordination center to request a service. The requester is the RelatedPerson, but the Practioner that recieved the call, and filled in the record, where does that go?<br>
I know I could use Provenance, but I wonder if there is another solution, that does not require implementers to look outside the ServiceRequest itself?<br>
Could I use the "directedBy" extension (the description of its use is quite limited)?</p>

<p>The 'requester' is the individual with responsibility for the request.  Typically if a patient asks for a referral, the practitioner who fills it out is still the individual with the 'responsibility'.  The fact the patient asked for it is either implicit or would be captured via Provenance.  Similarly, it a physician authorized a referral, but a nurse filled out the forms, the nurse's role as "data enterer" would also be captured using Provenance.</p>
