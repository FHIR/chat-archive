<p>I need to use the FHIR standard profiles Body weight and Bodu height for my project and I wonder why they have attibutes like 'Speciman' and  'Body part' which do not have any conection to those two parameters.</p>

<p>so far, we've concentrated on saying as little as possible in those globally applicable profiles, only what is needed to create minimum interoperability. it seems likely to me that given enough consideration, we could start ruling out elements that are not appropriate like the ones you mention. It would be appropriate for you to create tasks asking the committee to consider this. (Note, though, that everything about these profiles is super hard work, so it may not be resolved quickly)</p>
