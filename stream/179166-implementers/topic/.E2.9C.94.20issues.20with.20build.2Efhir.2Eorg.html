<p>Hi, I'm new here, sorry if it is not the good place to ask this kind of question, since few days, all IGs in <a href="http://build.fhir.org">build.fhir.org</a> are no more accessible, do you have any idea about the issue and if it is currently being addressed ? many thanks in advance</p>

<p>All of the continuous integration builds got wiped if they hadn't changed recently.  The will only come back if/when someone runs a continuous build for the relevant IG.  All of the 'official' releases should still be there.  We've changed processes to ensure this doesn't happen to the main builds of HL7-published IGs going forward.  It will still happen to IGs published by others though unless they've communicated with HL7 that they want their builds protected as well.</p>

<p>it was a long planned system upgrade to trim old versions, and when we specced it out, we didn't think through all the ramifications</p>
