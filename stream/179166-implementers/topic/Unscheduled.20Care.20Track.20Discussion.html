<p>This is a discussion stream for the Unscheduled Care Track proposed for January 2017.</p>
<p>Hello, FHIR implementers,</p>
<p>One of the thoughts my team and I walked away with from our first Connectathon (in September) was that it would be beneficial to try out a few workflows specific to the emergency medicine/urgent care domain in the next Connectathon.  We worked with the Emergency Medicine WG and submitted a proposal. It is available at <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201701_Unscheduled_Care" target="_blank" title="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201701_Unscheduled_Care">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201701_Unscheduled_Care</a>.  I wanted to see if these workflows resonate with others here and who would be interested in participating in such a track at the January Connectathon.  Please reply to this if you're interested or email me - svoicucomendant at tsystem dot com. Thank you!</p>
