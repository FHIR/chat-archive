<p>The fhir spec says " Version-specific references should remain as version-specific references after the references have been updated". Can I get more clarification on this? Does this mean when a resource is updated, then all the version specific reference should update their version to the updated version of that resource?</p>

<p>It means that after you execute the create or update for the resource and know what the id and version is on the new system, you change the reference to point to that specific version</p>

<p>Spec also specifies the transaction processing rules. <br>
Process any DELETE interactions<br>
Process any POST interactions<br>
Process any PUT or PATCH interaction.</p>
<p>I am trying to address the following situation. I have a resource within a bundle that needs to be created and has a versioned reference that is pointing to a resource that needs to be updated. Here, the resource that needs to created  cannot obtain a updated version of referenced resource within a transaction due to the processing rules stated above, as POST is always executing before PUT. Are these two rules contradicting with each other?</p>

<p>Nope.  You're going to have to do the create, then the update, then fix the reference.</p>
