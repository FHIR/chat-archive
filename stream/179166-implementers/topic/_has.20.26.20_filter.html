<p>While answering the question in the "Search _has not " thread, I was trying to use _filter to solve the search request.  Now with "_" allowed as nameCharStart, _has could be used in such a query. Yet, I don't see a way of using it, because in my opinion a ":"  would still be rejected by the grammar?  Would it make sense to extend paramPath in such a way that it allows a inline "[filter]" incl. chaining or a ":" for using reverse chaining?</p>
