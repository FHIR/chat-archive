<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I'm looking for a resource to explicit that a Practitioner have the access right to all data about an organization (associated Patients, Encounters...).<br>
According to you, what's the best method to implement the information "the Practitioner have access to Organization A and Organization B associated data" ?</p>
<p>We had multiple ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>use PractitionerRole to say that practitioner have an access to an organization</li>
<li>use Group to list the practitioners that are allowed to access data from an organization</li>
<li>use Consent resource</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>The Consent resource has this in scope, where the subject is the practitioner. This was a 'feature' added with some use-cases around provider directories. It doesn't 'feel right' as there is no consent act, and likely has nothing to do with consent.</p>
<p>So, we are working on a more generalized resource in R5 - Permission. It is developing slowly due to many other things the people interested are working on. That said, it can develop much faster with resources. What we first need is explicitly defined use-cases, and examples of how that use-case might look given the Permission resource. Following that would be adjustments to the model. We know of a few adjustments driven by some use-cases. So, please feel free to help develop this for R5.</p>

<p>Th Consent resource has that in it's use cases.  Australia used Consent for their practitioner database.  By using a custom Consent.scope and setting the subject to Practitioner, you can use that exact information</p>

<p>Thanks for your answer :)<br>
The use case is to create a tool to search for patient and visualise patient hospital journey, the goal was to limit the practitioner access to his organization and all related resources.<br>
Finally, we decided to use PractitionerRole, which says like "he has a research role on this organization and have the right to access data". We will then adapt the implementation with the R5 Permission resource when released.</p>
