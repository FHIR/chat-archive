<p>After some more discussion on this where Contract also was flagged as an option, our recommendation is Flag resource. The codes in the value set is conveying exceptions to the normal clinical practice workflow which seem to suit "A flag is typically presented as a label in a prominent location in the record to notify the clinician of the potential issues". Codes in the value set include the patient can meet up directly at the hospital instead the normal procedure of going through ER/GP; a special doctor should be contacted if something happens to the patient (to prevent ex ER to start some treatment on their own), or based on experience a special way of treatment (which is not the standard way) is recommended for the given patient. Let us know if Flag is not the best resource for this.</p>

<p>For the last, you might look at a managed DetectedIssue.  The other two seem reasonable for Flag.</p>
