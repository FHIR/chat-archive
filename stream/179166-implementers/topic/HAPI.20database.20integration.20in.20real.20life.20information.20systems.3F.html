<p>I'm reading up on HAPI FHIR Server. What is unclear to me is how it is integrated  in "real life". Does it use its own database, to store FHIR resource data, and this data is then "synced" to a healthcare record platform, or does the model data come from a bridge/connector, which translates HIS data into FHIR resources at every request? <br>
Am I right to assume, that when a clinic provides an HAPI FHIR server, the data is not read-only, but (at least in principle) can be written/updated/deleted?</p>

<p>If you're planning to use HAPI as an interface to an existing system, most commonly you'd re-write the persistance layer to read and write to your existing database, though a bridge/connector model is also a potential strategy.  That does make writes more complex though.</p>

<p>Their are a number of HAPI servers, what you are referring to is the HAPI JPA Server. Another is the HAPI RESTful server <a href="http://hapifhir.io/doc_rest_server.html" target="_blank" title="http://hapifhir.io/doc_rest_server.html">http://hapifhir.io/doc_rest_server.html</a> , we used this for our system (so we use our own database, like HAPI JPA we use Hibernate/JPA for data access)</p>
