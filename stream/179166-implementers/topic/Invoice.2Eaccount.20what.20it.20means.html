<p>What means Invoice.account? I think it is the account is going to pay the invoice but i am not sure. If it is we don't know what is the account is going to be used then we need to update the invoice when it is paid, is it the correct flow or is it mean other thing?</p>

<p>It is the account that will be 'paid' by the Invoice.  I.e. when the money comes in, what account will it help to settle?  Generally most systems don't know or care where the money will come from, only where the money will go to.</p>
