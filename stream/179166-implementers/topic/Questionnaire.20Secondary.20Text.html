<p>In DSTU-2, we (ab)used the <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/extension-questionnaire-instruction.html</code> extension for secondary text on a question or group/display items. For example in our SF-36 implementation, the <code>text</code>  would simply say “Vigorous Activities”. Then we'd have the instruction extension to say “such as running, lifting heavy objects, participating in strenuous sports” (and render this in smaller font right under the question).</p>
<p>This extension has gone away in STU-3 and it seems the idea is to nest another <code>display</code> type item to achieve this behavior, correct? This could be workable, but it seems that having a primary and a secondary text element on questionnaire items is rather common – the <code>text</code> element is already labeled “primary text”. I'm wondering if there should be a core element so that an item can have primary and secondary text. Could be <code>title</code> and <code>text</code>, which would demote text to secondary, or an additional element like <code>details</code>. Thoughts?</p>

<p>There's a whole bunch of different types of nested display possible - secondary text, instructions, units, etc.  I don't think any one of those is "more" core than the others, nor do I think that any of them fall within the 80%.</p>
