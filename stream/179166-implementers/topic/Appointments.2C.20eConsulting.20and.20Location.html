<p>Suppose I'm booking an appointment for an eConsult: how do I convey the virtual location of that? In our use case we assume a URI to exist as starting point. This could be a webex/skype/zoom/fcc/http link.</p>
<p>Appointment could have a .participant.actor Location or HealthcareService that describes the virtual service. HealthcareService relies on Location for the actual 'address'. </p>
<p>Location is scoped to be a physical location, which seems to contradict the virtual notion of an eConsult. My initial leaning goes towards Location.telecom nonetheless.</p>
<p>Help appreciated. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191367">@Brian Postlethwaite</span>?</p>

<p>You're right there. The location has indeed been scoped to physical, the only wiggle room in the definition is jurisdiction, but that's not what you're after.<br>
I thought it wasn't so tight, but that's what it is.<br>
Healthcare servo e is feeling better, and would suggest an endpoint for the details of the service.<br>
Could even schedule the HCS.<br>
Dont need to have the location on the HCS if not needed.</p>

<p>Thanks. HealthcareService.endpoint is 0..*, so presumably when I want to say "please log in at this endpoint" I would have to make sure that my HealthcareService instance has a 1..1 connection to Endpoint.</p>
<p>Would scheduling an EndPoint actor directly from Appointment not make more sense? If you feel it deserves some discussion I could file a tracker for it?</p>

<p>Specify which type of endpoint rather than constraing the reference.</p>

<p>Healthcare services should have lots for various purposes.</p>
