<p>When a physician generates a Referral for the patient to see a Specialist, how should the request and fulfillment be mapped?  Should the request be mapped to resourceServiceRequest?  what about the fulfillment of the request when the referral is being accepted by the specialist?  Please advise, thanks.</p>

<p>The referral is a ServiceRequest (in R4), the fulfillment I am not sure - probably an Encounter</p>

<p>The ServiceRequest represents the authorization for service.  Task is intended to be used for the process of asking someone to satisfy the referral (and is where you would capture the acceptance/refusal).  It also allows linking the results to the request (interim or final).  The result from a referral could be a variety of things.  Most common, I think would be some sort of report - possibly a DocumentReference or a DiagnosticReport instance.  But could also point to a Procedure, an Encounter or various other things.</p>
