<p>The issue we are having is that, while some of our "partitions" within our systems may have a specific OID connected to them (which then it is pretty simply "system": "urn:oid:PARTITION.OID" in FHIR), some do not, and especially if it is the only partition on a patient, we may still want to include it in the identifiers.</p>
<p>Is there any "format" that would support being able to communicate the internal "partition code", along with just the system OID itself.  </p>
<p>Thinking something like "urn:oid:SYSTEM.OID/PARTITION_CODE", but, guessing that isn't too kosher.</p>
<p>Just wondering if there is a solution, outside of just not including partitions that aren't given a distinct OID.</p>

<p>To clarify, you're wanting a Patient instance (and perhaps other resource instances) to include an identifier for the partition they're part of that's unique to the partition, not the patient?</p>

<p>To maybe be more precise:<br>
<code>
{
resourceType: "Patient",
id: "18",
identifier: [
    {
        use: "usual",
        type: {
        coding: [
            {
                system: "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203",
                code: "MR"
            }
            ],
            text: "Record Number-MIE Test Patients"
        },
        system: "urn:oid:1.2.840.114398.1.668/MIE",
        value: "10019"
    }
],
.....
</code><br>
I'm not even really sure that having the text for what our "personal use" of the code is is accurate/correct in the "coding" block, that maybe should just be "Medical Record Number"(?).<br>
"1.2.840.114398.1.668" is the system this patient is in's OID.<br>
"MIE" is the "partition name" for the partition,  "Record Number-MIE Test Patients" is the description of the partition.  The identifier within that partition is 10019.  So, the internal "MR Number" is "MIE-10019". <br>
As stated, in this case, the system hasn't given the partition a defined OID.</p>
<p>Again, I don't think what I am doing here is likely also advised or permitted in FHIR (the "/MIE"), though if I'm wrong on that, great.  So, looking for any solutions, if any are possible, for communicating "non-externally OIDed" internal partitions.</p>

<p>Throwing "/MIE" on the end of an OID is definitely not allowed (in FHIR, v2, CDA or any other circumstance).  What I'm trying to understand is how "MIE" relates to the base OID of 1.2.840.114398.1.668.  Is there a reason to not sent "MIE-10019" as the medical record number?  There's no requirement that it actually be a "number".</p>

<p>Would recording urn:oid:1.2.840.114398.1.668 for the system, and MIE for the assigned work? Or why bother with using the oid at all? Use a url that ends in the partition.</p>

<p>Lloyd/Elliot.</p>
<p>That makes some sense... system being the system OID (system: "urn:oid:1.2.840.114398.1.668") and "value" being "MIE-10019".  I think that will likely work the best for this scenario.  Thanks.</p>
