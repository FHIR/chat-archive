<p>Hello everyone. I have started the journey of implementing FHIR into an existing mental health care application. One of the things I'm struggling with is how to go about representing a treatment protocol as well as the tooling that would need to be involved in orchestrating workflows. So far, I've been investigating BPMN+ integrating with FHIR in some way. Wondering what the guidance is out there for how everyone else is representing their workflows.</p>

<p>The FHIR workflow project has had a number of discussions about the relationship between BPMN and FHIR.  The resources you want are PlanDefinition and ActivityDefinition.  You might want to raise detailed questions here: <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179196" href="/#narrow/stream/179196-workflow">#workflow</a></p>
