<p>Hi all, <br>
I need to create Episode of care Definitions which was taken from <a href="http://www.prometheusanalytics.net/deeper-dive/concepts-and-use" target="_blank" title="http://www.prometheusanalytics.net/deeper-dive/concepts-and-use">http://www.prometheusanalytics.net/deeper-dive/concepts-and-use</a>. We want to capture these metadata (Trigger codes, Typical Diagnosis Codes, Typical Procedure Codes, Potentially Avoidable Complication Codes, Prescription Codes, Subtypes, Global E&amp;Ms, Universal Risk Factors). Can anyone suggest me.<br>
Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span> do we have anything in this space yet?  It seems like a cross between decision support and a "ConditionDefinition"</p>

<p>Looking at the documentation there, the criteria could certainly be captured with trigger definitions and libraries of criteria for what constitutes a particular episode. The question for me is what you want those definitions to actually do? Would they create the EpisodeOfCare that wrapped the relevant data elements? Or would it only be used as criteria for additional analytics and reporting downstream?</p>

<p>Yes <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span> There are 98 Episode of care definitions.<br>
For example, Episode of care of Asthma includes the following core components<br>
Trigger codes<br>
SubTypes<br>
Relevant Diagnosis<br>
Relevant Procedures<br>
Relevant Pharmacy <br>
SubType Groups.<br>
Which resource is best to use to capture all these information?</p>

<p>Hi all, we want to create library entity for reference purpose ,can we use Fhir structures for that?<br>
In that library we want Episode of care type,status,managing organization, triggering event(diagnosis | procedures ),code diagnosis,Potential avoidable complication.<br>
we want to load  this information in to  Fhir server . This Episode of care is  create an entity to what we are creating is library,the Fhir library resource is different ,so we can't combine both of them.<br>
Suggest me to ,can we create a standard structure for this information ?</p>

<p>It sounds like you're trying to define a "definition" for an EpisodeOfCare.  Have you looked at PlanDefinition?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="212752">@Surya</span> can you give an example? <br>
for triggering event you have plandefinition.action.trigger .<br>
for potential avoidable complication - could PlanDefinition.goal cover it? (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span> )</p>

<p>Thank you <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> <br>
 For example,we have a diagnosis AcuteMyocardialInfarction which will includes triggering codes,DRG codes,typical diagnosis codes,potentially avoidable complication codes ,procedure codes and cpt/hcpcs codes.How to capture all these codes?</p>

<p>oh then it starts looking like something other than a plandefinition</p>

<p>What you're describing sounds more complex than any single resource. PlanDefinition would be capable of structuring the information about what triggers the episode of care, and what the patterns are that should be used to capture the episode of care. I'm not clear on potentially avoidable complication, what would that look like in the actual episode of care?</p>

<p>Anyone out there have a need to use an EpisodeOfCare compartment, or $everything operation, just as we have with Encounter to be able to get all the related material associated with an EpisodeOfCare</p>

<p>I long for when we do have the need - as I think it makes sense.  But I don't think episodes are in wide use.  It may be that GraphDefinition will eliminate the need, but I can see potential use for "give me the record for pregnancy x"</p>

<p>Personally I'm still baffled as to why we have the concept of Compartments at all. And yes, I've read its definition. But still I don't see the use case where this would be commonly used. <br>
Re this discussion: GraphDefinition sounds to me like the thing one would like to use. It's either the client or the server who'll have to express "THIS (subset, graph) is what I'm looking for".</p>

<p>For me it's the definition of what resource types to include in the $everything operation.</p>
