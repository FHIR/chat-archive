<p>In the documentation for <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/procedure.html">Procedures</a>, it's mentioned that a Patient can perform a Procedure on themselves. Additionally, in ServiceRequests's, there is an <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/servicerequest-example4.json.html">example</a> of a ServiceRequest requesting "Bench presses". It's not mentioned in the example what the context for this ServiceRequest is (e.g. is this part of physio?).</p>
<p>Together, these make me wonder when it's appropriate to use a ServiceRequest to request a Patient do something for themself versus using a Task. For concreteness, let's say I want a Patient to walk 4km. When should I use a ServiceRequest to request this and when should I use a Task?</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>ServiceRequest allows you to ask for something to happen on a repeated basis.  E.g. "Walk 4 km 3 times/week for the next month".  It also allows specifying method, bodySite and other details.  Task only allows asking for one instance.  Task is frequently tied to a particular order.  E.g. you might have an order that specifies details and authorizes many repetitions.  But you'd have a Task that reminded you (and tracked execution) of the repetition you're supposed to do today.</p>

<p>I see. Tell me if the conclusion I have reached is incorrect. Tasks can be used to capture pretty basic Requests, lacking a lot of detail. In the situation where I only want to ask the Patient to walk 4km once and don't need to specify any other detail beyond that, I _could_ use a Task or ServiceRequest. However, using a Task is quite limiting and if I want to make a richer Request, then ServiceRequest is the way to go.</p>

<p>Task lets you assign a specific scheduled to-do item with limited detail.  ServiceRequest allows requesting a repeating activity and provide more detail.  In may cases, you'll have both.  An overall 'order' and then daily "check-list" items</p>
