<p>Can Questionnaire resource, which is referring to  CQL functions to get the answers, capture/refer to the FHIR resource(s) or supporting documentation/document links for supporting the evaluated answers? Like xray document or Problem/Condition resource.</p>

<p>Questionnaire is generally not patient-specific or time-specific, so it would be unusual for it to be tied to patient-specific resources (though for a Patient-specific form where every patient gets asked different questions, I guess it's possible).  It would make more sense for a QuestionnaireResponse to point to the resources that the answers were derived from.  There isn't currently a way to do that, but feel free to submit a change request adding at least a standard extension for doing so.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  for your response. Yes, it makes more sense for QuestionnaireResponse to point to the resources but that should be driven by the Questionnaire like these are my questions and send me the responses with supporting docs or Resources. In order for this, the Questionnaire should also have a place holder for it, either native or extension. What's your thought on that?</p>

<p>You can have a 'question' item of type Reference - that will allow the answer to be a pointer to a resource (or set of resources) from the record.</p>

<p>You can also design a Questionnaire to allow data from the EHR to be used to populate answers to questions in the QuestionnaireResponse - take a look at the Structured Data Capture implementation guide.</p>

<p>Thank you. Let me have a look and come back, in case I still have doubt or issue around it.</p>

<p>Wasn't there an operation on QuestionnaireResponse where you could pass a Questionnaire (and patient id) and ask for the QR to be generated from existing data?</p>

<p>[This is how the EPR I worked with in the 90's worked. The template would be pre-populated with existing data and users would amend or fill in the gaps]</p>

<p>Yes.  This operation was moved to the SDC implementation guide on the grounds that SDC provides considerable guidance about how to actually execute the operation and define Questionnaires in a way that can be used with it.</p>
