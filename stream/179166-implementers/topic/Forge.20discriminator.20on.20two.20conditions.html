<p>I have a situation where an Observation can contain components for two separate reasons. One is that the measurement is a compound (such as a Blood Pressure measurement). If there is a compound, Observation.value[x] and Observation.dateAbsentReason will not exist. However there are also a cases where there will be components describing extra information for both the compound case and non compound case. I am not sure how to slice this condition and/or even represent it. Any ideas?</p>

<p>I don't understand what you mean by "compound case".  Do you mean using components?  Slicing can help you sort out what the different components are but is sounds like you have a different use in mind....</p>
