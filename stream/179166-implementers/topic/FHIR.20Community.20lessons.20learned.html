<p>For those of you also implementing HL7v2 or CDA:<br>
The HL7 AID working group (the wider Implementers Community for all HL7 standards, not just FHIR) is looking to plow back some of the lessons learned around FHIR to the other/older HL7 standards. Just to give a few examples:<br>
-Have a Zulip for HL7v2 and/or CDA implementers (based on the success of this forum)<br>
-Create implementation oriented bundles for the v2 and CDA specifications (include APIs, software processable specifications, plenty of valid examples, etc. - as FHIR does it). See <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Implementation_Packages" target="_blank" title="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Implementation_Packages">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Implementation_Packages</a> , this has been discussed in the past as well.</p>
<p>Anything else? That's where you come in: what 'FHIR lesson learned' would be nice to apply to HL7v2 and CDA, to make it easier to implement those HL7 standards ?</p>
