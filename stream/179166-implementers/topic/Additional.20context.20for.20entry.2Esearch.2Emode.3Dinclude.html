<p>Thinking about adding an extension on <a href="http://Bundle.entry.search">Bundle.entry.search</a> with additional context for include/revinclude results. Currently there's no way to tell by looking at the entry which resource(s) it is associated with, whether it was a forward or reverse include, etc.</p>
<p>Has anyone created similar extensions for this? I'm happy to be consistent if there's already a pattern out there.</p>

<p>Would be good to take this up in FHIR-I as core extensions. (It's interesting/tricky as all of these might need to be repeating params, since individual resources can be included for more than one reason; currently we punt on this at the top level for mode, with "There is only one mode. In some corner cases, a resource may be included because it is both a match and an include. In these circumstances, 'match' takes precedence.")</p>

<p>Keep in mind that a single resource could, theoretically,  be an _include from multiple resources in the page and could even be an _include for some and a _revinclude for others - or in odd cases, could be an _include and _revinclude for the same resource.  Also, this is redundant with just looking at the references in the resource, so not sure how much it'd be buying?</p>

<p>Our experience has been that although the client <em>can</em> figure it out (especially in specific use cases), in the general case it takes a fair amount of effort. There are a bunch of references in the resources, each of which may or may not be involved. You can't tell the difference between an include and a revinclude, so you have to look for both connections. With :iterate there could be a whole graph of links.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the server - at least for our implementation - knows most of this information explicitly while it's constructing the results, and could easily record it.</p>

<p>What action would be taken based on whether it was an _include or _revinclude?</p>

<p>It determines which resource's references the client needs to search through to figure out where the link was.</p>
