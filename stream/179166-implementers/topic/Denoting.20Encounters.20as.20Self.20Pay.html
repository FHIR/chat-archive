<p>Sorry if this has been asked before,  but has anyone tackled flagging Encounters in FHIR as Self Pay without extending the Resource?  I've been looking through the Standard to see a spot where an encounter could be denoted with this information and haven't had much luck.  I'm interested in labeling these encounters where a patient paid out of pocket for the services to establish Access Controls to who can see resources associated to this encounter.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Encounter has a reference to Account, which is where you describe that an encounter was covered under a self-pay arrangement</p>
