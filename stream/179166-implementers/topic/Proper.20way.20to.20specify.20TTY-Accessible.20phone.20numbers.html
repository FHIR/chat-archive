<p>We're trying to find a way to specify a TTY service for telecom. There is no ContactPoint .system for TTY, so I think we need to create an extension.</p>
<p>We can think of two ways to approach it... what would be the correct/preferred way?</p>
<p>1. Add an isTTY boolean extension, which means the phone number is to be considered a TTY service.<br>
2. Create an extension called TTYValue of type valueString, which would contain the phone number for the TTY service. This would take priority over the telecom.value field.</p>
<p>We're leaning towards option 1 at the moment...</p>

<p>Agree that option 1 is appropriate and sounds like a good candidate for a standard extension</p>

<p>I'm sure we discussed this in the past. So I find <a href="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=6089" target="_blank" title="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=6089">GF#6089</a> - which said that we would create a new task for dealing with hearing impaired requirements, which I failed to do. So it fell in a hole. what requirements are there beyond TTY? Someone I know personally who is connected to the hearing impaired community told me that TTY is falling out of use now that there's so many options... but I don't know if that's reflective of the wider situation...?</p>

<p>I would also suggest that these fit into the extension space under other.</p>

<p>We ended up creating a BooleanType, with value set to true, which we apply to the ContactPoint resource. We only add the extension when our telecom resource isTTY = true.</p>
<p>We set our ContactPoint.system = "OTHER", and our ContactPoint.use = "WORK".</p>
<p>We also looked at that option <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193933">@Benjamin Flessner</span> , but the extension seems the best fit for an easy solution. Definitely would prefer TTY as a valueset option, OR the "other" be redefined, as "A contact that is not a phone" is restrictive in this instance.</p>
