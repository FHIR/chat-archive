<p>Hi,<br>
I'm an intern at the moment and am tasked with looking into storing time series data for HL7. The idea is to store hourly heart rate data obtained from a smart watch, consisting of a double for each hour, and then to do that over the course of multiple days. I'm aware that HL7 isn't intended to store time series, but what would be the most efficient workaround for it at the moment?</p>

<p>HL7 doesn't store data at all, regardless of time series or not. HL7 defines how data is exchanged.<br>
It sounds like you are obtaining Observations. You can store into your system as many observations as you want as frequent as you want. When you do so, just think about what you have to populate into an HL7 interface so you know what to store. A unique id value per Observation, when, the value, who/what measured it, etc.</p>

<p>Gotcha, thanks for clearing up that misunderstanding! That makes my job significantly easier :)</p>

<p>Within Observation, you <em>could</em> look at using the SampledData data type, but for something that's done once an hour, separate Observations is probably better</p>
