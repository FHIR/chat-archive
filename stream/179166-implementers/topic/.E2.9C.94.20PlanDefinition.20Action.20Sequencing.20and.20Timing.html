<p>Consider a PlanDefinition with two actions:</p>
<p>[{"id": "0000", "relatedAction": [{"relationship": "before", "actionId": "0001"}]}, {"id": "0001", "relatedAction":  [{"relationship": "after", "actionId": "0001"}], "timingDuration": {"value": 30, "unit": "minutes", "system": " <a href="http://unitsofmeasure.org">http://unitsofmeasure.org</a>", "code": "min"}}]</p>
<p>My intent is to that this says that action 0000 should be completed before action 0001 and that the party doing this action has 30 minutes to complete action 0001. Is this correct? I'm thinking this could also be interpreted as the action 0001 will take 30 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>For example, action 0001 could be send an email, in which case this says that the party doing this action needs to send it out within 30 minutes of completing task 0000. Or would this be interpreted as the party will spend 30 minutes writing an email?</p>
