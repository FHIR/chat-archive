<p>Dear all, </p>
<p>for each encounter we persist all patient-movements to retrospectively make evaluation on that data. Within that, we would like to be able to know, if a certain location was an ICU, or a 'regular ward' within a given period of time (namely the stay of a certain patient on that very ward). We do have that data within our clinical systems, but do not know, how to model it in FHIR.</p>
<p>Is there already a way, to do this? ( We stumbled over the resource-history on the FHIR-server as well, but that seems not to be what we want, as it does only tell, when a change is made public to the server. )</p>
<p>If not, something similar to the structure of Encounter.participant would be amazing in our opinion, since it contains exactly the type as well as the period for which that type is applicable.</p>
<p>Christoph</p>

<p>Not sure this is the best answer to your question: first of all: Location is a physicial location, not its role (which is in Organization) . </p>
<p>You could use enconter.partOf to create a child-encounter per 'movement'. partOf partly exists because of the difference in granularity of encounters in various jurisdictions, some see a hospital-encounter as an encounter, others see a ward-encounter as an encounter. </p>
<p>If that doesn't work you may wish to go for an extension.</p>
