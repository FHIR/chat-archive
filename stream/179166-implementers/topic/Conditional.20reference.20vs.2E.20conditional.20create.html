<p>I'm trying to understand the situations in which it's appropriate to use a conditional reference vs. a conditional create.  My understanding thus far is that conditional reference is used when you want the transaction to fail if the reference doesn't resolve to a single resource, whereas conditional create is used when you want the resource to be created if it doesn't resolve (and only error if there's multiple matches).</p>
<p>On a transaction with a conditional create, when you get back a 200, do you also get back the URL of the created resource?  (I suppose at minimum you'd get back the URL if you received back a copy of the created resource that referenced the conditonally created resource?)</p>

<p>the transaction response includes an entry for each entry in the request that includes that information</p>

<p>So the 200 entry would include the fullUrl for the existing resource if the if-none-exist evaluated to a resource instead of an empty set?  Is that something that's clarified in the spec (and if not, should I submit a change request to clarify it?)</p>
