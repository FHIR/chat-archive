<p>I'm looking to model some Newborn birth details including the identifier of the mother. I've noticed in the STU3 Ballot there's advice on how to do this (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2016Sep/patient.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/2016Sep/patient.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/2016Sep/patient.html</a>).  The difference between DSTU2 and STU3 is that in STU3 the Patient.link.other attribute allows a Reference to RelatedPerson (but I could use a DSTU2 extension to cover this). The only data item I need about the mother is her identifier (in our case the NHS Number). As the focus is on the child, rather then the mother, I'm not sure that creating an Encounter for the mother and an Encounter for the newborn and linking them by Encounter.partof is the right thing to do? The other advice on linking the two Patient records is then via RelatedPerson, where I create a Patient resource for the newborn, a Patient resource for the mother &amp; link them using relatedPerson - with a link from the newborn Patient to the RelatedPerson resource, which references the mother's Patient resource (where the mother's identifier is found). Is this the right thing to do, have others modelled mother to newborn relationship in any other way?</p>

<p>well, you should follow STU3 recommendations in DSTU2, with extensions where necessary</p>
