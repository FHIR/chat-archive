<p>Is there any guidance which specifies major FHIR implementations/APIs and the FHIR versions supported? <br>
This would be helpful in determining the trade-offs in adopting various versions and the feasibility of interoperability with different systems. </p>
<p>For instance, suppose I want to implement a CDS Hook which run HEDIS CQL compliance algorithms, then launches a smart app which connects to CMS Bluebutton and Apple health kit. <br>
(That might not be a valid scenario, but for illustrative purposes). <br>
To begin to evaluate that I need to understand which versions of FHIR are supported by the various entities/libraries/etc. involved. </p>
<p>Do we have a community wiki of any sort for this?</p>
