<p>Hi all,<br>
in a hospital setting I want to capture that a diagnosis was recorded by a specific department (e.g. "internal medicine I"). This department is also represented as an Organization resource.<br>
That department in principle belongs to the condition's asserter. In theory it could be retrieved by finding the asserter's PractionerRole.organization.<br>
But since a practioner's role and organization can change over time - I would like to capture it along with that condition. Any suggestions?<br>
What I had looked for specifically - but didn't find was that Condition.asserter could also point to the responsible organization.<br>
Thanks!</p>
