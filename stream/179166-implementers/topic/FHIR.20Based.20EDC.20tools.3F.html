<p>Does anyone know of electronic data capture tools that have import or export options in FHIR?</p>

<p>I don't know of any that work primarily in FHIR; there are vendors adding FHIR support (either directly or through third-parties).  An example is Clinical Pipe (a product of Protocol First) that builds on SMART-on-FHIR (I believe).  In Research Systems the primary exchange model is the CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM) - but that is an just a transport model with a schema for the common containers (visits, forms, fields).  You could ask a question across in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="135" href="/#narrow/stream/135-research">#research</a>.  Medidata, Oracle, Protocol First, ClinicalInk and Nexttrials have all participated in Connectathons.  There was a presentation from the Amsterdam DevDay from Castor EDC.  </p>
<p>I think there's a lot of interest, as eSource has been made a priority by the FDA, and other approaches (RFD, etc) never really took hold.<br>
(STATEMENT OF INTERESTS: I work for Medidata)</p>
