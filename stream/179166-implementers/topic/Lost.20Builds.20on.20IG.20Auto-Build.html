<p>X-posting from issue I submitted on auto-ig-builder Github (in case anyone here has run into this and has some guidance).</p>
<p>I've setup the auto-build as described in the docs and even got some failed builds -- which proved to me that the auto-build webhook was working. I fixed the issue that caused the initial failures, but now I never get a build notification for my IG (whether triggering via a push or manually) -- and the build.log hasn't changed (it is still that last failed build).</p>
<p>I think my build is getting hung or timing out. Is there any way to get more insight into the build process as it is happening? As it is now, it's very difficult to determine what's going on -- as the build succeeds locally (albeit with reported errors in qa.html), but seems to get lost in the auto-build.</p>
<p>This is for the IG at <a href="https://github.com/HL7/us-breastcancer" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/HL7/us-breastcancer">https://github.com/HL7/us-breastcancer</a>.</p>

<p>FYI -- I've done some additional investigation and I think this is a memory issue.  More details on the GitHub issue if you're interested or think you can help: <a href="https://github.com/hl7-fhir/auto-ig-builder/issues/3#issuecomment-374452761" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/hl7-fhir/auto-ig-builder/issues/3#issuecomment-374452761">https://github.com/hl7-fhir/auto-ig-builder/issues/3#issuecomment-374452761</a></p>

<p>Thanks for the report exclamation let's move this conversation to <a class="stream" data-stream-id="9" href="/#narrow/stream/committers">#committers</a> -- but briefly, yes this seems possible. in the past I remember the builder generating errors when it ran out of memory, but your investigation is a big help.</p>
