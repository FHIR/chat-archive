<p>In Australia, the authority that approves medications (the Therapeutic Goods Administration or TGA) records the sponsor, but not the manufacturer, of medications. The sponsor is the organisation that sponsors the medication through the approval process, they might not actually manufacture it.<br>
Is sponsor within the scope of  <a href="http://build.fhir.org/medication-definitions.html#Medication.manufacturer" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/medication-definitions.html#Medication.manufacturer"><code>Medication.manufacturer</code></a> ? I expect not.<br>
Is this a widely used approach?</p>

<p>in Europe we have the Marketing Authorisation Holder. that is the entity that is responsible for the pre-market and post-market.</p>

<p>I expect that the medication.manufacturer would not be the same thing (unless the name would change to something less explicit).<br>
And this should be covered by the medication reqork to align with IDMP . <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192166">@Jean Duteau</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191651">@Rik Smithies</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191759">@Melva Peters</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192080">@John Hatem</span></p>

<p>the Marketing Auth Holder (MAH) is much more relevant than the manufacturer. I would suggest a change of "manufacturer" to something else, but I expect the IDMP work should make that change redundant</p>

<p>I think that the approval process for a medication is outside the scope of the medication resource</p>

<p>it should be indeed out of the clinical resource. the BRIDG folks are looking at IDMP which is the regulatory aspect.<br>
I expect that in the rework of the medication resource, things that are not clinical should revert to the regulatory side (BRIDG).</p>

<p>I guess Manufacturer wants to convey the concept of "what is the brand of this product" as in Acme aspirin vs Bayer aspirin. if so, i'd argue that in Europe the MAH is the responsible, and more relevant than the actual manufacturer.</p>
