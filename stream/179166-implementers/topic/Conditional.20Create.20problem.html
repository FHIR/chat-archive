<p>Maybe someone here has an answer - I am sending a transaction bundle with conditional creates on a Device Resource and an Observation Resource. The ifNoneExist parameter is based upon the identifier in both cases. However, the operation works with the Device, but not the Observation. So on the second upload of the same Bundle the response shows the Device with the expected 200, but the Observation is created with a 201. So now if I take that same identifier and use it to search, I get two identical Observation resources.</p>
<p>Any idea what I am doing wrong? I get this result on the HAPI FHIR version 4 server and the pyro version 4 server. I do not know if the pyro is based upon HAPI.</p>

<p>ANswer is that I had a '+' sign in the identifier. That needs to be escaped in the URL. If not, it gets converted to a 'space' when unescaped. There are two ways to escape a space, %20 and '+'. Didn't know that (seems kind of stupid to have two ways to do the same thing).</p>
