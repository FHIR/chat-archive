<p>Has anyone implemented the withdrawal of consent (and the impact/propagation)?</p>

<p>the impact on future would naturally happen with the Consent being deleted or updated with a deny... but propitiation (ala GDPR) would need to be done as a workflow, likely based on looking through history of export events, and sending them some indication of the Consent withdrawal.   Based on the purposeOfUse of that export, the target recipient might have regulated reasons to maintain.  I expect most reasonable is to inform the individual of all these data flows, as part of the transparency requirement.   This is the extent of the discussions that we have had in the Security WG.</p>

<p>The basics are that deny becomes allow or vice versa. We have no defined workflow for active propagation, but:</p>
<p>We've defined that in exchange scenarios you shall always check consent for that. These would be kept in a central national service. This is not live yet, but in my mind that makes active (pushed) propagation unnecessary for this type of consent.</p>
