<p>Hope this is the right place for this question</p>
<p>We have a software which generates observation reports (ECG).</p>
<p>In some situations these reports are done spontaneously without any ServiceRequest by a HIS. Because we did not receive any ServiceRequest - we do not have any ID from a requesting system.<br>
If we want to send this observation back to HIS/EMR an ID (HL7V2 "Placer Id") for the this observation/service is required, which should be generated by HIS/EMR.</p>
<p>Are there any tpyical Profiles/Scenario defined? Otherwise I would choos the following approach:<br>
We - as the "filler" - send a  POST Request to HIS/EMS to create the ServiceRequest, and<br>
secondly query this ServiceRequest for the appropriate Identifieres.</p>

<p>Having the lab create a ServiceRequest on the HIS seems more than a little odd - but there's nothing to say you <em>can't</em> do that if the HIS is happy to let you.  However, my leaning would be to just populate the v2 placer id with the same value as the v2 filler id and not bother having a ServiceRequest at all...</p>
