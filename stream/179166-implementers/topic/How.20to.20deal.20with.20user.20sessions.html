<p>I am looking at a workflow use case like this: A doctor is filling a document (Questionnaire, for example). And in the middle of this, he gets an emergency call and has to close the document and leave. When he comes back, he would like to resume his work instead of start from start. How do I save his partially completed QuestionnairResponse? I think using either browser's session state or periodically update QuestionnairResponse to server. Is there better solution commonly used in healthcare domain?</p>

<p>First, be careful about using the term 'document' :)  A QuestionnaireResponse is not a document in FHIR terms.  It's totally fine to store a QuestionnaireResponse with a status of in-progress.  There's no expectation that such an instance would necessarily meet the rules for a 'complete' Questionnaire.</p>

<p>Yeah. I should remember that "document" has special meaning in FHIR. ;)<br>
When I say "document", I really mean "forms" or "charts" in real world.</p>
