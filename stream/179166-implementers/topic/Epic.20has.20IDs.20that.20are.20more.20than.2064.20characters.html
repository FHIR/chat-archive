<p>I'm using HAPI libraries to communicate with an Epic FHIR servers and store the responding data from HAPI on a HAPI FHIR server. In a couple cases, it has responded with IDs that are 80+ characters long, which causes HAPI to throw an exception because FHIR has a requirement that IDs are no longer that 64 characters. Does anyone have any ideas on how to work around this? Does hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter have any configurations or options to work around this issue?</p>

<p>Just a thought --- what if you stored the Epic id as one of the identifier elements and then created your own (UUID?) id for the resource.   Of course then you'd have to fix up all FHIR references though so that might not be ideal.   Another, related thought it so have an algorithm that converts the long ids into 64 chars (or less) for the Id.  You'd still have the resource referencing  problem though.    (One advantage of putting the Epic Id in the identifier array is that you have traceability back to the original Epic id.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191505">@Sean McIlvenna</span> of course this is broken server behavior and should be fixed by the server.</p>
<p>That said: even in <em>general</em> with <em>correctly behaving servers</em> it can be hard to re-use an external server's IDs, because if you talk with &gt;1 server, you might see an ID like <code>Patient/123</code> being used differently across them.</p>
<p>One pattern you can use is to explicitly remap <code>(server, resourceType, resourceId)</code> tuples into your own IDs, and keep track of the mappings you create. A sub-pattern is to accomplish this mapping by feeding the tuple into a hash function, like</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code> $ echo -n &quot;https://server.example.org/Patient/123&quot; | openssl dgst -sha256
 6cebb4ef2ce81ed08cbc094ee54e5513ebc2463a02bf2d73024004e6b7572704
</code></pre></div>
<p>(This works, of course, even if the source IDs are too long.)</p>

<p>So, I think all roads lead to "change the id and update references to it"...<br>
Does anyone know if there is any functionality in the HAPI libraries to aid in doing this? Or, do I need to create some custom logic to go through Java objects and find any instances of "Reference" class, and check if the reference needs to be updated with a new ID...</p>

If there were tickets, they were not accepted, or it might have just been chat.fhir discussion that ended up in a "no - not going to change the length in the FHIR spec" answer.</p>

<p>I don't think it makes sense to keep an Epic to UUID mapping table. Epic is publishing these IDs as FHIR IDs, so they need to be compliant with the spec. They are welcome to create an identifier or extension if they want to share their 80+ character internal ID in addition to a legal FHIR ID.</p>

<p>Both things are true: IDs should be spec compliant <em>and</em> systems consuming resources from &gt;1 external source will need to remap (or use some full URI representation, not just bare IDs), else conflicts arise.</p>

<p>And to pre-empt any comments about that being normative content, at some point, FHIR is going to have to sort out how to change normative content.  It wouldn't apply retroactively to R4 of course, but there is an increasingly large list of normative content that needs updating.</p>

<p>At some point, we're going to have to figure out how to make updates to normative content when the spec isn't meeting the needs of the industry.  ID length maybe isn't on the top of the list, but there are other areas both in infrastructure and PA where I know we'll need to look at normative updates.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> , I understand your point about breaking changes... But, I don't think loosening the rule is the same as tightening the rule when it comes to breaking changes. To implementers that are following the rule, it doesn't break anything for them.</p>

<p>I'm going to have to agree that changing the max length is <em>definitely</em> a breaking change.  If a database currently has a field with a 64-character limit (since that's what it is defined to be), this change will be incompatible.  Same thing for any system doing validation outside of the official FHIR validator (e.g., checking field lengths, regex expressions, etc.).</p>
<p>Note that I'm not arguing for or against right now, just noting that changing it will potentially break <em>any</em> existing system.</p>

<p>Breaking change is any change that could cause systems to fail when consuming conformant data.  We've defined the types of changes that systems are expected to be able to handle between versions (e.g. new elements, new codes, new resources, new reference types).  Relaxing invariants wasn't one of those.  I'm not saying it's impossible, just that it will be very hard - so we'd need to be convinced that workarounds weren't possible or that the pain of workarounds to the community would be higher than the pain of making the change.</p>

<p>Sometimes the best way to make a change like this is through grass-roots civil disobedience. If you can invent a label for the new variant and get a bunch of vendors to use your test suite, you can reduce the FUD for early adopters. They will still have to go through their tool chain with a fine-toothed comb to see if some field in a database or a fixed memory allocation in a misc script somewhere will break their data flow, but that's stuff that would have to happen anyways if v5 were to suddenly announce longer IDs.</p>

<p>A hexadecimal representation of a guid, takes 32 characters to assign a unique value to every grain of sand on earth and have values left over. If you use something like base64 it takes even less. How many unique values does one EHR need for a given resource? How you cross 64 characters is by doing things like compositing all the attribute values into making a PK, "Epic-Condition-Site-Client-Provider-ConditionCode-Patient-number" rather than assigning a guid as a primary key and be done with it.</p>

<p>The issue (which I've seen non-Epic systems run in to as well), is that sometimes it is <em>very</em> useful to have reversible IDs rather than mapped IDs.  That means you need to encode enough data in the ID such that when decoded, it has enough info for you to resolve it to the data you are addressing.</p>

<p>If you have a reversible id, one that is calculated and can be decoded. Take my example above. I used the condition code in my id value let's just assume that the condition was 12345678. Turns out I made a typo and the actual condition code was supposed to be 12345679. Now that code attribute has been fixed to 12345679 but the decode of the id still has 12345678 in it. What is the correct code value?  Since the id value of a given resource can never change, then in the case of generated id's, the components that comprise the id shall never change. Otherwise you end up with conflicts. My opinion: the id attribute should only ever have 1 definition, "the PK of the resource".</p>

<p>I'm fine if the industry settles on a 64-character limit.  But I don't accept the "it is normative now and forever" argument.  That comes up more and more in FHIR, and if FHIR can't evolve, then it will become obsolete.

<p>"Good" is relative in engineering, as all engineering disciplines are about evaluating tradeoffs.  One the one hand you have strict spec compliance, and on the other hand you have lower system cost, faster time to market for the API (so patients  can get their data sooner), and in some cases, significantly simpler system design (for example, the facade server in front of other FHIR servers), which leads to lower system maintenance.</p>

<p>Following ...<br>
The notion of trying to 'encode info' in an id seems like a bad idea. [This might be the 'root cause' of Epic's long FHIR IDs -- remember, behind the facade is a MUMP string-based 'database' system.]   I remember reading articles about NOT doing that for coding systems, and I think the same applies for FHIR IDs.</p>
<p>The DB world frequently deals with 'schema changes', which this is in essence.   The process is not cheap but it's typically a migration process that includes not only the schema migration but also the data migration, tooling, client code.   Definitely not easy but can be done if there is value in doing it. </p>
<p>(not saying that is the case here but for system integrators that do not have the ability to change what Epic (or other system) gives them they need to work around this to get the job done, even if the spec says "not supported".)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191764">@Cooper Thompson</span>  - if Epic has this "problem" of needing long IDs, and as you're suggesting, other systems do too, then maybe there's something to be learned from this.   It seems like the internals of whatever system is providing a FHIR Facade (I assume that's what Epic and like-minded systems are doing) have this problem then there seems like there must be a way to provide an intermediary mechanism to implement a mechanism that creates FHIR IDs that fit the 64 char limit and are not dependent on composite keys, or at least not with the IDs they expose to FHIR clients.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="298707">@John Silva</span>  if you add an intermediary, then you are trading overall system complexity for the 64-character length, since you are now adding a mapping table to the integration.  In some cases (like Epic), we <em>could</em> implement that intermediary mapping internally.  However other systems I know of would need an external mapping layer, which means you need a database for the mapping table, DBA to maintain that database, network engineers to maintain the two new network connects (public-&gt;mapping tier and mapping tier -&gt; backend server), and a web server with enough code to execute the mapping and proxy the request, and then another admin to maintain and patch that web server.  </p>
<p>Many of those features could be incorporated into a product (API Gateway) of course, similar to the <a href="http://bit.ly">bit.ly</a> pseudo-suggestion.  But products aren't free, so that cost always lands somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191764">@Cooper Thompson</span> - yes, there would need to be an intermediary, which brings extra complexity and cost.   However, when an integrator needs to get the job done and does NOT have the ability to change the backend system (e.g. Epic or other that isn't following the 64-char limit) what other alternatives does one have?   I think the better question, which I think was already raised, is WHY would a system choose to be non-conformant to start with?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="298707">@John Silva</span>  The vast majority of our IDs are shorter than 64-characters -  only a few IDs in a few resource types get too long.  We may look at revisiting our ID strategy at some point, but now we have to deal with backwards compatibility, so the  tradeoff is "breaking backwards compatibility" vs. "be strictly compliant with the spec".   For us, making sure FHIR integrations continue to work in real world healthcare settings is more important than strict spec compliance.  </p>
<p>For other systems I know of, their choice is driven by a desire to keep system complexity low.  Healthcare IT is expensive, and keeping system complexity low keeps costs low.  So for them, the trade off is just cost vs. "strict spec compliance".  Even though I'm a standards nerd, I respect that engineering choice.  Being too much of a purist can be very impractical (and expensive).</p>

<p>Any FHIR client, especially those used by integrators, depend on the spec.  If a system doesn't comply then they have to 'special case' around that; assuming they have the ability to do that.   Having 'outlier systems' that do not conform makes the work of integrators more complex and problematic.   [Does Epic's FHIR API docs specify these 'resource with long/non-standard length IDs', I haven't seen this on the <a href="https://fhir.epic.com/Specifications">API pages</a>.].</p>

<p>Conformant and interoperable are different things.  Ideally conformance aids in interoperability, but it certainly doesn't guarantee it.  That said, conformance is what tends to be evaluated by regulation and certification.  Any system that sends ids over the limit is at risk in those processes - and also carries the risk of not interoperating with systems that depend on the length limit being respected.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197072">@Paul Church</span>  - Epic does consider this a bug, but we have a lot of FHIR dev on our plate (ONC stuff, but also a bunch of other countries have their own FHIR regs now), so we just can't prioritize a fix right now.  I've tried to make it clear that part of why I'm pushing back here is because I'm aware of other (non-Epic) systems that have the same problem and they don't have an easy solution.   This is not just an Epic issue.</p>

<p>If it's ok that the length can be exceeded, then I suppose it's ok for the id to have a % character in it, if it's ok for a % char, then I suppose it's ok to not do X, if that's ok then it's probably ok to do Y...... Eventually you get interfaces that don't interface.</p>

<p>"aware of other (non-Epic) systems that have the same problem" ...</p>
<p>Are these also facades around EHR 'backends' (w/o naming them)?   It seems like a facade should be able to deal with this because it's already the intermediary between the backend and the "FHIR server face" it's providing.    As folks more knowledgable than me pointed out, a 64-char id can represent a huge number but if Ids are generated by concatenating strings in the 'backend' then it's susceptible to this problem.</p>
<p>Oh well, it is what it is ...</p>
