<p>Hi, my team is currently discussing the appropriate use of the Organization.type field. Is it ok to store a hospital department specialisation (e.g. "neurology") there or is it only for wider types like "hospital department"?<br>
We do not want to identify the departments using the type, but make it possible to ask something like "all patients that have been to some neurology department in the past year".</p>

<p>I would go with Location and/or HealthcareService to capture the specialisation of a department. Organization would be the whole hospital, the wards locations of this organization.</p>

<p>A "hospital department" is not always expressible by location, at least not in the US. FHIR Location is a physical place, and a "neurology department," for example, may span multiple locations.</p>

<p>Organization can be used to describe parts of an organization. Organization is not just for top-level organization.  As Vassil outlines some physical locations host many sub components of many organizations.   This is why there is the Organization.partOf element, so that these parts of the a larger organization can declare their relationship to a higher organization.</p>

<p>I tend to agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192685">@Vassil Peytchev</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> , since hospital departments are often also organizational units with eg. their own director.</p>

<p>I can tell you that as part of the PlanNet/PDex work, the payor community is planning on using <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/organizationaffiliation.html" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/organizationaffiliation.html">OrganizationAffiliation</a> to represent this sort of information. I understand that on face, it seems that resource might only be for linking two organization entities, but I believe they are using it to capture information about things like Neurology department. In particular this is because <code>OrganizationAffiliation.specialty</code> for things like a speciality, and <code>OrganizationAffiliation.code.</code> You would then use that to connect to referenced <code>Organization</code> playing varying roles.</p>
