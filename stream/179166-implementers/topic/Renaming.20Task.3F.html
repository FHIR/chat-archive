<p>Could some of the challenges around Task be reduced with another name like "Activity" (or something else)?<br>
In BPMN, a task is one atomic element of work. Activity is more generic, and it can include sub-processes etc.<br>
It won't be more explanatory, but perhaps more in line with the fact that "task" sounds a human action, while Task resource can contain info about a single action, or a sub-process, or the entire workflow.<br>

<p>We need to differentiate it from procedures, drug administrations, encounters, etc.  All of those are generally considered sub-types of Activity, but not so much sub-types of Task.  That's why we went with the name we did</p>

<p>From a practical perspective, dotnet developers would love a rename from Task, since Task is a very commonly used base class in the .NET world, and so everyone working with the Task class (from HL7) has to prefix one of the two occurences to disambiguate..... not a huge problem, but still a pain in the butt.</p>
