<p>In the Orders and Observation workgroup we have been discussing several related tracker proposals to expand the Observation.subject type to Reference(any).   It is currently limited to Patient, Location, Device,Group.   This would represents a significant change in the Obervation's scope.   For example, it would allow an Observation about another Observation, Condition, MedicationAdministration - i.e. an interpretation or evaluation or assessment.    The Obvious benefit would be to allow greater flexibility to represent Observations  to just about anything.   The obvious pitfall with this change would be potential for overlapping scope with many other resources.  We are seeking feedback from implementers on:</p>
<ul>
<li>General support or opposition for this proposal</li>
<li>Whether this change would align with their system's structure. I.e., Is there separation between observations on patients and observations about other things like other observations or are these treated separately since, from a clinical perspective, they can be considered a observation vs an interpretation/evaluation/assessment?</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples include making an Observation about a variant (which is an Observation) to indicate if the variant is considered to be benign or pathogenic; Capturing observations (e.g. statistics) about Practitioners, Organizations, etc.  If the decision is to not use Observation for this, how would systems capture this sort of information?</p>

<p>I am working with oncology guidelines and I have run into a few observations would require this sort of reference if I want to be able to interpret the Observation without following a reference graph or pre-coordinating a concept. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>'Response to treatment of a target or non-target lesion' and other tumor-focused observations. To specify the lesion I have used  'bodyStructure-instance' or 'body-site instance' extensions. There are also many 'observation' like data elements in these guidelines that say 'Progressive disease' or 'stable disease', which are more like a subjective clinical assessment/impression than a strict question-answer observation. However if I could focus the observation on the Condition, than Observation fits these cases.</li>
<li>TNM-Staging. These are point in time assessments of disease stage, so I have used 'event-reasonReference' to reference the cancer condition. They come from a number of other Observations(tumor size, lymph nodes involved, etc). So they are sort of like an assessment however clinical impression doesn't quite fit the individual components of T, N and M.</li>
</ul>
<p>Allowing a different Observation focus would fit these oncology use cases well. But I see some crossover with the official extensions to BodyStructure as well as the specimen field, which would be the focus for observations on tumors that have already been excised. If it is the subject field that is altered, would that mean that the patient with the disease being observed could only be determined by following the reference Observation -&gt; Condition -&gt; Patient?</p>
<p>The main oncology specific use case that was discussed a bit at the connectathon was TNM staging. An Assessment type resource, maybe ClinicalImpression with changes, could potentially address this.  This change would make it a lot easier to put these types of data elements into FHIR, though I'm not certain the qualify as Observations. </p>
<p>I'm in support of the change unless guidance can be provided for these 'Observations'</p>
<p>Heres a quick example of what goes into TNM staging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lung imaging shows 4 cm lung tumor in the left lung apex. Tumor has extended to the vertebral body.  These observations lead to a T category</li>
<li>Bronchoscopic biopsy of the left mediastinal lymph nodes was positive for malignancy. This observation leads to an N category</li>
<li>No clinical evidence of disease outside the thorax on imaging or exam. -&gt; M category.</li>
<li>The medical oncologist in charge asserts that this is a T4N2M0 disease by the AJCC 7th edition staging system. This corresponds to Stage IIIB.  I feel like an Observation with code: T-category and value T4 can't really be understood without knowing the cancer that it is talking about.</li>
</ul>

<p>This change would make it easier to put these Observations that are about the patient's condition in FHIR, and so I support it.</p>
<p>However, maybe a Condition isn't observed, but assessed, and there is a better resource for this type of data element.</p>

<p>I made originated this suggestion and also had a ballot comment about this. After some case studies, I believe the proposed solution of changing Observation.subject to ref(Any) might not be the best approach. I believe two attributes are needed. I believe in most cases, Subject should be the Patient. This is who the observation is associated with. We shouldn't lose this information or make it harder to find. Instead, I suggest adding a new optional attribute representing the "focus" of the observation. As discussed above, this can be something more specific than the entire patient, such as a condition of the patient, the patient's environment, diet, or behavior, or intervention. Currently, we have a special case where BodySite can act as the focus of an observation in the sense described here. Another special case is when the subject is a device, where the Subject is replaced by the device, and then then patient associated with the observation can only be determined by referring to the patient in the device resource. It would be more consistent if the Subject were typically the patient, and then the focus could identify specifically what the observation was about, which could be reference(Any) -- a body site, device, condition, allergy, location, environment, intervention, encounter, behavior, etc. The option that the Subject could be an implanted Device would also be removed replaced by the "focus" attribute.</p>

<p>I personally think it should be core - it has a variety of use cases. The challenge  is probably that it doesn't really exist in v2 or CDA, so it's not really common</p>

<p>So in this chat. I'v seen a lot interest in adding an accelerator but no mention of how to put the brakes on.   Whether on subject or focal subject Reference(any) would still create a hammer for every nail.   If we went this way, I think we need to rewrite the scope and boundaries of Observation to reflect the fact that Observations can be made about anything.  And I think no matter what guidance we provide like "if an element exists in a Resource X use that instead" that folks will use a series of Observations instead.   Nothing in this chat has persuaded me otherwise</p>

<p>I'd include the following language:<br>
At its core, Observation allows expressing a name-value pair or structured collection of name-value pairs.  As such, it can support conveying any type of information desired.  However, that is not its intent.  Observation is intended for capturing measurements and subjective point-in-time assessments.  It is not intended to be used to capture information that is designed to be captured by other resources (e.g. allergies, procedures, care plans, etc.).  There will however be situations of overlap.  For example, a response to a question of "have you ever taken illicit drugs" could in principle be represented using MedicationStatement, but most systems would treat such an assertion as an Observation.  Adhering to such convention is an appropriate use of Observation.  If implementers are uncertain whether a proposed use of Observation is appropriate, they're encouraged to consult with implementers on [[chat.fhir.org implementer's stream]]</p>

<p>I don't think that I support this change to Observation.subject. I fail to understand why this is necessary. If the change was done, then we would have a mess with overlap with  basedOn, context , performer, partOf, derivedFrom, etc. This overlap would hinder interoperability.  We need to make the FHIR model with holistic perspective. To focus too tightly on esoteric use-cases can cause us to accept inappropriate holistic perspective modeling.</p>

<p>With Privacy/Security hat on my head -- Major concern that I have that I can express is that by moving subject to &lt;any&gt; we can have observations about the patient that are not directly understood as about that patient. Thus they are not found by a search on observations about the patient. This has additional ramifications related to Consent and other Access Control rules on the Observation. As it will be hard to know the access control rules (including Consents) that would need to be considered when someone requests to access that Observation.  This also is problematic relative to AuditEvent, and the various access reports that are necessary from a Privacy and business-rules post processing.</p>

<p>Thanks Grahame but Those are existing  focal-subject targets and I am not concerned  care about them .... My Angst and concersn are when start talking about  focal-subject = Observation, Condition, Medication where it starts to become more an evaluation than an observatino and then the overlap with other resource elements becomes a problem.</p>

<p>Agreed with bullets 1-3 there.  <br>
 - With an OO hat, we need to put more boundaries around Observation and have it focus on being things relevant to the patient (or other clinically relevant subject).  Allowing Observation to be used for anything, basically unbounded (even in scope within a Patient, because you can say practically anything like "Patient Sex" is still an observation) is unhelpful and leaves OO holding a mess of a resource which will be nigh impossible to thoroughly documented &amp; maintain.  <br>
 - With an Implementer hat, there are a wide number of things which get stored internally in relatively generic data structures for convenience or historical reasons, but still should be presented in FHIR (or application UIs, CDAs, analytic universes, etc.) as a more strongly typed attribute.  So even in day-to-day life I wouldn't find it helpful to have Observations everywhere in place of other use-case-specific attributes.</p>
<p>Bullet 4:  Observation seems like overkill for simply a key/value pair attribute, though it can obviously be used for that.  So per the need to restrain it in a more focused direction, <br>
 - Personal recommendation: I suggest a new "thing" which is used more generally for these and that it be owned by FHIR-I.  I don't have really strong feelings if it's handled as a new resource (GeneralAttribute), a complex data type, some new flavor of backbone, or whatever.  But since we all agree on the need to have many arbitrary attributes (# of beds in a hospital, who the hospital's accrediting organization(s) should be, etc. as well as other previous examples), it needs to be very simple, rather small, and owned with the broadest perspective across the whole spec.</p>

<p>Isn't an Observation about an Observation still about the subject? So the subject would still be the same ~patient~ but I do understand that it would be good to have an element to related the Observation about an Observation.  Is this a new element that you are referring to as focal-subject? If so, then I missed that clarification, and I would be fine with that as the base subject still is clear.</p>

<p>Observation A (patient has variant X) is subject of Observation B (variation is pathogenic).  It can't be component because it's done at a different time.  And it's not derived from because it's not a stand-alone statement about the patient - it's qualifying the variant directly.</p>

<p>I thought we already supported observations about observations using derivedFrom? That would cover "from X we determined Y", or is there some other kind of observation on observation? Peer review (an observation that another observation is unfounded, incorrect, etc.)?</p>
<p>What I'm worried about is an Observation on an Organization or ValueSet, or otherwise devoid of a patient context. I've never been at ease with the "an Observation is a way to hold any measurement/conclusion" school of thought. I think it needs to relate to a patient (or group of patients). If you want to hold departmental performance stats, look elsewhere.  In part, this is what my earlier comment, and I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> 's about context, basedOn, etc. was about -- the context can't be limited to an episode of care or encounter if if the scope is meant to include "departmental wait times over the past 3 months"?</p>
<p>Changes to better support observations about groups of patients, fetuses, etc. make sense. But we should avoid allowing Observation to become a hold-all bag for key-value pairs related to anything.</p>

<p>Derived from lets you say "because your blood work said X, I've decided that Y is true about you".  In both cases, the "subject" is the Patient.  However if I want to say "this variant is pathologic", the subject is the variant.  It wouldn't be correct to say "Patient has variant X, therefore Patient is pathologic".  The thing being described - the subject - is the variant, not the patient.  (Though the "record target" would be the Patient for both)</p>

<p>If some genetic variant is deemed pathologic long after the initial sequencing, that sort of seems like the A in SOAP, O being the initial observation and whatever else caused it to be seen as pathological. Why did they deem it pathologic? It could also be a Condition with evidence reference to the initial observation, if it is now confirmed to be causing disease.</p>

<p>A much later interpretation (pathological vs. unknown significance) is definitely possible, especially in the CG space yes.  But I think that's NOT the original observation, and especially in that space we really need a way to add secondary analysis as a specific workflow.  That's not common to most other situations, CG is one of just a few where there's a much later secondary post analysis and I'm confident that any pathologist signing off on that report would expect there to be a NET NEW report as a whole, not just one observation referencing another.</p>

<p>I agree it's NOT the original observation - but it's <em>about</em> the original observation.  The whole point is that they don't want to run the sequencing again.  They want to re-analyze all of the variants previously identified and assess whether there's anything new to assert based on "current" knowledge.</p>

<p>The question is how do we properly capture the assertion about a variant - which is itself an Observation made previously.</p>

<p>OK I am going to present a couple of options to the OO WG either tomorrow or next Thursday which leaves everyone unhappy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Option 1:  keep focal-subject as an extension with Reference(Any) and add a bunch text saying basicaly not use this if there is a perfectly good resource that does the job. ( maybe provide an example or two) and the caveat that in the future will look at possibility of a new resource to handle these types observation that are really truly assessments  ( OpenEHR Evaluation archetype or a slimmed down ClnicalAssessment or overloaded MeasureReport)  </li>
<li>Option 2:  promote focal-subject inline with Reference(Any) <em>as a DSTU element</em> and add a bunch text saying basically not use this if there is a perfectly good resource that does the job. ( maybe provide an example or two) and the caveat that in the future will look at possibility of a new resource to handle these types of assessments  ( OpenEHR Evaluation archetype or a slimmed down ClnicalAssessment)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196572">@Travis Stenerson</span>  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191407">@Rick Geimer</span> and everyone who contributed to this very long thread. Several suggestions: <br>
1)  We might want to avoid the word "subject" in the name of this attribute. Observation.focus might suffice, while minimizing the confusion with Observation.subject. <br>
2)  Wordsmithing: <br>
Definition: The focus is the point of attention when the observation concerns a specific aspect of the subject, or something associated with the subject. The focus of an observation could be an existing condition, an intervention, the subject’s diet, behavior, environment, a body structure such as a implanted device, or a body structure such as a tumor. The focus could also be a spouse, parent, fetus, or donor. An example use case would be using the Observation resource to capture whether the mother is trained to change her child's trachestomy tube. In this example, the child is the patient of record and the mother is the focal subject.</p>
