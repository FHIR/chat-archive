<p>For a personal research project I would like to store some environmental factors as pollen count, temperature outside, humidity outside as observations for a given location, in addition I would like to register symptoms from the patient. </p>
<p>Any suggestions on suitable ways of thinking this in FHIR structures?</p>

<p>have you looked at the gravity social determinents of health guide? this is structurally a very similar idea even if it's not the same data</p>

<p>Thanks for the link! Sorry, a bit noob in this field. <br>
But this project seems to collect patient reported environmental factors thorugh questionnaires. For my project I would like this approach for the part with patient reporting the symptoms. </p>
<p>However I was thinking that for the environmental factors associated with an physical location, it might be better to store this data as observations directly from the sensors in a way?</p>

<p>sorry, I wasn't paying enough attention. The symptoms from the patient -that bit is similar. The environmental factors - sound like observations on a location</p>

<p>Thanks for your support, so a questionnaire for patient reported data, and observations associated with location for environmental data!</p>

<p>sure. you could look at the SDC implementation guide which has quite a bit to say about the relationship between questionnaires and observations</p>
