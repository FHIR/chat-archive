<p>There isn't a single right answer to your questions.  Most appropriate storage depends on what you want to do with the lake.  If you're interested in using FHIR as a persistence model, you can check out the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179289" href="/#narrow/stream/179289-storage-for-FHIR">#storage for FHIR</a> stream and read the discussion there.</p>
