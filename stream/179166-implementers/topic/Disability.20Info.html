<p>Hello! It would be great if you advise me the right way of documenting information about the disability of the patient.</p>
<p>We are going to collect the following dataset for the patient related disability:<br>
- date of disability asserted<br>
- date of disability examination<br>
- date of re-examination<br>
- reason of disability<br>
- disability group (severity)<br>
- flag - disability removed</p>
<p>As an addition, we should be able to relate this information with documents which evidenced disability (we have standardized document forms/templates for it).</p>
<p>What kind of resource (or resources) should we use for it? Our opinion that a condition resource is a good solution. What do you think about it?</p>

<p>Condition is probably most appropriate, though you could also look at EpisodeOfCare</p>

<p>I agree that a Condition resource would be appropriate, then use an EpisodeOfCare resource to track other related clinical resources back to the condition.</p>
