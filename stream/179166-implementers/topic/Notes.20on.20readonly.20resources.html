<p>Do we have a pattern for adding / expressing notes added to an existing readonly resources?<br>
Eg: Consider a situation where resources are shared across organizations but not everyone can update the resource. But they could add some notes on the data. Currently our systems (non-FHIR) use a separate resource to capture the notes and link it with source data.</p>
<p>Almost every resource in FHIR does have a note(s) property (of type Annotation) which handles the situation if readonly restriction was not in place. What could be a possible way to achieve it?<br>
One of the first thoughts was to create a duplicate of the resource, add the extra note and link with original resource (maybe using linkage resource). But this needs the clients to understand that duplicates exist and find the best resource based on some logic.<br>
Any other thoughts or comments on current thought?</p>

<p>sounds kind of a like a VerificationResult?</p>
