<p>Is anyone sending SNOMED CT post co-ordinated expressions in FHIR resources? If so what do you do with the "slots" that would have had data when not using post co-ordination. For example in a Procedure resource, if the Procedure.code was post co-ordinated as a "Change of dressing (procedure)" post co-ordinated with "left cheek" - what would go into Procedure.bodySite?<br>
I'd be interested in hearing from any members who do use post co-ordinated SNOMED expressions within FHIR, and whether there are advantages or disadvantages of this approach over using the FHIR information model.</p>

<p>This is not only relevant for post-coordinated SNOMED CT expressions.  The pre-coordinated ones have Finding Sites etc. as well.  This and other things are being discussed in the SNOMED on FHIR meetings: <a href="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/FHIR/SNOMED+on+FHIR" target="_blank" title="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/FHIR/SNOMED+on+FHIR">https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/FHIR/SNOMED+on+FHIR</a></p>

<p>Yes, I was also going to refer to the SNOMED on FHIR discussions - but Daniel beat me to it.  We are working on providing guidance for exactly these sorts of questions.</p>

<p>where we know about this in pre-coordinated systems, we discuss this on the elements - particularly on observation</p>

<p>more generally, at the spec level, our advice is that if you populate both, they shall not disagree</p>

<p>we have left making further rules to implementation guides. However.... my advice is duplication is better than not duplicating; systems that understand the code will have to choose which to use, but others that don't are not left in the dark</p>

<p>I'd be also interested to know how to deal with codes that are not post-coordinated. For example, where to put the laterality of the body site. Also, where to place the type of procedure/surgery (e.g. whether primary, revision). Would really appreciate help on these two.  Thanks.</p>

<p>You can use the approach and target body structure extensions to point to BodyStructure when you want a more fine-grained description of what the procedure is doing.  (You can use a contained resource or a distinct resource depending on whether you want to track the site over time.)</p>

<p>Primary vs. revision would need to be an extension I think.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191403">@Michelle (Moseman) Miller</span> ?</p>
