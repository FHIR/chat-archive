<p>Which resources to use to trigger an intervention - should I use Procedure (as an intervention) or should it be a communication  from teh remote monitoring team to trigger an intervention from the local team in the hospital,</p>

<p>Communication is generally used to record that information has been disclosed.  E.g. "Patient was given smoking cessation material" or "Copy of the report was sent to Dr. Aman".  If you're wanting to ask for an intervention to happen, that would typically be a Request resource - ServiceRequest, MedicationRequest, DeviceRequest, etc.  Some interventions (e.g. fill out a form, cancel an order) might use the Task resource.  Procedure is used to represent a procedure that's either "in progress" right now or happened in the past.</p>
