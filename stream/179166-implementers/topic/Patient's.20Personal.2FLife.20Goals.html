<p>Is the Goal resource a correct choice for Patient's Personal/Life Goals?<br>
<strong>Examples:</strong>              <br>
1 -  Granddaughters graduation |  May 12th 2017  |  Western Kentucky University<br>
              (Comments: Patient expressed transportation needs. May be able to ride with a cousin- please follow up)<br>
2 -  Live to be 90 years old  |  October 14th 2020 |  Patients Home<br>
               (Comments: Patient expressed that he would love a birthday party in his own home with close friends and family)<br>
<strong>Suggested Mapping:</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field Name</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>FHIR Mapping</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Goal</td>
<td>Text</td>
<td>Goal.description</td>

<tr>
<td>Date</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Location here is the location of their personal goal. It may be at home or it may be in a different state or country even. The point in capturing the location of the goal is to be able to help the patient plan for achieving this goal (find transportation/buy plane tickets/bus tickets/coordinate with family or friends/ find housing, ect). </p>

<p>Why would you use a nested QuestionnaireResponse instead of a boolean extension for "Does the patient need Narus Health's assistance"?</p>

<p>Thank you, Lloyd, for the notice. Certainly I'll use an extension here. BTW, are there any conventions on naming extensions?<br>
Also I would like to indicate the <code>Goal.category</code> (set it by default for all Patient's Personal/Life goals, it won't be selected on the form). Does the concept <code>Personal milestones (observable entity) SCTID: 160786009</code> seem a proper value for such goals? (There are also concepts <code>Life event observable</code> (observable entity) SCTID: 364706004 and <code>Family milestone</code> (observable entity) SCTID: 160852007).</p>
<p><strong>So, the mapping will be the following:</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field Name</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>FHIR Mapping</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Goal</td>
<td>Text</td>
<td>Goal.description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Date</td>
<td>Date</td>
<td>Goal.targetDate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Location</td>
<td>Text</td>
<td>Goal.Extension:goal-location.valueReference = Location</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Comments</td>
<td>Text</td>
<td>Goal.note</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Does the patient need Narus Health's assistance for this goal?</td>
<td>Yes/No</td>
<td>Goal.Extension:goal-isAssistanceNeeded.valueBolean</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191329">@Aleksandra Pavlyshina</span> - There's no particular naming standard for extensions.  Good practice is for the URL to resolve to a human-readable (and ideally a computable) definition of the extension (based on the HTTP Accept header).  And good practice is also for the name to be descriptive.  The extension URL obviously needs to be unique.  For HL7-defined extensions, we typically start resource-specific extensions with the resource name so they all group together.  Beyond that, name as you see fit.  In terms of SCT codes, I'm not sure.  They all sound to me like codes for something that has happened rather than something that's desired to  happen.  However, I'll let those more familiar with the deep workings of SNOMED provide their opinions</p>
