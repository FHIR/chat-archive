<p>More specifically, the question arises from what to do when one FHIR server implements multiple IG's, but these IG's have overlapping resources. Take the Da Vinci PDex IG and the CARIN BB IG for instance--both have a patient resource. How does a server handle being able to serve multiple patient resources?</p>
<p>My current solution is to use a base Patient FHIR resource as the source of truth for the patient resource. This means for instance that the fhirUser claim URL as specificed by the SMART spec will be a link to this base R4 patient resource. The base patient resource will then have links to a PDex patient and a CARIN BB patient via the link field.</p>
<p>At the last connectathon this was brought up as a major issue, where no one was aware of a standard or best practice for handling this expected use case. Some other options I heard were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply combine the profiles to make one super profile that is compliant with all the profiles (rejected because although there are no conflicts in the example I listed, there is nothing stopping different IG's from creating a profile on the same resource that would cause a conflict)</li>
<li>Don't have a base R4 resource (rejected because there is no obvious way as to what the entry point of the application should then be i.e. the fhirUser claim in the SMART token)</li>
</ul>
<p>There were possibly others, but there is a lot of confusion around a topic that I feel should be explicitly called out in the FHIR specification somewhere considering the spec was designed with this in mind of a server being able to implement multiple IGs and the community at large being unsure as to how to handle this.</p>

<p>In general, you serve up resources, not profiled instances.  You simply work to ensure that the resources you serve up meet the requirements of all of the profiles you need to.  (And monitor the creation of profiles to ensure they don't impose constraints that would prevent compliance with other profiles.)</p>

<p>there's nothing stopping it, but we do have processes in place to make it less likely - it's not an outcome we're in favor of at all. And it's a valid criticism to make of the IGs that they don't allow combining like that. And in our experience, it's rare.</p>

<p>HL7 working groups should be voting down any IG that is so restrictive that it couldn't be compatible with other IGs. It shouldn't even be necessary for the group to understand all possible combinations - just avoid patterns that are likely to cause conflict.</p>

<p>Nothing stops IGs from creating conflicts other than good design.  It's possible that not all of your data will be valid against all profiles.  For example, a profile on Patient might say that deceased[x] is prohibited - because deceased patients aren't allowed for that use.  That doesn't mean that your system can't have patients where that element is true, only that they can't be used for the use-case the profile is designed for.</p>

<p>More problematic is profiles that do things like say "<a href="http://Patient.name">Patient.name</a> is 1..1" - i.e. patients aren't allowed to have multiple names.  That's generally not a true statement, and the profile should instead say "There must be one slice of <a href="http://Patient.name">Patient.name</a> that meets these narrow filter characteristics" (e.g. has a particular extension).  That allows the system that wants only one name to find the one it needs without prohibiting all the others from being present.</p>

<p>If one stores the union of all profiles one needs to be able to communicate, you'll have to morph them into the appropriate profiled-resource before sending the resource. Given that in general it's not a good idea to store profile metadata in your persistence layer, this kind of approach may be a  best practice anyway. You will encounter incompatible profile requirements - certainly if one were to be involved in any projects/product development that is to be used across jurisdictions/countries.</p>

<p>I don't know that it's a given that profile requirements across differing jurisdictions/countries means it's a given that they must be non-compatible.  If well designed, they <em>shouldn't</em> be non-compatible.  It should ideally possible for a system to spit out prescriptions or vital signs that are just as valid in the US as Russia as Nigeria.  The only possible issue might be language, and even there there are standard conventions for supporting multiple languages if your software has the capability of figuring out the translations.</p>

<p>Terminologies shouldn't prevent interoperability - simply send the codes required by all jurisdictions.  (Well-designed profiles shouldn't ever mandate that only 'their' code is present.)  Certainly it's true that not all profiles will be well-designed, but there's nothing that makes jurisdiction boundaries present that <em>prevents</em> following good design principles.</p>

<p>There's a general expectation of putting a filter on your outbound content to strip off anything "this receiver isn't <em>allowed</em> to have".  Terminology licensing considerations would need to be a part of this just as patient consent and other business rules would.  (I wasn't aware of any SNOMED restriction that prohibits licensed senders from transmitting codes to non-licensed receivers, though there may be limitations on what licensed receivers can do.  Obviously whether a sender counts as licensed or not may depend on where their system is installed.)</p>

<p>It is my belief that there should only ever be 1 instance of any resource and it should have 100% of the data that corresponds to it. <br>
In the example of IGa says SHALL NOT have protocolApplied and IGb says SHALL have protocolApplied then the IG authors should come together to resolve.<br>
OR perhaps you use the _profile filter again Immunization?_profile=IGa means "SELECT * FROM Immunization where protocolApplied is null" <br>
You have all the data, you can comply with IGa by returning just those that do not have protocolApplied.<br>
Maybe in some alternate reality you strip protocolApplied from the resource on the way out the door JIT, but I don't imagine that is legally, clinically sound. As in what if you strip off a piece of information that changes treatment for the worse, I think you'd be liable for the harm.</p>
<p>If a user does Immunization?all and then they complain "You gave me resources that don't comply with IGa" you get to say, you didn't ask for only resources that apply to IGa you asked for all.<br>
Or perhaps they say, "This resource doesn't comply with IGa." As long as you don't declare that it does, then what's the harm. What makes it comply with IGa (not having protocolApplied) thusly any resource that does have protocolApplied isn't part of that IG.</p>

<p>The point is, you still store all the data. If a user requests data that matches IGa then only return the resources that match IGa. If the user requests data that matches IGb only return resources that match. You can have them all, just filter based on the requested profile. IGa doesn't tell you that your database can only have conformant resources, it says only resources that meet certain conditions are conformant with this profile. All other resources are allowed to exist.</p>

<p>I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="335936">@Daniel Venton</span> in terms of best practice.  However, sometimes reality intervenes.  Some receivers have a legitimate legal requirement to never receive data they don't recognize.  (Some receivers may think they have that need, but in fact don't...)  Also, some interfaces only want a subset of data - e.g. only active living patients.  That doesn't mean that others can't exist, just that certain operations or whatever need to be filtered.</p>

<p>You cannot 'POST both version' because systems in general do not store FHIR - they have some database that contains an immunization record, and then they render it as FHIR - and they cannot really render it both ways out of the same end point</p>

<p>That is OK because those are separate things (if I understand correctly) - the server holds both and renders them according to the two profiles</p>

<p>there's a language problem here- a single server can host conflicting profiles, but only if the data and the usage is compartmented logically - somehow - so that the conflicting data is a requirement. An underlying issue here is the difference between system-ish profiles and data-ish profiles. The spec describes them as entirely different, and they are in principle, but they tend to leak into each other in practice</p>

<p>Agree re language - "supports" may be thought to imply disallowing other instances. If you "support" X then can you allow a Y that doesn't conform to X? The words "hosts" or "serves" seem more open.</p>

<p>If true, that all resources served by a server comply with a profile. You can still have 1 database with all data. But instead of doing the filter via the _profile parameter you implement the filter by the domain name:<br>
<a href="http://IGa.myfhirserver.com/Resource">IGa.myfhirserver.com/Resource</a> = returns (SELECT * FROM MyDb WHERE IGa compliant)<br>

<p>so it all depends on the nature of the profiles. Obviously with observations, there'll be multiple applicable profiles that observations conform to and anything more sophisticated than a $10 device will have different kinds of observations. Where as system level profiles - it's hard to have more than one.</p>
<p>The example of observations is pertinent - you do a search for observations for a patient, obviously you're going to get lots of different kinds of observations, and those observations will conform to lots of different profiles (mostly, not explicitly). But you search for all observations with a particular code... they're probably all going to conform to a single profile, but even then, there could be some observations that conform to some profiles, and some that conform to others</p>
<p>Kinds of profiles on Observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>jurisdictional polices about coding</li>
<li>system policies about provenance/authorship etc</li>
<li>domain policies about observation codes and components and units and reference ranges</li>
<li>institutional policies about annotations and workflow rules</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is that IGs don't provide a computable way to understand all this.</p>
