<p>We have a situation where patients are contacting their general practitioners through digital channels. We want to implement a triage solution to sort these inquiries.<br>
We plan to do this through the use of Questionnaires and then extract the necessary information from the QuestionnaireResponses into other relevant resources. Currently we are looking at extracting to a ServiceRequest.</p>
<p>There is a functional request for two versions of priority attached to the ServiceRequest: one where the patient themselves are to say what they assess their priority to be, and the other is what the triage-tool asses the priority to be (this to cover situations where the patient themselves do not correctly assess their own priority).</p>
<p>Given that ServiceRequest.Priority has a cardinality of 0..1 and can therefore only be used for one of the two priority assessments, what would be the best way to attach information to the ServiceRequest of a second priority?<br>
Would Observation or Condition be reasonable to use, or something else?</p>

<p>I'd probably use an extension for the patient-asserted priority.</p>

<p>You could submit a change request to propose that as a 'standard' extension.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, Lloyd. I'll have a look at doing that.</p>
