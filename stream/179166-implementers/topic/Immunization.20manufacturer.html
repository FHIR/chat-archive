<p>Looking at the immunization manufacturer  element I was wondering if this element represents only the actual manufacturer ("the organisation that holds the authorisation for the manufacturing process") or if it is a more comprehensive element covering any organization having any kind of 'ownership' with the product  (as manufacturer , as marketing authorization holder (MAH), as dealer...).</p>
<p>I'm asking that because looking at some immunization data sets  currently under development there are some referring the MAH, others the manufacturer and assuming they are using these terms appropriately (i.e. by using the IDMP definitions) I was wondering if both map in the manufacturer element or not....</p>

<p>We haven't had discussions that in depth. I know in the v2 world, there have been similar issues, mostly around relabelers (companies that purchase vaccine and then package them with the things necessary to administer the dose such as gloves and swabs). As well, it gets complicated when one company is acquired by another but maintains some level of autonomy. This may be complicated because only one manufacturer is allowed. The Public Health WG has an Immunization session planned for WGM Friday Q2 if you're available and want to come discuss further.</p>

<p>This is another example why Immunization should use a reference to a Medication.</p>

<p>Copied from Immunization status thread: Sorry because I'm new to this thread and you may have considered this option. The MedicationKnowledge <a href="http://build.fhir.org/medicationknowledge.html">http://build.fhir.org/medicationknowledge.html</a> resource may be a way to handle the immunization product details/metadata.</p>
