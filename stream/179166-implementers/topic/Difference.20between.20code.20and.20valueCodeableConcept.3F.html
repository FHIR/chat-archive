<p>Could someone explain what is the difference between &lt;code&gt;&lt;coding&gt; ... and &lt;valueCodeableConcept&gt; ?. Both look exactly same from the structure wise inside observation resource. Sorry I looked at the documentation and could not quite understand when to use which. </p>
<p>thanks a lot for your help</p>

<p>Observation.code is defining what kind of Observation occurred.  Observation.valueCodeableConcept is describing what was observed.  So you might have a code that says "skin color" and a valueCodeableConcept that says "grayish-blue".  You can also have Observation.code present with something like "systolic blood pressure" and instead of valueCodeableConcept, you'd have valueQuantity.  Think of Observation as a name-value pair.  The code is the name and the value is the value.  Sometimes the value happens to be a code.</p>
