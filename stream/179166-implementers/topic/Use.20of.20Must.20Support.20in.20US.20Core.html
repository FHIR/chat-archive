<p>I'm developing an IG for USA, and the expectation by business leaders is that it should be comply with US Core. However, the must support (MS) markings in US Core are more extensive than those required by the use case. We are also trying to use the Genomics IG, where _virtually everything_ is plastered with MS markings, and 90% of it is irrelevant to my use case (for example, see <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/StructureDefinition/diagnosticreport" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/StructureDefinition/diagnosticreport">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/StructureDefinition/diagnosticreport</a>). Do you think it right for an IG to specify MS in the absence of a specific use case? It seems to me that the MS should only be specified with respect to a specific, concrete use case. Comments?</p>

<p>My limited experience in another industry was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, this is a valid issue</li>
<li>But it gets wildly uncontrollable if people start deciding "I don't need this so-called 'must' thing" because others downstream will, sure as you're born, someday assume that everyone has of course done all the musts</li>
<li>Ergo, it's infinitely better to formally create a well thought out subset, which you can declare. </li>
</ul>
<p>But that was another industry so maybe not appropriate here.</p>
<p>(Is it possible for an implementer to declare "I ignore the following musts"?  I can imagine the shrieks on conference calls if that were proposed out loud... among other things, "So what should I assume are your values for those things?")</p>

<p>The challenge we face is that US Core and Genomics IG <em>do</em> have specific use-cases.  (Meaningful use EHR capabilities and lab reporting of genomic data, respectively).   However, other IGs that might wish to leverage the same content may have use-cases that don't require the same degree of support.  We don't want to split the existing IGs into two (which adds complexity for both readers and maintainers.  And we don't want to loosen the requirements - the elements are indeed intended to be 'mustSupport' in the context the IGs were created for.</p>
<p>In Montreal, we discussed the notion of being able to depend on IGs, but have a flag in the dependency that says that they do <em>not</em> inherit mustSupport elements of other IGs.  However, we didn't have consensus on this and more discussion is necessary.</p>

<p>For any IG to be testable, the test tools must reflect what the conditions/constraints of the implementation guides are.  It cannot constrain more, or less, as then it effectively is creating a new implementation guide.  Applying that consideration to US Core, at the top it should be as open, least constraint that fit any possible use case for the US, so specific use cases can then constrain further.  For example, as not all HIT needs to support Implantable, or more generally UDI Devices, the Device profile at the top should not have a MUST SUPPORT on those elements that are only relevant for fully UDI device support (mostly implantables in the US at this time, but expected to expand rapidly).  So unfortunately, either some have to be loosened so they can be constrained by subsequent IGs, or alternative profiles are created that specific use cases/IGs can clearly specify which one(s) are to be conformed to.  Without such stratification, we are only pushing the issue down to the test tools, which then have to declare which use cases they support, thus are creating an IG.  And further, specificity will have to go down to the data type component level as everything optional will yield otherwise different, incompatible choices where it actually matters.  Note that this is of particular importance where the test tools are used in certification testing where MUST SUPPORTs will be tested and may force systems to build support for components that are not relevant to them.</p>

<p>If we can stratify profiles and put in views based on use case which profile(s) apply, that would be very helpful.  And not be worried about that the number of profiles will increase.  That's o.k.</p>

<p>IGs are created for a particular use-case.  mustSupport is part of that.  If you want your instances to comply with that IG, but not to impose the same support requirements, you're going to want a distinct IG, but deriving from the base IG (less mustSupport expectations) is the correct solution.  It will create a great deal of confusion if IGs created for one purpose have to include documentation about a bunch of other (and non-relevant to the authors) use-cases.</p>

<p>We did discuss this option in Montreal - as there is a clear usecase where people want to reuse the data definition part of a profile within their IG for their usecase, but not necessarily the conformance part that came with the profile (and that came from conformance demands in the original IG the profile is used in).  Interesting to see that US Core is an immediate example of this.  It seems clear to me that we need to separate the conformance part from StructureDefinition.  However, as Lloyd stated, there was no consensus in Montreal on how to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>No, it's not that easy. It's not "depends on".  It's about moving mustSupport information out of StructureDefinition - that was one of the options we discussed at least.</p>

<p>actually, there's a 3rd option - leave it where it is, and allow it be used, but also create a special kind of profile that does not change the structure, just sets must-support expectations, and links to an ExampleScenario</p>

<p>My analogy is going to the grocery store to get ingredients for tacos. The ingredients are already sitting on the shelf and you pick and choose the ones you need for your recipe (your use case).  Many taco ingredients, like beans and ground beef, have uses beyond tacos. By analogy, I think it makes sense to separate structural definitions of profiles (the ingredients) from MS markings (the recipe).  Otherwise you will end up needing a huge grocery store that carries "ground beef for tacos", "ground beef for meatloaf" and "ground beef for hamburgers".  An IG should be able to pick and choose from existing structures, and apply the MS markings that make sense for its particular use case. In other words, I am supporting separation of MS markings from structural profiles.</p>

<p>In that case, your issues wouldn't be limited to mustSupport, but also to what's mandatory - and that's <em>not</em> something we've discussed softening.  If it's mandatory in the base profile, it has to be mandatory in all derived profiles.  If you don't want the mandatory, you can't have a derivation relationship between the profiles.</p>

<p>Besides doubling everyones time and effort, splitting the profiles defeats the purpose of using a common set of base profiles which is to normalize a set of elements that are likely to  be present.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> Despite the label I put on this topic, this is NOT a US Core problem. It is reusing any IG. There are MS labels all over the Genomics IG that we don't need... although DO we want to use the Genomics structures. And, I don't think doing things this way doubles the work. It is the same amount of work, but a different delivery mechanism that puts the MS into a different bucket than the structures.</p>

<p>I think it's reasonable to want to use the Genomics structures without the Genomics MS declarations.  I <em>don't</em> think the Genomics IG should separate its constraint structures and other documentation from MS support declarations (in either the authoring or publication process).</p>

<p>I'm coming to this discussion late, but I think there's a strong need for use-case-specific "must support" requirements, even though the data profiles (vocabularies, extensions, etc) are shared. Grahame's Australian base (<a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/" target="_blank" title="https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/">https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/</a>) provides an example without (I think) must-support -- but creating a whole separate IG for each use case is beyond what most authors are going to consider tolerable.</p>

<p>You don't want to maintain (or publish) the mustSupports separate from the profile itself.  When someone who needs to adhere to must supports looks at a profile, they want to see everything together - element, cardinality, data type, definition and mustSupport - it's all relevant for implementation.  And when you're authoring a profile for a specific use-case, you want to maintain the information together too.  Separating it is too likely to result in errors.</p>

<p>mustSupport <em>never</em> impacts validation - mustSupport always deals with behavior outside the instance.</p>
<p>You would need to list the elements you want to mark as mustSupport, but you wouldn't need to list any of the constraints</p>
<p>min=0 with mustSupport=false/stripped means it's ignorable.  min=0 with mustSupport=true means you're expected to support it in whatever manner the profile/IG defines.  If you're stripping mustSupport on derivation, you're saying the opinion of the parent IG that "we think you should really really use it" isn't relevant in the derived IG - presumably because your scope of use is quite different.</p>
<p>Not clear on your last bullet.  If you're deriving, you can only derive from one profile (and you derive based on the snapshot of that profile - so everything it was based on too).  You'll either get the MS flags or you won't.  It will mean more work for those who don't want to inherit the MS flags in that they'll have to go through and flag everything they want.  But it's still less work than defining a completely independent profile including all the constraints and then trying to keep the constraints in sync with the 'base' profile that doesn't have any formal computable relationship.</p>
