<p>Hello: We are having some general queries related to the SSO and Sandbox Environments:</p>
<p>1&gt; How does the SSO (sso-openid-connect) capability/OpenID Scope is defined and works is actual reality? How it's conformance is demonstrated during the certification? Detailed explanation to the process will be really helpful.</p>
<p>2&gt; We analyzed that having the sandbox environment under the Public Documentation Condition is not mandatory and it is good to have environment for 3rd Developers to test before production but we just wanted to confirm about our understanding. Please Suggest that are we correct on our understanding?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>There are multiple implementation guides for various settings. The most dominant one is for end-user applications, SMART-on-FHIR, which has discussions at <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179170" href="/#narrow/stream/179170-smart">#smart</a> . This solution is built into many tools like HAPI.</p>

<p>for the most part using openId-Connect is natural OAuth. Healthcare does not need anything special here. (Well, there are policies but everyone has policies)</p>
