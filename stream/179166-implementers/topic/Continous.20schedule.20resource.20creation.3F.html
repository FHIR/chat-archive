<p>The documentation of the slot resource states that:<br>
"If a service had a weekly schedule created that permitted eight 1 hour appointments each day of a working week (Monday - Friday), this would be constructed by a single Schedule resource with the dates for the start and end of the week set, and then 40 (5x8) Slot resources associated with it."</p>
<p>In my understanding i would have to create a single schedule instance with 40 slot resources each week. </p>
<p>And if my service is permitting 30 minute appointments each day of the week, from 8:00am to 10pm, this would result in 98 (7*14) slots per service each week. <br>
For example i am having about ~1000 healthcare services with schedules, so per year i'd create 5.096.000 (1000<em>52</em>98) slot resources if im counting correctly.</p>
<p>So its recommended to have an automated workflow each week, creating these resources? What is the recommended pattern?</p>

<p>This is up to your internal system how this is done.<br>
Our system supports a templated definition, so we don't need to generate them at all, they are virtual instances.<br>
But nothing to say you can't do what you've suggested.</p>
