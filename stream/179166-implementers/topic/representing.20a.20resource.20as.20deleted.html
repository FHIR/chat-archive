<p>hello — and requisite apologies if this question has already been asked/answered, but i did a few searches and came up empty.</p>
<p>i want to be able to return resources as having been deleted on a query like <code>/fhir/Patient/?_lastUpdated=gt2019-02-13T16:00:00Z</code>.</p>
<p>is there a recommended/specific way to express this in FHIR? the closest thing i can think of is to use an <code>isDeleted</code> modifier extension, but i'm wary of doing that for all the reasons modifiers are tricky.</p>
<p>thanks in advance!</p>

<p>The only way to return deleted resources is with the isDeleted modifier.  The whole point of deleting a resource is ensuring it doesn't come back in a query response.  Modifiers aren't necessarily tricky, they're just less widely supported.</p>

<p>Given no other parameters, probably better to use _history which has the deletions in it too.</p>

<p>However, that's going to return every version from every change that's happened since you last looked.</p>
