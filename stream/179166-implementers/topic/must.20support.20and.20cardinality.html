<p>I have always found it a little difficult understanding the semantics of 'must support' versus cardinality. Is it possible to have 'must support' on an element with a minimum cardinality of 0?</p>

<p>Absolutely.  E.g. Patient.deceasedDate</p>

<p>If I recall correctly, "must support" means "you need to understand what to do with this element if it is there." Cardinality just says whether it needs to be there.</p>

<p>Cardinality is 0 - we allow you to send patient's who aren't deceased and don't require you to make them so before sending data.  However, if they <em>are</em> deceased, we expect you to be able to capture/send/understand/display/include in decision support logic/report based on/whatever that data element.</p>

<p>(The specific meaning of mustSupport is dictated by the IG or profile that uses it as "support" means different things in different contexts.)</p>

<p>I see. I guess its trying to understand what it means when one requires "you need to understand what to do with this element if it is there". I assume it doesn't matter to the server but only to the consumer of the resource.</p>

<p>Well, it matters for servers too - for example not throwing it away.  (Servers aren't required to support all element they receive - they may throw away certain extensions and might also throw away core elements in some cases.)</p>

<p>But it's not something you can test by looking at an instance, you can only check "mustSupport" by looking at the behavior of the system.</p>
