<p>If one creates two appointments that are related/part of one overarching set of appointments, i.e. X-ray at 09:00 followed by a consult at 09:30, how would one currently indicate that these are linked, or that the fulfillment of one is a prerequisite of the other ? If the first is cancelled, the second one needs to be cancelled as well. If the first one is moved in time, the second one needs to be moved as well. <br>
How would one cover this use case - is this already covered, or by means of some extension reference ?</p>

<p>There is currently no defined way for this to be done. And no-one has proposed an extension for this to date either.<br>
(it is understood this is a requirement to be addressed, and likely to be dealt with post STU3 along with the requirements for the scheduling service that is starting to kick off between PA, SOA and OMG(HSSP)</p>
