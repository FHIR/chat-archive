<p>What is the clinical status for an allergy that was refuted?<br>
Example: </p>
<ol>
<li>Patient tells GP they are allergit to penicillin (clinicalStatus=active?, verificationStatus=presumed)</li>
<li>Patient undergoes tests and it is not an allergy, just a minor known side effect (clinicalStatus=????, verificationStatus=refuted)</li>
</ol>
<p>The clinicalStatus is not clear to me from the value set<br>

<p>Active. Presumed is the usual case.  Laboratory or skin tests exist for less that 2% of possible drug allergies.  And direct challenge, the other possible verification, is done only rarely because of the expense and risk.  It is in the overwhelming majority that an allergy/intolerance is based on history or observation.  The other scenario that I would consider "verification" is, it happened 3 times (or more) with the same drug (substance) and the same reaction.</p>

<p>@Russ - the real question is, if the an allergy is refuted, what is the clinical status? Are you saying "active" is the clinical status for a refuted allergy? There is no "presumed" status in either clinical or verification status</p>

<p>I have a similar question that I'm going to put here, even though my original question was with conditions, but, allergies also has a similar refuted status.</p>
<p>How would most suggest storing a patients "refutation" of having an allergy (or condition, or similar medical concepts), ie, in a discussion with a doctor/nurse, or maybe more commonly in filling out a checklist form.</p>
<p>It seems like it might make sense to have verificationStatus "refuted" and the asserter be the patient themselves (or possibly a RelatedPerson for a caregiver).</p>
<p>But, the wording on FHIR for these definitions seems to be too narrow to use it some of these scenarios currently:</p>
<ul>
<li>The issue above with a refuted allergy or condition having any sort of clinical status... to me the "The subject is no longer experiencing the symptoms" suggests they have in the past, which isn't necessarily accurate if the condition is refuted, which could mean they've never had it</li>
<li>This issue... the  wording of refuted with "has been ruled out by diagnostic and clinical evidence.", doesn't really jive with a patient just telling you "I don't have this"... there is no diagnostic or clinical evidence there.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am guessing the answer might be that "patient provided information" such as this is something that gets stored in a completely different way (questionnaire?), but, we at least generally do store them in the same "table/bucket" per se within our system, so, it still seemed relevant possibly to send it this way via FHIR.</p>

<p>Initially:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patient tells GP they are allergic to penicillin </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point in time (allergy hasn't been refuted yet), I agree with the earlier guidance that clinicalStatus should be active based on the definition of active being:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The subject is currently experiencing the condition or situation, there is evidence of the condition or situation, or considered to be a significant risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, after some period of time, the allergy is subsequently refuted per</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patient undergoes tests and it is not an allergy, just a minor known side effect </p>
</blockquote>
<p>My earlier response applies to this point in time (when the allergy has been refuted)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In R4... you can leave clinicalStatus empty, if needed, as long as validator isn't enforcing best practices</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the allergy has been refuted, clinicalStatus = active would no longer be appropriate since (based on definition of active above) the patient isn't experiencing the condition, nor is there any evidence of the condition, nor is it considered to be a risk after it has been refuted.</p>

<p>Jean, maybe I am parsing words here too much, but "The subject is NO LONGER at risk of a reaction to the identified substance.", the "no longer" to me suggests they were at one point.... if you are marking refuted, that would suggest it was as stated initially marked " unconfirmed" (Jose said "Presumed", I don't see that as a named option, I assume we mean, "unconfirmed"), but, then decided that they didn't have the allergy/intolerance, most likely ever, which moves it to "refuted".</p>
<p>Resolved is really no better with the wording of " is considered no longer to be present. "  That suggests at one point it was present.   </p>
<p>None of the 3 clinicalStatus descriptions to me seem to be saying "The subject has NEVER had a reaction to this substance", which to me suggests leaving ClinicalStatus blank for "refuted".   I am agreeing with Gay Dolin's that someone starting an A/I as "Unconfirmed", and then moving it to "Refuted", the refuted (at this point, without modification to the descriptions) verificationStatus should have an empty clinicalStatus.</p>

<p>If you have an unconfirmed/active allergy - you are stating that you believe the patient is at risk for a reaction but you don't have confirmation.  Then you do something that causes you to no longer believe the patient is at risk - you refute the allergy and you make it either inactive or resolved based on whether you tested/re-exposed/whatever.</p>

<p>i read your case at the top and it didn't say the patient was never allergic.  it said that the patient told the GP that they were allergic.  That would get recorded as a Unconfirmed/Active allergy.  Then when the GP looked into it and thought the patient was full of baloney, he changes the statuses to "refuted/inactive" or perhaps he does some simple testing and then changes it to "refuted/resolved"</p>

<p>Thanks Michelle, as I stated, that is what I thought with the checklist Q&amp;A, (using questionnaire or something else), thanks for pointing out that wording.</p>
<p>It sounds like we have some consensus for some sort of modification to either some of the language surrounding the inactive setting (adding ", or never had," after "at risk of" in the description?) or adding the guidance officially that for refuted VerificationStatus, that the clinicalStatus should be blank.   I think whatever is decided here should also get applied to conditions, and possibly other elements as well, but, I'd have to review those more closely.</p>

<p>I just read the rewording on that request change:  <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-26464">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-26464</a></p>
<p>The change to "not presently" instead of "no longer" IMO allows for the nuance of "never had" into the definition (although the "returning" at the end still makes that suggestion, it is less heavy handed than the "no longer" being at the beginning").  </p>
<p>It does appear though that they didn't approve the wording change though, am I reading that correctly?</p>
