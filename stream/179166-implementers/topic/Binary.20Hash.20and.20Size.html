<p>I’m working on a solution that involves the need to be able to update/version/replace existing <strong>Binary </strong> resources.  Initially, it seems like a PUT against <strong>Binary </strong> would be the obvious choice. However, we also have a desire to perform a quick integrity check via <strong>hash </strong> and <strong>size</strong>.  Unfortunately, <strong>hash </strong> and <strong>size </strong> are defined within the <strong>Attachment </strong> element.  </p>
<p>Rather than build a solutions where clients attempt to request a PATCH or PUT to the related <strong>DocumentReference</strong>, <strong>Communication</strong>, <strong>Patient</strong>, etc. resource, it seemed ideal to just be able to request to version the <strong>Binary </strong> object directly whenever applicable. </p>
<p>Since Binary does not extend <strong>DomainResource</strong>, it can’t have extensions added to it.  However, I suppose it would be possible to extend <strong>Binary.meta</strong> so that a custom representation of <strong>hash </strong> and <strong>size </strong> are included there. </p>
<p>Similarly, it'd be nice to be able to include <strong>hash </strong> and <strong>size </strong> in the response headers when streaming a binary as a result of a GET request from a client. This would allow for clients to validate the object without also having to request the related <strong>resource</strong>/<strong>attachment </strong> as well. </p>
<p>Has anybody else had a similar issue in dealing with attachments and the absence of <strong>hash </strong> and <strong>size </strong> metadata on the <strong>Binary </strong> resource?  Has the question of adding <strong>hash </strong> and <strong>size </strong> to <strong>Binary </strong> been raised as a change proposal to be specification before?</p>

<p>It's not something that's been asked previously.  Binary is unique in that it's commonly shared as a raw binary instance rather than a FHIR XML or JSON resource with base64-encoded data.  As a result, we're pretty cautious about adding "extra" stuff to Binary.  (Most of what's there now is expressible using standard headers.)  An alternative possibility would be to define an Operation that returns the hash of the Binary.  Then you could do <code>GET [base]/Binary/[id]$hash</code> to return the hash for the current version of the binary.  This might actually be a use-case where invoking an operation on a historical version of a resource could also be useful.  E.g. <code>GET [base]/Binary/[id]/_history/[version]$hash</code></p>

<p>Hi Lloyd.  We also share the concern about dealing with a GET of the raw binary as we intend to steam just the raw bytes rather than doing an XML or JSON resource with the base64-encoded data.  </p>
<p>That being said, it appears that <strong>content-length</strong> could be mapped for size but I don't have any obvious answers for hash when reviewing the standard HTTP headers. (There is a deprecated <strong>content-md5</strong> which is close but not quite right.)  FHIR could always choose to add a non-standard and optional header to the relevant request and responses so we can continue to avoid adding anything that must be included in the body of a request.</p>
<p>We do have two use cases here:<br>
1. Server wishes to validate bytes received during a direct create/update to binary so it would expect hash + size in a POST/PUT request. <br>
2. Client wishes to validate the bytes returned during the retrieval so it would need hash + size in an response to a GET. </p>
<p>Of course, your recommendation works but would add another round trip to the process. This is fine as long as we can assume we're in a low-latency environment.</p>

<p>The reason for hash and size to be in Attachment is because when the Binary (or other bit bucket) holds the actual bits, one MAY want to confirm that what they retrieved from the Binary is what the Attachment was intending them to retrieve. It is not a security mechanism, it is an continuity-integrity mechanism (hence why it is simple SHA1).  To move these into the Binary would break this purpose. If you want to be sure you got the bits that the binary URL is referring to, then use HTTPS; as https includes authenticity and integrity mechanisms (aka TLS). If TLS is happy, then you got what is there.   If you are happy just knowing you got the bits from that location, then don't bother with hash and size in Attachment. They are optional to populate, and they are optional to use.</p>

<p>(similar, but weaker, argument can be made for the use of hash and size when the content is base64 encoded in attachment.data; except this is just confirming that you have successfully been able to un-base64.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> : We were looking to perform an integrity check.  However, there seemed to be some confusion on the specification's intention behind hash/size.  After reading this thread, it seems as if we are always simply trusting lower layer protocols to correctly transfer the object between client/server.  I was simply incorrectly thinking that hash/size existed to ensure that the bytes received were actually the bytes expected.  Put differently, I was under the impression that hash/size were used as something akin to an application-layer checksum. </p>
<p>Part of the reason I was under the impression that FHIR used hash as a checksum is that IHE-XDS uses hash explicitly for this reason.  </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>4.2.3.2.10 DocumentEntry.hash
Description: The hash of the contents of the document.

The hash attribute can be used to identify accidental document corruption, mistaken duplicate
IDs, etc. The SHA1 algorithm and hash attribute should not be used for identifying malicious alterations.
</pre></div>


<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span>  Moving hash/size into Binary does not defeat any ability to perform an integrity check against the data. The binary's content is the thing that we are testing the integrity of when we include it in the Attachment. Binary already has metadata (i.e. contentType), why is additional metadata about the data being considered as a breaking change?  I'm afraid I am not following your rationale here.</p>

<p>The hash on attachment is used to verify the binary pointed to by the URL hasn't changed since the Attachment instance was created.  That's about checking integrity of content that can evolve independently.  We don't have anything to check that a transfer completed successfully - that's presumed to be managed at the HTTP layer.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> thanks for the clarification.  That is what I suspected.   As an aside, shouldn't versioning be used to verify that the binary hasn't changed over time?  Also, who's to say that the server didn't change the binary but fail to update the hash on the Attachment?</p>

<p>@Aaron can you elaborate on what risk you are trying to prevent? There are other solutions in the FHIR spec, and in the infrastructure upon which we build FHIR. You could use a Bundle.signature. You could use a Provenance.signature. You could add an extension.... There are many choices. Each of these have a specific reason, and each has some drawback. It is best to align your need with he best tool.   The hash/size in Attachment is inspired by the use-case that drove it into XDS, or viewed a different way it is in Attachment because it has been found useful in XDS when the Attachment and the body of the url are manintained in different services.</p>

<p>Versioning can work if you're pointing to a Binary instance that supports versioning.  But that support isn't required for FHIR systems and there's no expectation that Attachment will always point to FHIR-hosted data.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, we've solved our issue.  We wanted a way to perform an application-layer check that the content received is exactly what we expected.  This is a redundant check on top of what TCP and layer 2 (ex: ethernet) protocols provide but it is one that was wanted none-the-less. </p>
<p>Essentially, I was confused by the use cases for hash and size.  I think it would be excellent to add the clarity that was provided in this thread to the specification itself.</p>

<p>Excellent point. Thank you for bringing it up. </p>
<p>I think our customer wants to ensure that the client applications can perform a hash then export the data that they just hashed without failure.  For now, we've just added a server-side option in our product to say "if you receive a hash in an attachment, check that it matches the hash that we computed for the bytes received and reject when there is a mismatch".  If somebody wants to spend the time performing that check then they are welcome to do so.   </p>
<p>Of course, if we are relying on this check to actually check a problem then we have a significant issue somewhere in the process of sending content to our repository.</p>

<p>Correct.  We wanted to avoid the overhead of having to include the Attachment in a request to update an existing Binary.  Again, this comes back to the requested usage of hash/size as a checksum.  If we could drop that requirement, we'd just update the Binary directly without needing to include an attachment in the request.</p>
