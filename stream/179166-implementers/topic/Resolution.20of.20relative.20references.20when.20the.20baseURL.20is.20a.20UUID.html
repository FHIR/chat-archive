<p>The spec currently says <code>else no resolution is possible and the reference has no defined meaning within this specification</code>.  However, the tooling <em>does</em> perform resolution.  Specifically, if you have a resource in a Bundle with fullUrl of urn:uuid:someguid1 and have a reference to Patient/someguid2, the tooling resolves that to the resource entry with fullURL of urn:uuid:someguid2. </p>
<p>In other words, resolution obviously <em>is</em> possible, so I'm not clear why the spec is stating that it's not possible and has no meaning.  Is there a reason why the specification doesn't reflect what the validator and publishing tooling currently do?</p>
