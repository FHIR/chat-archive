<p>I need some help trying to distinguish between several AdverseEvent elements.  Please let me know if I am correctly interpreting the elements: AdverseEvent.event indicates a type of event using the adverse-event-type value set that includes SNOMED CT clinical findings (and in R5 seems to change to AdverseEvent.code referencing the same value set updated to include SNOMED-CT serious reportable events). So this "type" is different than "category" and seems to indicate what happened (e.g., a fall, a medication reaction, etc. And that is distinct from what impact the event had on the patient which is the AdverseEvent.resultingCondition (referencing the Condition resource in R4 and R5). But what is distinct about AdverseEvent.outcome - in R4 it uses a required adverse-event-outcome value set of 6 concepts (resolved, recovering, ongoing, resolvedwithSequelae, fatal, unknown) and in R5 uses an example SNOMED CT incident outcome categories.  So I assume that means that AdverseEvent.event (or .code in R5) should indicate the thing that happened (fall, medication reaction); the AdverseEvent.resultingCondition indicate what happened to the patient because of the event (e.g., bone fracture, hives) and the AdverseEvent.outcome is a categorization of the impact of the resultingCondition. I want to be sure I am correctly using these elements.  Also, the AdverseEvent.suspectedEntity is the causative agent with R5 adding AdverseEvent.contributingFactor for factors that are different from the suspectedEntity but that help worsen the likelihood of a resultingCondition or poor outcome.</p>

<p>That sounds right to me...</p>
