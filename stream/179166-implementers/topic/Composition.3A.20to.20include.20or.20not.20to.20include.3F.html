<blockquote>
<p>The complete set of content to make up a document includes the Composition resource together with various resources pointed to or indirectly connected to the Composition, all gathered together into a Bundle for transport and persistence. Resources associated with the following list of Composition references SHALL be included in the Bundle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Composition.subject</li>
<li>Composition.encounter</li>
<li>Composition.author<br>
....</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So if I query for [base]/Composition: does that mean that these inclusions are required or only when you call <code>Composition/[id]/$document</code> or <code>Bundle?type=document</code> or a (v)read on a document Bundle? It would be helpful if Composition follows the same rules for inclusion as any other resource, hence I'm hoping that what was meant was "SHALL be included in the <strong>document</strong> Bundle:".</p>

<p>I'd be extremely surprised if it were to be otherwise. A Composition resource is not a document, so search works just like it would for any other resource type.</p>

<p>Does that mean I should add a ticket for updating the wording?</p>
