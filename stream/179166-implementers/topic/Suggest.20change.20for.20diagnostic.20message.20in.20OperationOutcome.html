<p>Hello, I was uploading a patient bundle to a public SMART server, <a href="https://r4.smarthealthit.org">https://r4.smarthealthit.org</a>, and encountered a "400 Bad Request" HTTP response on an entry in the bundle. I learned that this was because the entry had an id &gt; 64 characters with some further troubleshooting. However, I believe the diagnostic message in the OperationOutcome I got from checking the response doesn't immediately indicate that: </p>
<p>"Can not process entity with ID[mCODETrialMatchingCancerRelatedRadiationProcedure02PatientExample02], this is not a valid FHIR ID"</p>
<p>I'd like to suggest that perhaps the diagnostic message could be changed to be more descriptive as to why a FHIR ID is not valid, or that an additional diagnostic message can be added to indicate that (since OperationOutcome.issue.diagnostics is an array), similar to this diagnostic message:</p>
<p>"Can not create resource with ID[123], no resource with this ID exists and clients may only assign IDs which contain at least one non-numeric character".</p>
<p>I apologize in advance if there is some terminology I could better use to describe the issue- I am still new to FHIR.</p>
<p>edit: I've received some insight about this potentially being an issue with how the server handles invalid IDs, so this topic may not apply to the FHIR spec.</p>

<p>Good practice is to provide an OperationOutcome with a detailed description of why something failed.  However, depending on the layer of software at which the issue is detected, that's not always possible.  So FHIR can't make a stronger statement than we already have.  You're free to nudge particular implementers to be clearer - and sometimes they'll both be able to and care to change :)</p>
