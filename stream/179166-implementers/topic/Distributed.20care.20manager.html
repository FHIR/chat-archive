<p>question from an implemeter: Have you come across any implementations that are using a FHIR architecture to implement coordinated care / care plans?  By this I mean something that:<br>
·         Defines the condition being treated and the goals of the care plan.<br>
·         Includes tasks that are intended to meet those goals.<br>
·         Includes scheduling of those tasks and assignment of participants to those tasks.<br>
·         Allows observations to be recorded that can be used to test whether the goals in the care plan are being achieved.</p>

<p>Hello <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>, we, at Health Samurai, are working on FHIR mapping for such a system - Narus Health Solution. This is a custom care management application designed specifically around palliative care, capturing the patient's "care" related needs in addition to their "clinical" needs.</p>

<p>Narus common model is 'Issue-Goal-Action-Outcome'. Now we are applying FHIR architecture to this model. <br>
The decision was made to keep the issue as a <code>CarePlan.description</code> and use separate care plans for each of the issues.<br>
Here is an example:<br>
<strong>Issue</strong>: Patient has no primary caregiver<br>
<strong>Goal</strong>: Identify primary caregiver<br>
<strong>Actions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine if this support deficit puts patient at increased risk for medical complications</li>
<li>Involve Social Worker on this issue</li>
<li>Involve Nurse Care Manager on this issue</li>
<li>Assist patient to identify possible primary caregivers</li>
</ul>
