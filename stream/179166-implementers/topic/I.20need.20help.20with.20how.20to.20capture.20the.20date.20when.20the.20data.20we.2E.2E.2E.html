<p>From: Olga Vovk &lt;<a href="mailto:ovovk@samvit-solutions.com">ovovk@samvit-solutions.com</a>&gt;<br>
Dear all,<br>
I need a help with  how to capture:</p>
<p>1.  The date when the data were last amended on the case report form (CRF).<br>
  2.  The person who made the above amendments.<br>
Here we are talking about answers for the questionnaire, not modifying the questionnaire itself.</p>
<p>I looked at both the  <a href="http://QuestionnaireResponse.author">QuestionnaireResponse.author</a> and QuestionnaireResponse.authored elements and they look like a good ones, however, I still have questions.<br>
These 2 elements have cardinalities 0..1, though there could be the use case when the questionnaire was 1) first completed and 2) then later amended.<br>
And I need to be able to capture both 1) and 2).</p>
<p>Please advise,<br>
Thank you!</p>
<p>Olga Vovk<br>

<p>Historical changes to any resource are usually captured through Provenance and possibly history.  The reality is that a CRF might be amended numerous times.  There's be a Provenance for each time the resource was stored with a date and a record of who made the change (and possibly why).  If the repository supports history, you'd also be able to see the specific version produced from that change.</p>
