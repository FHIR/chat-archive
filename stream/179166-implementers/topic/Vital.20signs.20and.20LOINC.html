<p>It is not clear to me if I HAVE to use LOINC codes for reporting a vital signs measurement in an Observation resource. This sentence <br>
"The following core profiles for the Observation resource have been defined as well. If implementations use this Resource when expressing the profile-specific concepts as structured data, they SHALL conform to the following profiles:"<br>
The Vital-Signs profile is the required profile.<br>
If I am making my own profile and using the Observation to report a vital signs measurement, do I have to (also) use a LOINC code to beFHIR compliant?</p>

<p>Yes.  The LOINC codes are intended to establish a minimal level of international interoperability around vital signs.  However, you're free to send additional codings for whatever other code systems are useful to you and those you exchange with.</p>

<p>Lloyd,<br>
When I brought this up at a European PCHA meeting last week there was opposition to this requirement. They have their own realm coding requirements.</p>

<p>They're not prohibited from meeting those requirements.  However, given that LOINC is free to everyone worldwide, that the number of codes to be mapped is small and that vital signs data is important to so many uses, it seems a reasonable imposition to ask implementations to include the indicated LOINC codes along with whatever other codes are required in a given jurisdiction/implementation environment.  While there's been some resistance, thus far there's been no indication from anyone that they <em>can't</em> meet the requirement for technical, legal or cost reasons.</p>

<p>Nothing to be said that has not already been said before. HL7 do not know or pay the cost of conformance in jurisdictions yet have the view that that cost is reasonable. The rationale for using LOINC on vital signs is weak and could easily be extended to anywhere else in the FHIR specifications.</p>

<p>So for us when using in national scale systems, off the top of my head...<br>
- we would first have to define and maintain a cross mapping between SNOMED &amp; LOINC<br>
- distribute and maintain the mapping, additional work for both ourselves and our suppliers<br>
- suppliers would then need to either extend their data model for this new code system or manage a mapping at the interface level<br>
- as we would be forcing suppliers to do this we would need to assure that they are doing it correctly. We would need more tests, the supplier would need more testing and we would have more overhead<br>
- suppliers would need to cater that for a set of arbitrary observations, we would call them "vital signs" and they would need to map them to LOINC. Not all the vital signs just the ones that another jurisdiction decided were vital signs.<br>
- we ourselves would need to create our own vital sign category which would overlap with the one imposed so we would need to have a "vital signs" category called something else.<br>
- we would need to explain this across our broad FHIR estate of RESTful, messaging and document solutions as we enter STU3.<br>
- we would need to explain why when we already have challenging volumetrics discussions we are proposing to add more payload that has no local value<br>
- we would have to explain to many different stakeholders that although as a jurisdiction where we are strongly pushing SNOMED we are confusing the task by at the same time asking for LOINC<br>
- extrapolate this across many different programmes of work national, regional &amp; local<br>
- and all of this so as to support LOINC which not a requirement of any of our programmes<br>
- and finally having to explain to our implementation community that we need to do this even though it adds no local value</p>
<p>The biggest issue though is having to explain why we are using a standard that used to be terminology agnostic, that may at any time mandate LOINC in other areas and as such impose further local challenges. </p>

<p>That's one option Richard, but another possibility is that implementers can just map each of their local codes for vital signs to LOINC at the same time they're mapping to SNOMED</p>

<p>I still think you're look at this the wrong way - as if LOINC is a thing. We just said, there's a value in having a magic value that identifies the key vital sign observations. And so we chose some magic codes. The fact that they're from LOINC is not significant. </p>

<p>"we ourselves would need to create our own vital sign category which would overlap with the one imposed so we would need to have a "vital signs" category called something else." - why?<br>
OK say in our locality we deem that head circumference is not a vital sign, yet the mandatory profile says we must categorise it as one. So when we retrieve observations using the "vital-signs" category we will get "head circumference" even though we do not necessarily want it. The only thing we can do is to add a new category for "our" vital signs and add it as a second category. So now we have two categories on all of the "HL7" categorised observations the one we actually want and the one the profile mandates we must put on it. This is caused by the arbitrary definition of which observations are deemed to be vital signs. Where did that list come from...?</p>

<p>I think it's certainly debatable whether head circumference is a vital sign - at least it wouldn't be in regard to the original meaning of the term (i.e. "signs that you are alive").  A point in time measurement of head circumference (or body weight or height) doesn't say anything about that.  But those are all useful measurements that are frequently (but not universally) grouped together and tracked with other measurements that certainly are vital signs like blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate.  Different institutions and groups do have differences in their lists and will want and need to customize the complete list according to their own view.</p>

<p>maybe if we modified the profile to have a "core" set of VS observations that everyone really does agree on (e.g. BP [diastolic/systolic], HR, RR, body temp, and likely also body weight and height/length) and allow the others to be optional, that might help Richard's (and other's) issue at least a little bit?<br>

<p>"and allow the others to be optional"  does not fix the issue.  They are still categorized as a VS if they are opted in.   another approach is to have mutliple categories for head circumference in Observation: one "vital signs", an one "our vitals slgns"</p>

<p>I agree that having a "core set" of vital signs doesn't mean that Richard won't have to have an additional category for "UK vital signs" (if the UK set includes something that isn't in the core set), but at least the UK wouldn't be forced to send a LOINC code for something like head circumference that they don't even consider to be a vital sign<br>

<p>So our objective is to ensure that a key subset of observations that HL7 considers to be vital signs are universally recognizable.  The "vital signs" category that HL7 defines applies to whatever HL7 decides to put in it.  It's perfectly reasonable to challenge whether head circumfrance should be considered a vital sign (though if not, what is it?) and whether it should be in the subset that's important enough to require universal interoperability.  Everyone else is free to define their own categorizations.  The benefit of doing so is they get tight control.  The drawback is they will have less interoperability with those categories.  Defining your own category won't remove the obligation to specify the HL7-defined category for those items HL7 Int'l has said fall into the vital signs profile.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  RE "It's perfectly reasonable to challenge whether head circumference should be considered a vital sign (though if not, what is it?)" &lt;= If we assume what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span> offered as the original definition of 'Vital Signs' (i.e. "signs that you are alive"), then head circumference falls into the same set of "non-vital" extended vital signs as height and weight, since a corpse may not have a pulse or a blood pressure, but they still have a height , a weight and (except for a few exceptional causes of death) a head circumference as well. So the question is, are we lacking a working definition of "Vital Signs" within the scope of the FHIR standard?  Did the "international committee" just review and approve an arbitrary set of measurements that "sounded like" 'Vital Signs' based on each voting member's individual definition of 'Vital Sign' without questioning what is or should/shouldn't be considered a Vital Sign in the scope of the standard?</p>

<p>Yes, we're obviously working off of the "expanded" definition of vital signs, not the "strict” (or maybe better “traditional") one, and I'm not objecting to that, since it's useful to do so - it's just that when you do there are no absolutely objective criteria to use to say what is and is not a vital sign, and different people and instutions have variations in their ideas and applications around that</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  It's not <em>me</em> that's imposing "a very narrow view" of vital.</p>
<p>And I don't think that we should use the loose interpretation of "Vital Signs" in MU 2015 as an excuse to perpetuate the problem by making it a part of the FHIR specification, and also that we can separate the core set of true vital signs from the extensions with a high degree of confidence based on the pretty much unanimous agreement (examples follow) that they are pulse rate, temperature, respiration rate, and blood pressure.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs">Wikipedia</a><br>
Vital signs (often shortened to just vitals) are a group of the 4 to 6 most important signs that indicate the status of the body’s vital (life-sustaining) functions. <br>
There are four primary vital signs: body temperature, blood pressure, pulse (heart rate), and breathing rate (respiratory rate), often notated as BT, BP, HR, and RR. However, depending on the clinical setting, the vital signs may include other measurements called the "fifth vital sign" or "sixth vital sign".  <br>
Vital signs are recorded using the LOINC internationally accepted standard coding system.</p>

<p>The vote I was referring to was actually the STU ballots where the profiles were approved.  Those are the votes that "count".  The purpose of Observation.category is to let clients filter results to types of observations they would typically expect to see together.  And in most systems that I'm aware of, height &amp; weight are typically captured alongside blood pressure and pulse rate.  (As opposed to labs or images or psychological assessments which typically each have their own separate storage locations and user interfaces.)  It may be that "vital signs" is an overly narrow lable for this category, but I'm not sure what the label should be instead.</p>

<p>Hello all, first-time participant here. I'm preparing a new vital sign panel observation to contain patient's daily activities commonly measured by the wearables (context is the Finnish PHR Project work). This panel will grab on a set of VS measurements, but will also include some other categories of observations. How would you as experts categorise e.g. 'steps taken' (has several LOINC codes with different context) or 'distance measured'? Or 'moderate-to-vigorous PA measured over 24h'? The local review team opinion in Finland is they wouldn't outright categorise those as vital signs, so we need alternative categories - or rather an opinionated answer via you experts here.</p>

<p>The category element is 0..* because there many axis on which to categorize stuff.  HR, RR, BP are vital signs but the could also and importantly be patient-reported.

<p>The idea with the Finnish PHR team is to derive all observations (so far all were purely vital-signs) from a common base observation. This discussion seems to drive towards defining another, differently named and categorised base observation for the kind of measurements I'm trying to 'observise'? That might be good also if the current strict list of UCUM units defined mandatory for vital signs in FHIR don't quite flex to - as such - fairly basic unit requirements the fitness/patient-reported category would need. I mean values like 'meters' (don't want to use centimetres for distance walked/exercised) or 'seconds' or 'minutes' for durations of different activity categories). Then on the other hand, some observations I plan to collect under a 'vital-sign panel' observation would probably be ok in either base observation track - could I 'mix and match' observations with nonsimilar categories to a single panel?</p>

<p>since category is 0..*  we can add as many valuesets as we want  (although I don't think the specification tooling  supports multiple bindings...yet) but the bindings can be no stronger than <code>referred</code> so not sure is that useful to provide more than a single binding.  May be more appropriate to use profiles to define them.</p>

<p>My questions are actually from a FHIR Core editor perspective.  .category has a Max of * so it should support multiple axis.   In the core spec we only get one bite at the apple when publishing a  valueset.  So proposing a second set of values is tricky although we could add something in the text somewhere.   A concept like fitness could capture more that just vitals so not appropriate to stick in the vitals profile in the FHIR spec.</p>

<p>Well this discussion has gone a lot further than I expected at the start. My original concern was the requirement to follow the vital signs profile when my Observation reported a measurement that was considered a vital sign. That includes the requirement of using LOINC in the code, UCUM in the code for the units of the valueQuantity, and specifying a category.</p>
<p>In the PCHA profile for reporting measurements from PHD devices (used primarily for remote patient monitoring) there is no category, and the MDC coding system is used. In the valueQuantity, we use MDC codes for the unit code and system, but we do optionally use UCUM in the unit string value to get the best of both worlds (if the UCUM transaltion is known). Since vital signs are fairly common, we are concerned about message bloat when we need to upload data from streaming pulse oximeters or heart rate monitors. Given that the MDC code specifies not only what the measurement is but also frequently the measurement technique (there are several codes that specify heart rate but they are different when the come from a pulse ox, ecg,  bp cuff, or activity monitor) thus we want to keep the MDC code. But that means doubling up on the code.coding and adding a category element.</p>
<p>In addition, LOINC codes are not provided by the devices, MDC codes are. If there is a future device that measures a heart rate in a different manner (say a continuous bp meter) today's gateway will not be able to map that device to the specified set of LOINC codes because it wont know that it is a vital sign and it will not know the mapping. It will, however, be able to create the MDC code for the Observation.code.coding.code element since it is provided by the device. It does not have to know what the code means.</p>
<p>As I look at the problem of requiring the vital signs profile its  more a matter of message bloat and future interoperability.  One thing the 11073 specifications have going for it is that it is extensible. Granted the end reader will have to be up to date with the latest codes, but the gateways in the field won't.</p>

<p>Those following the PCHA profile will as all the measurements are reported using the MDC nomenclature  codes There are many more measurement types than just vital signs). At least these codes follow a standard that is used in V2 messaging as well. We would rather put the burden on the reader than on the set of potentially thousands of remotely located gateways. As it is, the gateway has the challenge of handling the medical devices. It is PCHA's hope that more devices will eventually follow the standards. Today many do not and spit out their data in a proprietary manner. To work with these the gateways are already stuck with mapping to the MDC standard. Obviously there is no way an existing gateway can work with a new proprietary device.</p>
