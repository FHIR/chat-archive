<p>Hi,<br>
I noticed that the columns in the excel template spreadsheets do not necessarily correspond to the names used in the final JSON files (e.g. for extensions the "Display" column is used for the "title" field. I was just wondering if  there are plans to align the two or if there is a document somewhere that indicates these links?<br>
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>The Excel spreadsheets are intended for internal HL7 use only.  As the StructureDefinition resource evolves, it's much less work to update the extract code than it is to update all of the spreadsheets.  I don't think there's any plans to increase consistency.  And there is an intention to retire the use of spreadsheets for anything other than resource definition.  That doesn't mean it couldn't happen, just that it's not terribly high priority</p>
