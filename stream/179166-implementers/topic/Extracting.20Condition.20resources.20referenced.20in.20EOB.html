<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to write a query to retrieve and resolve the Condition resource referenced in ExplanationOfBenefit.diagnosis.diagnosisReference&gt;Condition. There is no search parameter for the 'diagnosisreference ' field in the resource. I am trying the revinclude option to fetch me the Condition resources referenced in ExplanationOfBenefit resource. The query is as follows:<br>
pd-fhir-viewer:8080/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir/Condition?_revinclude=ExplanationOfBenefit:Patient/PGXC12  When am executing this it returns all the condition resources in the server, rather than returning the specific Condition resource as referenced in the ExplanationOfBenefit resource. I am using the HAP FHIR and am going to post there as well but just wanted to check if the approach is right or if there is a better way of doing this. Thanks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both _include and _revinclude are based on search parameters, rather than paths in the resource, since joins, such as chaining, are already done by search parameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you cannot _revInclude EOB.diagnosis since there is no defined search parameter on it.</p>

<p>More specifically, to do that, the server would have to define its own search parameter - though that's a completely legal thing to do.</p>
