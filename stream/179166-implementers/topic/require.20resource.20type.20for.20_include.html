<p>Hey team, I have a question for implementing _include &amp; _revinclude search capability. <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#include">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#include</a><br>
In the doc, it mentioned that the 3rd part of the value will be the target resource type when there are multiple possible types. It indicates that this value is optional as the reference may only have one possible type, what I would like to confirm is would that become required when there are multiple possible types.<br>
We are considering the issue when we want to do token scope verification for _include references.</p>

<p>In my understanding, if the third part is omitted, then the value is *, i.e. there are no constraints on the type of resource being referenced by the 'reference' search parameter. As such the third part isn't required by the FHIR spec.</p>

<p>Yeah, that make sense, So regarding best practice for scope checking, we will need to verify if the token has the scope of the references after the result is formed instead of only using the request information. As it may be referencing any one(s) of the type.</p>
