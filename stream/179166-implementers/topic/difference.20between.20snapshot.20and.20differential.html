<p>Hallo, I am trying to understand the meaning of "snapshot" and "differential" in the StructureDefinitions and  I am a bit confused. As an example I looked at the definition of "Element" in the profiles-types.json-file. The only difference between snapshot and differential of the base "Element"-element is that the differential does not have the "base" and the "isModifiere" elements. Why do elements appear in both structures that are exactly alike ? I would have thought the snapshot only contains everthing that is new in the definition as a whole and the differential contains only the stuff that has changed regarding the super type.<br>
Greetings</p>

<p>Differential shows what's different from the base model.  Snapshot shows what happens when you apply the differential to the base.</p>

<p>what this means is that for the base type , differential and snapshot are not different</p>

<p>E.g. Resource, Element, etc. - types that don't inherit from anything else</p>
