<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> , when you have a chance could you please post where you stuck the new extension allowing a CapabilityStatement to link to related endpoints?</p>
<p>Thanks!  We're excited to give it a try.</p>
<p>For reference for others who weren't in the DevDays breakout session: this extension should allow FHIR servers that implement multiple FHIR versions at different endpoints the opportunity to tell clients where those endpoints are.  This is in contrast to the <code>$versions</code> operator that works when there are multiple versions supported at a single endpoint.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> , for reference, this discussion follows on from this previous discussion: <a href="#narrow/stream/4-implementers/subject/GF.2310205.20-.20Cardinality.20of.20Conformance.2Erest/near/164420" title="#narrow/stream/4-implementers/subject/GF.2310205.20-.20Cardinality.20of.20Conformance.2Erest/near/164420">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/4-implementers/subject/GF.2310205.20-.20Cardinality.20of.20Conformance.2Erest/near/164420</a></p>
<p>I would propose that the related endpoints extension have both computable and human-readable attributes, and be able to identify endpoints for several different use cases.  The computable part would enable client apps to quickly identify the endpoint with the features they need.</p>
<p>Obviously we've been talking about different endpoints for different <code>fhirVersion</code>s, but it could also potentially be useful to get more specific to the profile level.  You'd suggested it would be useful to show which endpoints share common OAuth tokens, and I definitely agree.</p>
<p>Another interesting use case would be if different endpoints support different parts of the spec, such as GraphQL.  For example, Asymmetrik's GraphQL server is a different codebase from the regular FHIR server because of the architecture we're using.  They could co-exist on the same server, but might have slightly different endpoints.</p>
<p>Thanks, looking forward to seeing what you come up with.</p>
