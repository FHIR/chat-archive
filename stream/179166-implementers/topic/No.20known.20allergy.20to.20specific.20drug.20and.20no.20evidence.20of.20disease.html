<p>Quick question about negating specific items. If one wanted a record that a specific AllergyIntolerance is not present, or a specific disease is not present, what is the ideal resource to contain or record that? The negation sections of AllergyIntolerance and Condition point to a list with 'NKDA' as as EmptyReason, but the use case is in reference to specific conditions or intolerances that must be either ruled out or addressed.</p>

<p>I think that what the AllergyIntolerance resource expects at the moment is that you'd use a single code 'no known allerges to [x]'</p>

<p>In context of AllergyIntolerance, there are multiple ways of handling negation as noted in <a href="http://build.fhir.org/allergyintolerance.html#9.1.3.3" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/allergyintolerance.html#9.1.3.3">http://build.fhir.org/allergyintolerance.html#9.1.3.3</a> - which is summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use AllergyIntolerance.code (CodeableConcept) -- as long as a code exists, such as SNOMED 716184000 for No Known Latex Allergy</li>
<li>Use the extension <a href="http://build.fhir.org/extension-allergyintolerance-substanceexposurerisk.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/extension-allergyintolerance-substanceexposurerisk.html">http://build.fhir.org/extension-allergyintolerance-substanceexposurerisk.html</a> -- this allows you to document both the specific drug (substance) and no-known-reaction-risk (exposureRisk)</li>
<li>Use List.emptyReason (not recommended, nor applicable when talking about a specific drug)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two primary ways of reporting "no known allergies" in the current specification: using the CodeableConcept, as described above, or using the List resource with emptyReason. The third available option is using the substanceExposureRisk extension. During the STU period, it is not recommended to use the List resource for "no known allergies" reporting purposes. The principal reason for this is to allow all allergy or intolerance data to be found and to be consistently queryable from the single location of the AllergyIntolerance resource</p>

<li>If the condition has been ruled out by diagnostic and clinical evidence, then you can use Condition.verificationStatus = refuted</li>
<li>It is common as part of checklists prior to admission, surgery, enrollment in trials, etc. to ask questions such as "are you pregnant", "do you have a history of hypertension", etc. This information should NOT be captured using the Condition resource but should instead be captured using QuestionnaireResponse or Observation.

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191403">@Michelle (Moseman) Miller</span> <br>
That extension on AllergyIntolerance will work well for my purposes.</p>
<p>Regarding condition however, the conditions we will be asking about have never been associated with the patient, so 'refuted' seemed like the wrong approach when I read the sections you quoted. The use case is a CDS service verifying that something like Superior Vena Cava Obstruction is absent. We would just like a record of confirmation that the condition is absent. If 'refuted' is the suggested approach, that works. I was also considering a 'No evidence of disease' Observation, with values of the condition codes. Kind of a point in time observation that the patient does not have the sequalae under consideration. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>I think Observation is reasonable, but there are multiple ways potentially to use it.  Observation code: 'no evidence of disease', valueCodeableConcept: 'disease code' is one possibility, but it sort of turns 'code' into a de facto "negation indicator".  Another possibility that has been discussed (by the VA and others) is to put the disease code (finding) in the 'code' element and then use a 'value' of "absent" or "not present" (or similar).  The most straightforward way might be to use a precoordinated code for "no evidence of xxx disease" (or equivalent), but then that could be either in 'code' or 'value'.  We probably should review the PCWG Negation work on this, and I think it still needs further discussion to determine the best approaches and how to interoperate between them.</p>

<p>I think that actually would be helpful, Michelle.  I think this ultimately will show that there are a lot of different approaches being used out in the field.  Providing usable guidance that can help to reduce the variability and improve interoperability  isn't particularly clear cut or easy, but still is a desirable goal.</p>

<p>I think it would be helpful to see all kinds of Observation examples. The specifics of Observations in FHIR made it tricky to cover all the types I've had to, particularly finding the 'code'/question field. That may be due to deficiencies in terminologies though. I think a set of valid, usable observations with different patterns of assertion or  code-value pairings would be helpful to give new FHIR implementers an idea of what is and is not a valid observation. It's easy to understand LOINC like observations with lab values, but Observation seems to be the best Resource choice for so many other types of subjective and objective findings. Lots of examples would be very helpful to differentiate what should be an Observation, what should be a Clinical Impression, what should be a Condition, etc.</p>

<p>Yes, those values make sense clinically (although that particular list is a bit of a random scattershot).  It would be helpful to have more specific code which indicate the intent of the particular observation being made and narrow the choice of possible values - but, again, there are lots of different ways that can be organized.</p>

<p>I should add that many are "one off" examples as I was just looking for any example where there was variance from the drafted guidance  (not taking volume into consideration).  I will keep sampling data to provide a few more examples as time allows, but as I mentioned before, as long as the guidance is just guidance, it will fit most (just not all) use cases where SNOMED is used as the Observation.code.</p>

<p>Sure, if SNOMED codes have been mapped.  Keep in mind much of this build is done using proprietary codes.  We map to standards (such as SNOMED) on an as needed basis.  For example:</p>

Observation.value = <br>
    SNOMED CT No (qualifier value) 373067005 <br>
    SNOMED CT Yes (qualifier value) 373066001 <br>
    or<br>
    Left at Home (not mapped yet, which might imply it would manifest as text only)<br>

<p>Hi, similar issue,<br>
I'm trying to understand how to best represent "Unknown Allergy"</p>
<p>Currently, the best way I can think to represent this is through SNOMED CT codes using the post-coordinated expression:<br>
609328004 | Allergic disposition (disorder) |<br>
410604004 | Subject of record (person) |<br>
413350009 | Finding with explicit context (situation) |<br>
261665006 | Unknown (qualifier value) |</p>
<p>Contextually, this relates to our organisation wanting to consistently represent the following concepts:<br>
- known allergies<br>
- no known allergies<br>
- unknown /not yet asked/ allergies not recorded<br>
- unable to load allergy data<br>
- conflicting results returned</p>

<p>By unknown allergy, do you mean that the patient experienced some allergic type event to a drug product, but the causal substance is not known? It sounds a bit more like an AdverseEvent. Or if there is some reaction that is going on, that could be a Condition. Or perhaps I'm not understanding the use case of 'Unknown Allergy'.</p>

<p>Unknown and no known are different clinical concepts.</p>
<p>Unknown - means no one has asked whether the patient has an allergy and it is unknown whether the patient has any allergies<br>
No known - means that a clinician has asked if the patient has an allergy and the patient has responded with something like "no, not that I know of"</p>

<p>Attempting to assign a clinical concept to the absence of any type of record, and treat it as a finding, might be heading down a slippery slope (the non-event driven health record)? However, I'm sure that this must have been the subject of many past (null flavor) debates and I'm also guessing that there is a good reason why it's not covered by a pre-coordinated SCT concept. There is also a non-clinical interpretation of "unknown allergy" as denoting the existence of an allergy that's not been completely diagnosed (e.g. I've got a nasty rash, which might be the result of an allergy but I haven't identified what caused it).</p>

<p>I agree, it does become complicated.<br>
The use case we are attempting to satisfy is something along these lines:</p>
<p>An allergy or allergies are incorrectly uploaded to a patient record. The GP then needs to delete all Allergies and the status is shown as "Nil Known Allergies". If, at that point the GP is unable to ask the patient about their Allergy status then the patient will have an incorrect status. This status indicates to users that the patient has been asked about their Allergy status and provided information that they have No known Allergies. This could result in a clinician not asking the patient about their Allergy status. A status of "Unknown" identifies that there is a task that needs to be completed for the patient i.e. to ask the patient about their Allergy status.</p>

<p>Another factor to consider is how this information might be presented to a Patient using a portal or PHR. For several years, my patient portal just displayed a count of '0' on the  Allergy Tab to indicate no records. That made perfect sense to me, because I realized that my GP hadn't asked me that question since I started using the portal and (meds aside) previous clinical records weren't uploaded to that portal product. Subsequently, I've been asked the question, it's been coded using  716186003 |No known allergy| and that term is presented to me by the portal. Granted, I may not be a typical patient, but that term will probably be easily understood by most; "allergy unknown" or "status of [xx] unknown" may make less sense to the average patient?</p>

I agree with the above, that we should also consider what makes most sense to a patient and a "No known allergy" concept would be clear to most English speaking patients.</p>
<p>For the purposes of information display to a patient, "No known allergy" makes sense because the clinician has done something to confirm with you, as a patient, about what you know about your own allergies<br>
For the purposes of information display to a clinician, there needs to be more detail to determine whether this "No known allergy" has actually been confirmed with the patient. If the a clinician has not attempted to clarify the patient's allergy status, then we need to show this to the clinician to clearly specify that the clinician needs to find out more information about a patient's allergies based on something like an "Allergy status unknown" concept.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191360">@Michelle M Miller</span>,<br>
I have reviewed this spec and it is helpful to understand this for the purposes of FHIR enabled systems. Our current requirement is requiring mapping from FHIR to v2.x through an integration engine.</p>
<p>Clinical Use Case - 'Delete' incorrect allergy details against an individual patient's record within a CIS. They want to have this displayed in such a way that represents "This patient's allergy status is unknown" to communicate to other clinicians that they need to confirm the patient's allergy status. </p>
<p>Based on the clinical use case above - technically in the Clinical Data Store - we cannot simply 'delete' and leave the allergy as an empty field. We need to display this to reflect the above unknown allergy status for this patient. Since our system is translating from FHIR to v2.x through the IE, we need a consistent semantic value.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions of how this could be represented? In a post-coordinated SNOMED CT expression, or even the individual "Unknown" SNOMED CT within an AL1 segment?</p>

<p>I saw the List stuff but I guess I didn't fully understand that.  Is the intent that if a client does a search on AllergyIntolerance, that the server can return either a Bundle of AllergyIntolerance resources, or a List?  Or a Bundle with a single List entry?  Wouldn't it make more sense to have a Bundle.emptyReason instead of flipping the entire output over to a List?</p>
<p>And I guess I wasn't clear that the bit about negated allergies would also apply to the "Allergies Reviewed, None Identified" resource.  The STU note discourages Lists:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>STU Note: ... During the STU period, it is not recommended to use the List resource
 for &quot;no known allergies&quot; reporting purposes.
</pre></div>


<p>so we looked at using the CodeableConcept, which I think means to send an actual AllergyIntolerance resource.  The phrase in the note "using the CodeableConcept, as described above" is a bit unclear about what description above it is referring to.  I was assuming it was referring to the use of AllergyIntolerance.code = 716186003 |No known allergy.  I do like that approach over Lists, but then you have to refute that resource once you document an allergy, so if someone does an AllergyIntolerance.create to add an allergy, the server may need to automatically delete/refute the NKA one, otherwise allergy documentation is in a wonky state.</p>
