<p>There is a JIRA (<a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-31866">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-31866</a>) that proposes to remove Statistics as a data type and include its content as a BackboneElement in Evidence as Evidence is the only resource that uses the Statistics data type.  Before that is finalized we would like to get feedback whether there is any consideration at this time, or use of an extension already, where Observation.value[x] contemplates the use of valueStatistics essentially, or already is doing so.<br>
The leaning in the Orders and Observation workgroup discussion is that there is no intent and that a use case where Statistics context is relevant it can be done outside Observation.value[x], e.g., introducing by extension or core attribute Observation.analysis Reference(Evidence).  We are not aware of such a use case at this time though.</p>
<p>Any input on current/future plans will help determine whether OO should or should not support the JIRA's proposal.</p>
