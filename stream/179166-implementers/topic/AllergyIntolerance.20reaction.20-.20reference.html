<p>Shouldn't AllergyIntolerance.reaction also allow for a reference to Observation? Normally the Observation is found and entered first, only then we assert an allergy. Shouldn't we simply reuse Observation information there?</p>

<p>In a tutorial today I saw the case of capturing a reaction and only then inferring the allergy. I think it really makes sense. If in a series of consultations you a) make an observation of a reaction and b) infer an allergy because of that, why not reusing data?</p>

<p>I agree with you. My personal use-case is getting tested for allergy to 'shellfish' there was an observation made of that test, and that observation moved my AllergyIntolerance severity from patient-suspects, to High Severity. My CDA summary does show the relationship between the Allergy and the Observation... so there is use like this in CDA (Epic).</p>

<p>Strangely enough, we just had a use case pop up for this.  An implementer wants to tie the MedRequest/Admin to the allergic reaction.  They can do that, but there is no way to associate that reaction with the allergyIntolerance.  So there is nothing to link the MedRequest with the Allergy which I would think we should do through the actual reaction.</p>

<p>I just came upon this topic, too. We are currently profiling a WoundSummary where we want to capture the (allergic) reaction to wound dressing material. The symptoms in this context may be captured by a nurse or a wound manager. That it is a reaction to formerly added dressing material has to be infered by a physician, a nurse is not allowed to do so. So I would like to add references<br>
(a) to the "substance" AND<br>
(b) to the "manifestation"<br>
in reaction.</p>

<p>From this thread it seems that it would make sense to allow a link to an observation, instead of forcing people to re-enter information in the .reaction. I think this is an oversight in the current specification.</p>

<p>Revisiting Decisions<br>
a) It is recognized that revisiting previously made decisions inhibits progress and should be<br>
discouraged. That said, circumstances might exist that warrant re-opening discussion on a<br>
previously resolved issue.<br>
b) To dissuade this practice, such re-opening requires a formal motion, second, and two-thirds (66%)<br>
majority affirmative vote subject to the quorum rules in this document.<br>
c) For the decision to revisit a previous decision to be considered binding, advance notification as<br>
specified in Meeting Notifications (section 3) is required.<br>

WG determines that the new discussion represents the same range of views as addressed in the<br>
original decision. </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> Do you have a system that actually links together its Allergy records with diagnoses or problems?  If so, just submit a new change request and point to the old one indicating that there's no evidence that the "no systems do this" assertion is incorrect.   (I'd phrase it as asking for an extension, because I'm pretty sure it's not an 80% situation.)</p>
<p>If you're proposing it as a good idea/logical thing to do, then I think there's no action to take because the decision to add it needs to be based on a real implementer requirement, not a notion of something that might be desireable.</p>

<p>I have no stigma with extensions, I just think we missed a spot there. <br>
But others have pointed it out in this stream so I will not be the only one to push it.</p>

<p>That's base FHIR methodology.  We try very hard to not have core 'lead' the community.  That's not to say it can't ever happen, but it's something we're super cautious about - because it's a super-slippery slope that leads to overly complex specs, a disconnect with the real world and - correspondingly - lower adoption.</p>

<p>I understand. Besides my project, the same question appeared in a presentation at devdays, and the few other people commenting in this thread. I see it not as leading the community, but responding.<br>
While I believe this should be in core, we should at least get feedback "we'd like to confirm that people are not using this" and get a more significant sample.</p>

<p>The reality as we've been aware of it in the Patient Care discussions on this is that most systems seem to be recording the reactions at the same time as the allergies themselves.  If there are observations that are made prior to determining that there is an allergy (which certainly happens), it seems that typically there isn't an effort made to link the allergy record to those prior observations.  That fits pretty well with what we have right now in the AllergyIntolerance resource.  That's my take on the conclusions from the prior discussions, anyway.</p>
