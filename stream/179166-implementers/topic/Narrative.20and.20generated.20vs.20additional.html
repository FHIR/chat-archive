<p>We ran into this question internally and wanted to check with the group. When we build our Narratives, we have several that include fields that are simply "code" in FHIR. For these, most of the time we were looking up the display for that code/system in the Narrative. This isn't in the actual body of the FHIR resource anywhere, but we think this still matches the idea of "generated"</p>

<p>However, if we take that idea one step further... what happens if we pulled the display from our internal display? This would be equivalent to a .text field if the field was a codeableConcept, and it's often what matches how we would display it internally. Is this still "generated?"</p>

<p>The question is - could a receiving system render the data itself and suppress the narrative and have the user safely informed of what's going on.  Looking up an external display where the amount of information in the display isn't different than the default display should therefore be fine.  On the other hand, looking something up and adding a bunch of extra information would count as "additional".</p>

<p>So, for example, looking up a code and returning the drug name would be fine.  But returning a list of the active ingredients and generic alternatives with prices would definitely be "additional"</p>

<p>The most common example of this for us is the resource status. So, taking MedicationRequest.status. If entered-in-error, the "standard" display is Entered in Error. In our System, this is usually displayed as "Voided with Results" or "Cancelled" (depending on workflow). It can be more specific as a display, but the underlying FHIR coded status is the same.</p>

<p>and since a "code" field can never provide a display within the body of the resource, this is a bit different than the example above - that's a codeable concept and the first part you mention may be a "display" while the second could conceivably (maybe not correctly?) be provided as text on the Medication.code field.</p>

<p>b/c that would indicate it isn't granular enough. The narrative is the fallback, not the primary way to show things to the user. Most of our apps don't use our narrative at all.</p>

<p>Ok, now one more question. What about when the narrative is in a different language than the resource itself? :)</p>

<p>I think that's not a great idea.  The language of the data and the narrative should be the same.  We allow translations of strings.  I don't know if we've explicitly provided for the notion of translations of Narrative - but I'd certainly be in favor of us allowing that.  (And if we're going to make a major change like that, this is certainly the time to raise it...)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  We're doing this for narrative in limited situations.

<p>"The narrative content SHOULD be in the language of the resource, but there is no reason to expect that HTML type tooling would understand the resource language element. For this reason, a lang attribute on the &lt;div&gt; SHOULD also be used (see the note in the HTML 5 specification about use of language )."</p>

<p>Reasoning: if the app doesn't understand the resource, the narrative should hopefully be in the end user's lang, assuming there is one provided. We assume that if the app understands the resource, they would be doing number formatting/translation of labels for their own display</p>

<p>Hopefully, most of the time the language of the resource and the narrative are the same... But I can see this being needed for consumer views of FHIR data. I saw the other thread on narrative translation</p>
