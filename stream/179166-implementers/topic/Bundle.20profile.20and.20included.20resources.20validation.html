<p>Hi,<br>
Is it formal to create a bundle document profile (prescription) where the included resources (patient, practitioner etc.) have different profiles than the actual base resource profiles?<br>
For example I want to eliminate the required information (elements) for patient and practitioner only inside the prescription bundle document but when I process patient resource outside bundle document to validate against the actual base resource. <br>
As far as I understand profiles are required for this scenario.</p>

<p>Typically a prescription wouldn't be represented as a Bundle, but you certainly can.  You <em>can't</em> eliminate required elements with a profile, you can only tighten things down.  It's certainly possible to have different profiles for data exchanged in a particular document from what you expect in other contexts.</p>

<p>Thank you, I understand that "..You can't eliminate required elements with a profile.." in the context of the official FHIR resource specs, but what if I have different profile for the bundle and eliminate elements only to included patient resource (not the base FHIR specs but required from the patient custom resource profile), and have different custom profile for patient for other proposes like patient CRUD operations with required the additional elements?<br>
Actual the question that arises is if I can “constrain” an included resource to bundle only in the context of a bundle using bundle profile without of course brake the base FHIR requirements.</p>

<p>It's totally fine if content inside your document isn't valid against the requirements you'd expect if it were posted to your RESTful endpoint.</p>
