<p>Hi,  I asked on Jan 14 this question in the Da Vinci ATR and the response leads me to asking this question as a whole.  Should an identifier for any resource be unique within that resource for a FHIR repository?  I am not asking about the resource id.  I am asking about the type of identifier (2.24.0.12)which is described as "The value SHALL be unique within the defined system..."  I have understood this to mean that any identifier for a resource- for Patient: a medical record number, a drivers license as examples- must be a unique identifier that matches (with the system and possibly period or other ameliorating properties) to one and only one resource.  Is this true?</p>

<p>Short answer is "it depends".  Something like an order number <em>should</em> be unique.  On the other hand, something like medical license number might not be - because there might be multiple PractitionerRole instances that correspond to the same individual (with different roles and/or time-periods).</p>

<p>In the II workgroup, we couldn't identify a restriction that identifiers be unique, and actually added a comment to point that out to people who might be more used to DICOM where a particular study UID will only occur once in an archive, and warn them that they may get multiple ImagingStudy resources with the same identifier.</p>
