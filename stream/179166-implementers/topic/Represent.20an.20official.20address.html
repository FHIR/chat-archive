<p>We are looking into representing Norwegian addresses in FHIR by profiling the Address Datatype. In our HL7 Norway workshop one result was the need to represent official address for a person /organization, typically this will be the address that person/organization reports to some official registry. The problem here is that there is no way in the Valueset to represent an official address in address.use(or address.type). using the required ValueSets. In the Netherlands this was solved by defining an extension to represent official, a boolean value. We will have to do something similar if the valuesets can not be extended with an official use.</p>

<p>What is the general consensus, should we just use an extension for this or is this a more common use-case that should be supported in the required ValueSet used by the Address DataType?</p>
<p>Would love to have some input on this from other countries.</p>

<p>Vietnam has the concept of 'your registered address' which is different from where you actually live or work. This sounds like the same idea - so you could propose a 'registered' address.  I believe that this is a chinese thing too (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192103">@Lin Zhang</span> ?)</p>
