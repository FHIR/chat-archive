<p>So using the AuthorizationInterceptor works great for catching declaring resources. One interesting caveat seems to be when it comes to operations like <code>http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/metadata</code></p>
<p>In this case, the CapabilityStatement that is returned isn't really a "resource" per say, but rather is an operation called "metadata." I don't see a means to allow operations through than by checking the requestDetails for the operations and allowing "return new RuleBuilder().allowAll("Allow access to metadata").build();" </p>
<p>Allowing just "new RuileBuilder.allow("Allow access of CapabilityStatement resource type.").read().resourcesOfType(CapabilityStatement.class).withAnyId();" does not work because the resource isn't identified, and when I tried to identify it against the resources, combining and extending with "CapabilityStatementRestSecurityComponent" and "IResourceProvider" throws a contractual failure because the returned object is a "OperationDefinition" type. </p>
<p>What is the proper way to allow operations against "metadata" through?</p>

<p>Disregard. Didn't realize there was a special builder method of ".metadata()" against the RuleBuilder. That seems more logical.</p>
