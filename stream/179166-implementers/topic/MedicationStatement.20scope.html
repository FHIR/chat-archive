<p>MedicationStatement seems to be just for medications and other drugs. Should it include supplements?</p>
<p>There seems to be no way to record a statement about the use of a non-medication. Is there a need for a DeviceStatement ?

<p>Ah DeviceUseStatement for appliances and devices. </p>
<p>And for supplements? Widen the scope of MedicationStatement?</p>

<p>What is  the use case for DeviceStatement.   We have been scratching our heads over when that would be used.  If Grandma gets a new walker or artificial hip - would my system record that?  would it be an observation or special thing which parallels medicationStatement ?.  We have not moved forward on it  ( it is officially pending approval by FMG)  until we can figure out what it is good for...</p>

<p>Re supplements  - I would think medstatement covers that as well as weed and aspirin</p>

<p>I can only guess as to possible uses for DeviceStatement. I like the approach of leaving it as it us until a plausible use is found for it.</p>

<p>DeviceUseStatement was created by the CDS work group because they have a need to capture metrics about whether recomendations about the use of a device have been followed.  The problem is that there isn't necessarily a standard way such information is recorded - if it's recorded at all.  So the resource didn't necessarily originate based on what systems typically do.</p>
