<p>I am new to this forum, please advice if any standard needs to be followed whilst asking a question in the forum.</p>
<p>The doctor I work with wants to monitor the patient with a transplanted organ over encounters/visits. <br>
How do we handle this as a condition? This is not about collecting the complications of transplant as a surgery or post transplant complications like rejection but rather monitoring his labs and symptoms that suggests complications. <br>
How should we visualize a patient who is carrying a donor organ in order to just collect the history of their transplant as a snomed semantic tag "Situation"?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="195909">@Vaibhav K</span>, since you asked, there are a set of guidelines for forum posts and for asking questions that can be found <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Chat.fhir.org_community_expectations" target="_blank" title="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Chat.fhir.org_community_expectations">here</a> and <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Rules_for_asking_questions" target="_blank" title="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Rules_for_asking_questions">here</a>.  </p>
<p>The simplest way to group resources for something like that is to treat the transplant as an EpisodeOfCare (in this case, an episode that will presumably span the remainder of the patient's life).  The challenge will be ensuring that potentially relevant information is appropriately tagged by labs and others.  The alternative is to tag information on receipt so that it can be grouped, navigated and reported.</p>
