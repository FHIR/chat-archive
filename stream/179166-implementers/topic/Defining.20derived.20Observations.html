<p>Does anybody know of any work done in the area of defining derived Observations?  </p>
<p>For example, take the concept of BMI.  BMI is a derived value based off of height and weight and this value could be calculated using something along the lines of CQL.   Is there a way to define not the specific instance of a BMI Observation, but more along the lines of a definition of the Observation along with the CQL that would be used to calculate the value for a specific instance? </p>
<p>I see ObservationDefintion in the spec and would imagine that applying an extension or 2 could enable this type of use.  Is there any reason not to use ObservationDefinition for this?  Has anyone done anything similar to this using ObservationDefintion or another means?</p>

<p>What do you want to define? The code/concept of BMI, or its calculation formula?</p>

<p>I understand how to define CQL so that is not the issue.  What I'm looking for is a way to define a template for an Observation along with the CQL the would be used to populate the value for the Observation.  ObservationDefinition seems like this would be a logical fit as I could define the code/concept of an Observation and add an extension to it to define the CQL that would be used to derive the value.</p>

<p>Does anybody see a reason why ObservationDefinition shouldn't be used like this?</p>

<p>In terms of representing the answer, unfortunately Observation.derivedFrom is limited to Reference(DocumentReference | ImagingStudy | Media | QuestionnaireResponse | Observation | MolecularSequence). That would work for your BMI example, but would not work for many other derived Observations.</p>
