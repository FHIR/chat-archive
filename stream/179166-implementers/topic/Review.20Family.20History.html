<p>We need help deciding which resource to use to update that someone has reviewed the entire Family History list.  Originally we thought to use FamilyMemberHistory, but the data we need to capture is not at the individual record level (it is at the Profile level).  The option that will be in UI is "Confirm no changes."  This option will need to capture a Reviewed Date/Time, Reviewed Author (e.g. Practitioner reference), and a Patient reference.  We will need to build both a POST and a GET.  Any suggestions are appreciated.</p>

<p>This could be recorded as an Observation, I think.</p>

<p>Or Task.  Task lets you capture both the 'please review' as well as ticking the box when the review is done.  However, a positive statement of "no changes are needed" would be appropriate as an Observation.</p>
