<p>we have in our database multiple condition types such as</p>
<p>problem,<br>
socialHistory,<br>
functionalStatus,<br>
cognitiveStatus,<br>
chiefComplaint,<br>
diagnosis,<br>
reaction</p>
<p>should we only output under conditions specific types, or we can output all of the above? not sure if there is a definition to that in FHIR</p>

<p>Social history is more a status for observations than conditions.  "chief complaint" is a relationship of a Condition or Observation to a particular Encounter or Claim, not something that's intrinsic to the Condition or Operation itself.  Similarly, Reaction is something that's asserting a relationship between a Condition and a medication or some other intervention and would typically be captured by linking from AllergyIntolerance or AdverseEvent.  CognitiveStatus and FunctionalStatus are categories that can apply to observations. I suppose you could use them in Condition.category as well if you wanted.  'problem' and 'diagnosis' are already existing category codes.</p>
