<p>I have a use case to define a patient's membership in a health plan, a Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH), or a treatment program (e.g., HIV program, diabetes treatment program), etc. One issue is to determine the time enrolled in the program and the final date of enrollment. I have been looking at the FHIR Organization resource in which organization has many options for definition and there are multiple organization types based on the value set (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/organization-definitions.html#Organization.type" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/organization-definitions.html#Organization.type">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/organization-definitions.html#Organization.type</a>). A few questions:</p>

<p>1. Can I use the Organization Resource to request start and stop time for participation in the 'organization' (i.e., participation period)?</p>

<p>2. Will an EHR or financial application store the enrollment date and expiration date for participation in a health plan? in a treatment program for which specific payment is applied? A PCMH?</p>

<p>3. The definition for organization type is quite broad - should it apply to treatment programs or is there another resource that would be better?</p>

<p>4. Is there some standard value set of types of treatment programs, health plans, etc?  The Public Health Data Standards Consortium developed a value set for payer types (now included in VSAC) -is the Organization resource intended to use that value set or is there a more specific one?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193481">@Floyd Eisenberg</span> , Organization resource is not intended to be used for to represent membership in a health plan or any program. I think you should look into Coverage for membership in a health plan.</p>

<p>For example, this would be an insurance company that provides a plan/coverage to a patient.</p>

<p>So the organization would be the identifier for the insurance company.  And it would have a coverage?  I'm confused.  Note - the use case is also to determine the patient is managed by a specific organization (clinical practice, etc). So what resource is used there?</p>

<p>Period is an optional element. If you don't have this information, you don't have to populate it.<br>

<p>Will need to review with others - Care plan is not what I was seeking - it is patient specific. I need a program that is applied to multiple patients and may use multiple care plans.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be thinking HealthcareService as that is not patient related. I think the resource you are looking for is <code>EpisodeOfCare</code>.<br>
This is what we use for enrolment in a specific program in our solutions. (community care programs, Aged Care programs, rehabilitation programs etc)<br>
It has the details of the patient, the organization, the period of time, and its purpose (EoC.type).</p>
