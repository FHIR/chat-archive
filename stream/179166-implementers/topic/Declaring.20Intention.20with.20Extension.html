<p>Is there a way of declaring the intent of an Extension when creating one? Some will be created just to solve some local or system specific business requirement, but many are really needed to support common requirements. A sign of this is of course all the official extensions. </p>
<p>As a part of Swedish profiling, we see that we have the same requirement as our Dutch friends in stating that an address is "official" (<a href="http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-address-official" target="_blank" title="http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-address-official">http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-address-official</a>). We are having a discussion on how to handle our common requirement, but we agree that a common/official extension would be good. </p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br>
Is there a structured way of declaring the intent of an extension (e.g. Local/National/International, Local/Official etc)? This could make it easier to reuse extensions instead of creating new ones, as well as might help the creators of extensions to create them in a more generic way and add their local information in their profiles instead.</p>

<p>If you're seeing a need for an extension that spans multiple countries, that's a good argument for proposing it as a "standard" extension and submitting it for publication by HL7 using the 'propose a change' link.</p>
