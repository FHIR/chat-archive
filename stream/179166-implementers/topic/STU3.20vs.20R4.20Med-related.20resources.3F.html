<p>Is there a guide that helps navigate all the differences between STU3 and R4 medication-related resources?   I've already looked at the R3 Diff tab but the problem there is that each property is taken in isolation, e.g. Medication.amount was added and Medication.ingredient.amount was deleted --- does this really mean that the .amount property replaces the ingredient.amount property?   (as usual, we're trying to understand the impact of how we map existing HL7 med-related messages from STU3 to R4 so the R3 Diff table isn't necessarily sufficient to figure this out.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span>  - I was hoping you had the answers to this or a document or webpage that shows it :-)    I don't have this in my job description (spending time on standards effort; sometimes I wish I did).    It's actually quite hard to figure out the differences between 2 versions of the FHIR specs -- in our case STU3 to R4.   I just realized that it's also not as simple as looking at the "R3 Diff" tab on each resource because there are also difference in the datatypes used by these resources, e.g. Dosage for Med-related resources.    The other problem it that it seems sometimes the tooling says one property was added (e.g. MedReq.encounter) and the other was deleted (MedReq.context) when it seems like that should be a property name change.   Then there's the case of a new or changed name to a resource, e.g. ProcedureRequest to ServivceRequest; from the FHIR spec pages I'm not sure how anyone would figure that out and there's not a way to see if the properties between the two have changed without doing it manually (it seems unless I'm missing something)</p>

<p>I was informed that there is a place on the FHIR pages that has the complete listing of STU3 to R4 changes, including datatype changes.   This is more convenient that going to each resource's "R3 Diff" tab,   <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/diff.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/diff.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/diff.html</a></p>
<p>However, this doesn't solve the problem of trying to figure out if an add/delete is really a rename and if an STU3 resource was renamed, e.g. ProcedureRequest to ServiceRequest and then, if so, which properties were added in the new resource.</p>
<p>How are others dealing with trying to understand the STU3 to R4 differences when evaluating the effort to migrate from one to the other?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  (when you get a chance -- I know you just came back from holiday)</p>
<p>I used a 'hack' to find the differences between ProcedureRequest and ServiceRequest --- I used an online text comparison tool to compare the JSON from each resource.    I would have used a JSON comparison tool but the JSON on the FHIR website is "illegal JSON" (since JSON doesn't support comments but understand why it's there).    Would it be possible to have a download button on the "JSON" tab to have 'pure JSON' without the comments so that we could use that to do JSON comparisons to determined release differences?</p>

<p>you are referring to the JSON template, I think, which is a long way further away from being valid JSON than just that</p>

<p>The 'stylized JSON' that shows up under the JSON tab on any resource page, e.g. <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medicationrequest.html#tabs-json" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medicationrequest.html#tabs-json">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medicationrequest.html#tabs-json</a></p>
<p>(I think I see what you mean -- it also has 'pseudo references' to other resources and datatypes that are not 'real JSON' I guess either.)</p>
