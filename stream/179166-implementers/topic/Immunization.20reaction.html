<p>Hi all,<br>
shouldn't Immunization.reaction have a reference to AllergyIntolerance? </p>
<p>Actually,  in R4 specs, it only have a reference to Observation, however, it states that: "Immunization.reaction may be an indication of an allergy or intolerance. If this is deemed to be the case, a separate AllergyIntolerance resource instance should be created to indicate it, as most systems will not query against past Immunization.reaction."</p>
<p>How can I relate the Immunization.reaction with its AllergyIntolerance if we do not have such reference?<br>
Thanks in advance</p>

<p>I'd like some clinician input, but I don't think that the allergy is the same as a reaction to a vaccine. We do have a Jira ticket (<a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-28093">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-28093</a>) to change reaction to a CodeableConcept to allow a coded value but we weren't planning on adding a reference to AllergyIntolerance. There are notes in the Jira ticket from discussions with the Patient Care WG and if I recall, we drew some similarities between AllergyIntolerance.reaction and Immunization.reaction.</p>
