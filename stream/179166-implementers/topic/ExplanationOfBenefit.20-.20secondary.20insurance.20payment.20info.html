<p>Beside a primary insurance payment, it is quite common to have a secondary and in rare case a tertiary plan coverage payment (and including similar set of info such as co-insurance, co-payment, deductible, etc., that apply to non-primary payment processing). Is it something we would/could consider for ExplanationOfBenefit (EOB) resource? The data could be in both EOB level and Item level.</p>

<p>Each insurer could/would issue an EOB. Also, each insurer would issue a ClaimResponse. So if you have a 4th insurer in a Coordination of Benefit chain they would receive a Claim which contains a list of all coverages and includes the ClaimResponses for each of the preceding coverages. The EOB is a statement from an insurer as to what they received and their per item adjudication details, plus optional plan-account balances. The adjudication details could include the total payable by preceding insurers.</p>
<p>Can you give us examples of standards which already support the provision of adjudication information about other insurers in a given insurer's EOB?</p>

<p>I send an example to <span class="user-mention" data-user-email="c776168@trbvn.com" data-user-id="523">@paul</span>. The adjudication details under EOB <strong>item</strong> property can be used for Coordination of Benefit (COB) of a service. However, there is no property under EOB level can apply for total COB. Also, what is intended usages for <strong>addItem</strong> and could it be applied for COB?</p>
