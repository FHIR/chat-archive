<p>If HL7 is paid then why FHIR is free? what is the credibility and security of FHIR, can you let me know?</p>

<p>FHIR is an Interoperability Standard specification. I think you might be confusing this with a software product.</p>

<p>I'll take a stab at this. The reason the FHIR API and resource definitions are free is because if they were proprietary, then nobody would implement them.  HL7 is a not-for profit, industry funded organization to promote the exchange of clinical data (among other things I imagine). If you had to license the ability to use FHIR then there would be less adoption, less adoption would mean less interoperable, which would be contrary to HL7 goals.</p>
<p>I don't know how to answer the "credibility and security of FHIR" question. HL7 doesn't guarantee security in any way, security is implemented by each implementer. You have to decide whether you trust the security of _your implementation_ and the security of _every other implementation_ that you interact with, HL7 can't do that for you.</p>

<p>In some cases, security isn't that relevant - e.g. hosting a read-only interface of information that's public knowledge.  There's a whole section in the FHIR specification dealing with security considerations.  Implementation Guides may set specific security expectations based on their particular threat environment.</p>
<p>FHIR being 'free' is actually an innovation in the standards space.  Prior to the existence of FHIR, you needed to pay to have access to any of HL7's standards - which greatly diminished the set of potential implementers.  (Though even with that limitation, HL7 v2 and CDA both managed a significant degree of success.)  When FHIR was introduced, we wanted to ensure that it was easily accessible to app developers, the open source community and others for whom registration fees to access and use the standard would be a significant barrier.  When the intellectual property for FHIR was transferred to HL7, it was done on the condition it be made freely available.  A few years after that decision, HL7 opted to make all of its intellectual property available for free, though only FHIR and its IGs are licensed under Creative Commons 0 (i.e. fully public domain) licenses.  HL7 is now funded by those who choose to be benefactors, those who pay so they can participate in the standards balloting process (to have a greater say in how the standard evolves), through grants from organizations like the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator, and through funding from education services and conferences.</p>

<p>Thank you guys, this information was very helpful.</p>
