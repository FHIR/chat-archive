<p>I have asked a similar question on another topic but marked it as a resolved topic because the focus of that question was based on the Patient resource. So I will ask a similar question but this time with the focus on the _element parameter.</p>
<p>Suppose that we are going to retrieve all patients who have at least one QuestionnaireResponse.item.answer = 'A' AND the corresponding question (i.e., Questionnaire.item.text) = 'Q'".</p>
<p>Is that wise/doable to use the _element parameter like the following to meet the above-mentioned request:</p>
<p>[Base]/QuestionnaireResponse?item.answer=A&amp;questionnaire.item.text=Q&amp;_elements=patient</p>

<p>QuestionnaireResponse has no top-level element named "patient" and so this query is not correct.  You could replace "patient" with "subject" and then I think it would work.  In general, <code>_elements</code> is just a way to get SUBSETTED resources back...I'd think of it as an optimization.</p>

<p>I was testing the query and faced an issue. As far as I understand, the "item" is not in the QuestionnaireResponse's "Search Parameters". In this case, wouldn't it be possible to query the QuestionnaireResponse resource based on its "item" element?</p>

<p>item is not normally a searchable parameter, although it's possible that a system may support it.  So, searching by individual response to a question is unlikely to work.  Likley, you would have to search for all patients that have answered the linked questionnaire and then query all those questionnaireResponses and filter down client-side to those that answered the way you wanted</p>

<p>David, I don't understand this part of your response: "search for all patients that have answered the linked questionnaire and then query all those questionnaireResponses". What do you mean by "linked questionnaire" and also what do you mean by "those questionnaireResponses"? Would you explain more, please?</p>

<p>You would need to search for the questionnaireResponses for a given questionnaire, search locally for the answer you want, then query for the patients that have the wanted QuestionnaireReponses</p>
