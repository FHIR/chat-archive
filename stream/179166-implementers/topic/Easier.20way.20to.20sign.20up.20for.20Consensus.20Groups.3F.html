<p>I was just on the HL7 Ballot Consensus Group page and it's a little bit of a 'pain' to sign up for the set of ballot groups; you have to click on each one you want to signup for; one at a time using mouse clicks.   It would be much more useful (easier) if these signup ballots were organized into subgroups, e.g. FHIR, V2, V2, etc. and then have a 'check all' button that would allow you to more easily check all boxes without needing to do them one-at-a-time.  (it seems like there are over 30 ballot groups this time).   I don't know where to put this request since this is not FHIR-specific but thought the folks here would know.   Is this or can this be done with a GForce item or is there a separate mechanism to send feedback to the folks who maintain the <a href="http://HL7.org" target="_blank" title="http://HL7.org">HL7.org</a> website?</p>

<p>Hl7 recently let a contract to gather requirements to replace the ballot desktop so I doubt they're planning enhancements of the existing tool.  You could email your suggestion to the Web master and they might be able to feed that into the requirements project as a nice to have.</p>

<p>That strangely enough is intentional as we used to have a button to allow people to sign up for all ballot items.  This resulted in people just blindly joining every pool and then not voting or abstaining on most of the ballots.  We removed that so that you now have to intentionally join a ballot pool.<br>
As Lloyd suggested, there is a project team in place that is gathering requirements and I'm leading that team so I'll take your suggestion into account.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192166">@Jean Duteau</span>  -- thanks for taking this requirement to the team.   Yes, some people are on the side of 'sign up for everything' others are on the side of 'sign up for a few'.   I suppose there could also be a button 'uncheck all' but in either case, having some grouping makes sense so that people can focus on the sub-groups they are interesting in, e.g. FHIR, V2,  V3, etc.</p>
