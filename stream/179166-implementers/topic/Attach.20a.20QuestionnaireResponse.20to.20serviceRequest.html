<p>What is the best way to attach a questionnaireResponse to a serviceRequest?<br>
1) Reference the QuestionnaireResponse from ServiceRequest.SupportingInfo<br>
2) Reference the ServiceRequest from QuestionnaireResponse.basedOn<br>
3) Other?</p>
<p>Note: This is a questionnaire that is submitted with the request, not in response to the request (i.e., the serviceRequest is not being FULFILLED by this QuestionnaireResponse, it's being submitted). </p>
<p>I was considering QuestionnaireResponse.basedOn buy am having second thoughts based on the description which says "Request FULFILLED by this QuestionnaireResponse" ... which is not the scenario.</p>

<p>We're planning to talk about Questionnaire-related workflow as part of the <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/questionnaire/subject/SDC.20call" target="_blank" title="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/questionnaire/subject/SDC.20call">Structured Data Capture</a> project.</p>
<p>Where you attach sort of depends on why you're attaching.  If it's information to take into account or that is expected to help when executing the request, <code>supportingInfo</code> is appropriate.  <code>basedOn</code> is really intended to point to "request" resources - so plans, proposals or higher level orders that help to provide justification/authorization for this particular ServiceRequest.  But it might be possible to have an extension pointing to it as a "reason" for the order or perhaps some other sort of link.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> , in this case Questionnaire is meant to capture a "Referral Form" used in a eReferral process flow. Let's say i'm referring to meals on wheels, and i want to know a) the patient's food preferences (puree, kosher, etc...), b) If there's a dangerous dog when delivering, c) etc...</p>
<p>i.e., to collect all of the miscellaneous info that gets asked in a referral for things other than your core data like demographics, location, etc...</p>
<p>So yes, it's "information to take into account that is expected to help when executing the request". So sounds like /supportingInfo is the right option then?</p>

<p>Yes.  Though be aware that information in a QuestionnaireResponse is more limited in terms of computable interoperability than discrete observations or something like that.  (Not saying QuestionnaireResponse is inappropriate for your use-case, just encouraging you to make sure you've thought about the tradeoffs.)</p>

<p>Ok interesting, when using observations in a serviceRequest, should the by referenced by serviceRequest.supportingInfo too?</p>

<p>If it's information included in the proposal/plan/order to aid in the execution of the requested event, yes.</p>

<p>Would the same logic apply to clinical/diagnostics/medications resources that might help inform to serviceRequest, such as  an /allergy, or /MedicationStatement, even though those resources exist referencing the same /patient that is referenced by the /serviceRequest?</p>
<p>e.g., reference an /allergy resource in serviceRequest.supporting info?</p>

<p>The way I think of it, "supportingInfo" is intended to provide links to those things the author of the request feels that the filler is likely to need to know/have access to when performing the requested activity (but that don't actually define the requested activity).  If you were going to send the request in a messaging or other loosely coupled environment, you'd include all the resources pointed to by "supportingInfo" as part of the message bundle.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think that the QuestionnaireResponse should be attached to the serviceRequest vie the supporting information property.</p>
