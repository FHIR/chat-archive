<p>Looking a bit at the CDA section 2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.10416. Is Guarantor conceptually equal to Coverage.policyHolder or Coverage.subscriber? I know that Account has Guarantor better defined, but if I'm just generating Coverages, where is the right place to put it?</p>

<p>It would seem:<br>
performer.assignedEntity.code = PAYOR is the payor<br>
performer.assignedEntity.code = GUAR means guarantor, which I think is Coverage.policyHolder<br>
participant.TypeCode = HLD means Coverage.subscriber<br>
participant.TypeCode = COV means covered party member, which means Coverage.beneficiary</p>

<p>Which is confusing if so, since HLD is so close to holder</p>

<p>Guarantor has to support an organization, so it has to be Coverage.policyHolder. I think you are seeing (and suffering) the evolution of the Guarantor concept from HL7 v2.x (GT1 segment) to HL7 V3 (and therefore CDA) to FHIR.</p>

<p>I don't think Guarantor can be Coverage.policyHolder.  You can have account guarantors for things that don't have Coverage.  I'm not really  familiar with CDA, but it seems odd to have guarantor in Coverage.</p>

<p>This CDA section is specifically listing coverages, so while guarantors are a superset (i.e. aren't always tied to a coverage), perhaps in this context, they always are the coverage policy holder?</p>
