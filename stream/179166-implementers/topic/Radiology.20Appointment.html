<p>ImagingStudy is more for interfacing with the PACS; I don't see a strong need in your use case. I'm sure you could model the modality as a device (especially if you are trying to track availability) but I haven't seen it done yet. </p>
<p>My guess is the relationship is best modelled with the Appointment basedOn a ServiceRequest, and a Procedure basedOn the same ServiceRequest. Most of the details of the exam will be captured in either the ServiceRequest or the resulting Procedure; the Appointment is more to block the time and resources for conducting the Procedure. At some point the images will be captured, and an ImagingStudy may be created that points back at the Procedure.</p>
