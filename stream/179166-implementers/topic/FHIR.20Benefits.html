<p>Hi,<br>
Can someone help me find a response to a question which may rarely be asked in the FHIR community yet questionable <br>
What is the benefit of using Rest FHIR vs Open API when it comes to exposing your systems features ? Please bear in mind, I’m designing a system in a well established staffing (workforce management) system where no one uses or familiar with FHIR yet servicing to health sector purely on staff management.</p>

<p>Hi Medi,</p>
<p>The key difference is that FHIR is a standard.</p>
<p>Publishing your own work via OpenAPI means that other people <em>can</em> use your API, if they implement it.  This limits interoperability to systems developing against your particular software.  Every connection to your system requires someone else to spend development time and money, specific to your system.</p>
<p>With a standard, the theory* is that any two implementing systems can exchange information.  So, you gain the benefit of an entire ecosystem of implementations to work with out of the box.</p>
<p>*Practically speaking, the standard isn't perfect and there are variations between implementations.  That said, those variations are minor in comparison to the difference in implementing a variety of custom protocols.</p>
<p>Does that help?</p>

Well, that doesn’t answer my concerns fully. Let me explain more. Imagine you and 100 other more software providers wanted to work interoperable. I’m saying FHIR and design a model so complex to deliver a concept with extensions and references and code systems and so on so force. While another architect gives us a nice structured open api definition in swagger. Why would anyone want to proceed with my model over something else which is not bound to FHIR limitations ? And please don’t tell me standard because people wanted to spend less and gain more respectfully. <br>
I can understand that you get so much benefit in clinical transaction world but not sure on staffing management world and even related financial transactions</p>

<p>I do not know the context so I cannot see where FHIR is a model so complex that requires extensions for your use case but that is conceivable.<br>
But for code systems, I guess the other architect must also use reference data, right?</p>

<p>Perhaps your scope is such that you are better off with a custom message, but what about </p>
<ul>
<li>data consistency/reuse (does your data mean the same across systems, so that you can do e.g. reporting)?</li>
<li>system evolution (will you change your custom interface every time you have a new system)?</li>
<li>scope expansion (are you sure you will not add anything to the scope, e.g. privacy matters, changing workflows, more coded data...)?</li>

<p>No, what I mean is since FHIR Rest API can be exposed (with some manual work, I guess) as OpenAPI, the situation does not seem that you have "only" FHIR, and the other architect has openAPI. You can have openApi as well.<br>
The debate between those architects is <br>
#1 has a FHIR content definition, that is universal, has some infrastructure for deploying, testing, etc etc.. and can be exposed with OpenAPI.<br>
#2 has a custom structure and can be exposed in openApi perhaps faster, because you don't have to think of standard data, versioned interfaces, test support, community, maintainability... (do I make a point yet?). </p>
<p>That is what I believe is the comparison. not FHIR vs OpenAPI.</p>

<p>Oh yes, yes. <br>

<p>You don't have to bend the FHIR resources. If they do not mean what you want, you can make custom resources. Not ideal, but could work.</p>

<p>The short answer is that FHIR is targeted to healthcare- specific usecases, not generic cross-industry use cases.  FHIR isn't designed to support Human Resources, Facility Management, Inventory Management, etc.  Those areas are not our target scope.  In some cases there can be overlap and if you're already doing FHIR for everything else, with creative use of the resources and possibly supplementing with Basic (or custom resources, depending on how much of the shared infrastructure you want to use), you can make it work.</p>

<p>It's sounding to me that your system is targeting more generic HR functions than healthcare -specific functions. If so, you might not find FHIR a great fit.  Whether FHIR is an "acceptable" fit will depend in part on whether the systems involved will also need FHIR for other purposes.</p>

The good thing about FHIR is the governance around it. Would custom resource + openapi would be an option ? If we use custom resource we’d able to use the FHIR governance around it. Forge and Simplifier supports this but not sure about Vonk if we wanted to benefit the tooling. Having read the other threads I still don’t know if there is a tool which can convert structure definition or a profile to swagger.</p>

<p>Most tools support 'custom resources' - as does Vonk. There are two ways of supporting custom resources: the official FHIR way, which is using a Basic resource with extensions. Or the non-FHIR way which is to define your own resources. The latter allows you to do things in a FHIR-like manner, whilst officially it won't be FHIR compliant.</p>

<p>A custom resource won't have much governance from HL7 unless the intention is to define a profile on Basic and bring that through the HL7 balloting process.  If you create a truly custom resource (one not part of HL7's official list), then that option isn't really available to you.  (While you may be able to get it to work with certain tooling stacks, you won't be able to make it work with all, and you'll lose out on certain infrastructure like the public test servers.)</p>
<p>The other option is to make a case that your use-case should become an official part of the FHIR scope because the healthcare-specific requirements mean that industry-independent solutions can't work.</p>

<p>Thanks you both <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191372">@René Spronk</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> . I believe if I wanted to go down to the root of Custom resource my only option would be the latter solution suggested by Rene, as maintaining a big bundle with extension is outrageous. <br>
On a different but related note, do you have experiences of a hybrid solution like defining the concept which can be implemented using the current resources and the one doesn’t using a custom resource. <br>
Also can you suggest how to make a case against creating a custom resource for workforce management. I’d be happy to share my insights</p>

<p>There's nothing that stops you from defining additional RESTful capabilities that aren't FHIR.  And code can certainly mix and match what data it's passing around.  The challenge is that much of the off-the-shelf FHIR software won't work with the custom/non-FHIR resources without tweaking.</p>
<p>In terms of making the case, it's really a matter of explaining how/why resource management is different in the healthcare space than it is say in the financial industry or manufacturing industry.</p>

<p>Right.  But in healthcare, there are all sorts of business functions (payroll, purchasing, etc.) that aren't healthcare-specific.  We don't try to make FHIR do those things.  Is there something intrinsically different about managing doctors and nurses that wouldn't apply to managing salespeople or lawyers?  HL7 doesn't have the expertise (or bandwidth) to try to cover requirements that aren't healthcare-specific.</p>

<p>Hard to say on the fly but I’d say it is more healthcare specific than other industries. Ex. Managing specialist or nurses in a hospital is so different than managing staff in a car industry. Also qualification and specialities are healthcare related. So I’d say it is very specific and even more specific in the uk distinctively</p>

<p>Yup, what Lloyd said.<br>
What are the areas in there you're trying to cover?<br>
We already cover people, places, qualifications, locations, services and organizations (and the relationships between them)<br>
And also appointments and schedules, but not recurrences (without describing each one)<br>
A shift could be modelled using a slot, but is a small adjustment, and not really designed for shuffling things about.<br>
The slot was more intended to cover availability, which a shift kind of is. Alternately a schedule could narrow down to a shift too. (and have lots of those)</p>

<p>In some cases this may or not be possible, but <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="203885">@Medi Harsini</span> this is one thing that I see as a huge advantage in FHIR (and standard-based approaches): <br>
in FHIR we have information models, such that we can check whether a concept can be reused or not, or can be adapted/translated to another model or industry. And if we do adapt/translate, the whole platform supports it because the standard relies on other standards.<br>
If you do a single-purpose solution, every expansion may prove to be a challenge. But your other architect must know that and have experience with scope creeps.</p>

<p>This is an interesting thread. My understanding is that putting something into a FHIR format does not guarantee interoperability. To truly be interoperable you need to create resources and interactions that are consistent with an Implementation Guide. The IG will inform meaningful interactions in a way that unconstrained resource definitions will be unable to do. Using <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191549">@Frank Oemig</span>'s  example, no other hotel system would be able to know that a Patient is actually a guest and admission is actually a hotel check-in without some agreed upon system for interactions/data quality.</p>

<p>Well, the  hotel example is a little bit extreme, but ok and works. Ok, both sides have to implement the same spec and agree  on it of course. <br>
FHIR is a framework that helps to achieve interoperability. But as Lloyd states, without implementation guides it will not work. But even with IGs you may end up without interoperability if remaining freedom leeds to different - and then imcompatible - interpretations. <br>
So, if you create instances according to one IG and everything is fine, it may end up with missing interoperability according to another IG. If you have to create resource instances obeying to different IGs, those must be compatible, otherwise ...<br>
This is the reason why I argue in favor of profile hierarchies.</p>
<p>Concerning information models, they are coming from a business domain and should reflect the needs and requirements. You can translate those into different technical representations, and also have different representations in FHIR.</p>

<p>Hi Edward, sorry for not replying sooner but the new version (2.78.5740.721) of Power BI Desktop includes a FHIR server connector for native access to FHIR servers.  Documentation can be found <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/connectors/fhir/fhir" target="_blank" title="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/connectors/fhir/fhir">here</a>.</p>
