<p>In trying to suss out the relationship between a DiagnosticReport and Observations, it's clear the DiagnosticReport will have 0 or more Observations associated with it.  The Observation data model makes no specific reference back to a specific DiagnosticReport, so what I can't be sure about is whether or not it is expected that an Observation may be included in _multiple_ DiagnosticReports, or if the set of Observations for any given DiagnosticReport is a completely separate set (even if the dates, et al, are the same)?</p>
<p>In the JSON schema, I noticed this bit under "Observation":</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>        &quot;contained&quot;: {
          &quot;description&quot;: &quot;These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.&quot;,
          &quot;items&quot;: {
            &quot;$ref&quot;: &quot;#/definitions/ResourceList&quot;
          },
</pre></div>


<p>...which implies that Observations included under a DiagnosticReport are, in fact, unique elements of that report and should only be referenced "through" the report -- but in the HTML documentation, there's a reference to the "last n Observations query" (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-operation-lastn.html" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-operation-lastn.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-operation-lastn.html</a>) which makes apparent that these records _can_ be referenced "independently".</p>
<p>Can an Observation be referenced by multiple different DiagnosticReports or does each belong to only one report?</p>

<p>you're right to be unsure. THe specification does not prohibit a given observation being referenced from more than one report. That's deliberate. In general, though, it would be unusual for a source system to do that - typically, the diagnostic report owns the observations - they are part of it's life cycle. Though you might get more than one version of the same diagnostic report referencing the same observation, if it doesn't change</p>

<p>There are no rules prohibiting the same Observation from being referenced in multiple DiagnosticReports, though that would not be common.</p>
<p>The 'contained' element is only used for resources that cannot stand independently and are generally not accessed independently.  The intention with a DiagnosticReport is that all of the referenced Observations exist as independent instances, not sent as 'contained' resources.</p>

<p>Cool, cool.  Would it be expected, though, that an Observation referenced in a DiagnosticReport would, though, be also referenced by the other types, such as "Appointment", "ServiceRequest", etc?</p>
