<p>Is there work group oversees radiation oncology? I'm trying to figure out how to represent something like a Brachytherapy treatment. It's not a procedure (per definition on the wiki a procedure does not include radiation therapy since it is dosed), but ImagingStudy doesn't seem to fit, either. (Nor does MedicationAdminstration, really.) </p>

<p>Record of treatment, though a protocol would be a great extension (in the generic sense of being better than just the individual treatments, not in the FHIR definition of extension)</p>

<p>so my take on this is that right now we have Procedure, but this is actually statement-of-past-procedure,  not record-of-procedure, and you want the second. It's one working concern I have with Procedure - badly described scope. I think that chemotherapy and radiation records should be scope for the second, but there's a gray line between them and complex medication protocols and normal medication administration</p>

<p>This includes surgical procedures, diagnostic procedures, endoscopic procedures, biopsies. It also includes group therapy, training, psycho-therapy, music therapy, etc. It does not include drug therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, light therapy or other therapies where "dosage" is a primary aspect of the intervention.</p>

<p>Radiation is a "known issue".  We could use Procedure, we could generalize MedicationAdministration or we could create a new resource.  We haven't had enough people at the table who could speak to it well for us to decide how to approach it.  If you can capture the "common" data elements most systems would support in this space, that would be helpful.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191433">@Terry McDonnell</span> Did you make some way with a proposal on the Branchytherapy treatment? I am trying to figure out how to represent radiation therapy-statement-of-past  procedures ( I think) for oncological registries. Looking through the FHIR documentation, we (I work on this with a medical physicist) also got stuck between Procedure and MedicationAdministration as potential, but not really appropriate base resources.</p>

<p>Searching by someone who received a bunch of resource instances and is unfamiliar with the use of <code>MedicationAction</code> for radiation therapy. If they assume radiation therapy is a type of procedure, is it still easy for them to find the radiation therapy information in profiles of <code>MedicationAction</code>?<br>
If some source systems template <code>MedicationAction</code> for radiation therapy and others template <code>Procedure</code>, processing them will be messy.</p>

<p>Hi, we are also working in RT and started looking into FHIR. Not sure how much time I can assign. As potential RT data on FHIR I would see RT Intent/Prescription (at a higher level, not the detailed level covered by DICOM 2nd gen RT), treatment progress reporting (currently covered by custom HL7 2.x implementations), but also Procedure(Requests) for delivery of single treatment fractions with some RT details (detailed plan and tx record data also here covered by DICOM).</p>

<p>The major trouble I'm having with it is that I can not extend ProcedureRequest with a Dosage field, as Dosage is not a valid extension value type. Is it better to use the Medication[X] resources for RT? I could fit everything in, including multiple bodysites, but it feels wrong.</p>

<p>I'm talking specifically about the procedure, Radiation therapy to chest wall 45 - 50.4 Gy in 25-28 fractions. By any modality like 3d conformal IMRT, EBRT or Electrons. Brachytherapy is another modality option for some sites, and that also has a dose. Modality can be fit in with an extension or the new order details codeable field, or right in the code field. But it's the dosage that I don't know where to fit.</p>

<p>Possibly, but this is something i would bring under "healthProduct" - it is one of those cases where it could be a new resource, or a specialization...</p>

<p>No, ServiceRequest would contain a request for a product (xxxRequest, where xxx is medication, healthProduct, and xxxRequest contains the dosage.</p>

<p>Jose, you're thinking about this from a modeling perspective.  We need to drive the requirements from an implementation perspective.  Where do existing systems typically mange orders for radio-therapy?  Are they in the same user interface and repository as they put their drug orders, in the same user interfaces as they put their orders for surgery, lab tests and physio therapy, or are they in a separate user interface/repository.  That'll be the primary guide for whether we should leverage one of the existing resources or create a new one.  The catalogue issue is a red herring.  Catalogues are all about definitions of things and that'll be at a completely different level than capturing the orders and the execution.</p>

<p>Looking a this from a resource management perspective - we have yet to been decide whether this use cases deserve a new resource or a new profile.  I am more inclined to start with profile on MedRequest or ServiceRequest.</p>

<p>Is that leaning based on the behavior of existing systems that support both radiation therapy and medication therapy or other forms of requests?  Whether it's a new resource or a profile on one of the existing resources is indeed the first question to answer - but I haven't yet heard much opinion from those who have such systems how they currently display and store data.  The opinions on what we should do seem to be coming primarily from modelers - and that's not who should drive the decision :)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> i did not want to bring the Catalog for this case, so perhaps the "healthProduct" thing was misleading - it is not the same as catalog. I was looking at some recent work where we had to align radiopharmaceuticals products with medicines from a perspective on "how to order the products" perspective. We did not have the "how to order the actual service". But from the little I remember, i think the dosage should not be on the service component of the request, but on the product ordering request, which i think makes more sense. (I have touched this a long time ago, where we had to handle the ordering, and our roadmap was to look at the decay between preparation and administration, handling supply issues and radiation exposure..). Yep, i think i am modeling :)</p>

<p>For radiotherapy, I don't think we're talking about radiopharmaceuticals - those would almost certainly be handled using the Medication-related resources (though we might need some extensions to properly capture the notion of "strength").  My understanding of what's being asked for with respect to radiotherapy is the ability to order and record directed radiation treatments.  With those there's no "injection/injestion", just a beam of a particular size, type, direction, intensity, duration, etc.  There is a "dose", but it's not of an active ingredient.</p>

<p>For the radiotherapy prescription/intent I would also say they need the same information: sites/targets, dose objectives to targets, dose constraints to organs at risk, how the dose is fractionated, and treatment modes/techniques as far as the physician or the protocol wants to detail the technical aspects. There the modes/techniques would say brachy or photons/protons/electrons. When it comes to exact technical details to fulfill the prescription the differences get bigger, such as dwell times for brachy or beam angles and monitor units for external beams. But those details that are worked out within the RT department, I would not expect that we map those to FHIR. This is well served by DICOM and I would expect DICOM references in requests or procedures for the technical plan details. Also prescription in the very detail is taken care of by DICOM RT 2nd gen. But for prescription and how far the treatment  has progressed there is certainly a need to have a more light-weight representation on FHIR for interoperability with outside the RT domain, with systems that can't get into DICOM.</p>

<p>I would like to renew this thread if anyone is interested.  I am approaching this much more from the clinical side than from a true implementer role, so please forgive any displays of ignorance.<br>
I have been working with several organizations (IHE-RO, Amer. Soc. Ther. Radiation Oncology) who are all interested in more explicit representation of radiation therapy in electronic health records.  To this end, some recommended standards are being worked on.  There are many different aspects to this, and I was interested in Martin's very thorough response.   As he points out, there are some basic elements of RT that need to be communicated and don't seem to fit any paradigms that I have seen discussed.<br>
Current ASTRO recommendations for the Prescription (most basic of all sets of information for EHR) include:<br>
body site (codeable), method of delivery (codeable but not with current int'l standards), dose per fraction (including units), number of fractions, and total dose (with units).<br>
From my admittedly suboptimal review of the resources, these elements could be included in ProcedureRequest and List resources.  This does not seem ideal to me, but nothing else does either. I would appreciate any thoughts and insights.</p>

<p>Elliot: Thanks for the head's up.  I will contact them--perhaps they have already worked some of this out.<br>
Kevin,<br>
PlanDefinition, like ProcedureRequest, has some good aspects.  However, the issue of dose and how to specify it looks to be somewhat difficult.   Dose has been discussed earlier in this thread with little resolution.  For the 5 different prescription elements,  are you thinking of the dynamicValue element?  <br>
In looking at the PlanDefinition details, I went back to look at CarePlan resource, which I had originally thought of as encompassing the larger RT effort (not just one target).  It has a lot of flexibility which is good (action element plus detail element). <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191380">@Elliot Silver</span>  The description also indicates that radiation therapy is an acceptable use.</p>

<p>Mark, we haven't had a chance to discuss RT in II/WG-20 yet, but it is certainly something that crosses into our interest zone.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196344">@Mark Phillips</span> The current proposal for a chemotherapy regimen is here... <a href="https://simplifier.net/nccnchemotherapyorde/ordertemplate" target="_blank" title="https://simplifier.net/nccnchemotherapyorde/ordertemplate">https://simplifier.net/nccnchemotherapyorde/ordertemplate</a>  .  It looks like they have several <code>contained</code> objects that are profiled versions of <code>ActivityDefinition</code> that have dosages in them.  I will also point out that I don't know very much about how RT is dosed, so I'm also not sure how useful this will be to you.</p>

<p>+1.  Add me to the list of people interested in how best to represent Radiation therapy.  I was indirectly involved in the nccn chemotherapy order template and we only scoped to medications.   Attribute-wise, this straddles somewhere between a procedure request and a medication request, with neither satisfying the representation of radiation dose.  I think we're in new territory here.  cc: <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191447">@Mark Kramer</span></p>

<p>I could see this as MedicationRequest and MedicationAdministration with the dosageInstruction holding the plan.  It has the basic structure needed, although I think a mapping exercise would be needed for this before I would be certain.</p>
