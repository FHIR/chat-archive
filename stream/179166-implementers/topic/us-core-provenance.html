<p>for each target which we must send Provenance for, <br>
can we send different types of "agents" in each resource? for example: for Medication Request I'll send the Author, but for Procedure I'll send the Performer?</p>
<p>and another Q-<br>
recorded-<br>
does that mean the time when for example the lab result was recorded in the medical record? or the when problem was originally documented in the EHR?</p>

<p>The basic provenance is just that... basic. If you have more details about the provenance and provide it that is fine.</p>

<p>I thought "recorded" is one per Provenance resource, not one per agent</p>

<p>Yes, Each Provenance has 1 recorded. But if you have an actor prov + a transmitter prov + an assembler prov. Then there is a recorded for the actor and a recorded for the transmitter and a recorded for the assembler. (when each actor acted upon the target).</p>
