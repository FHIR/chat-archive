<p>We have had similar requests in the past to add a permit number on a MedicationRequest - which includes the authorization a prescriber has to prescribe a certain drug or type of drugs.  Is this what you are looking for?  The ability for a prescriber to include his/her authorization or permit when prescribing?  If so, I think you should add a tracker item so pharmacy can re-consider.  If it is a way to request authorization (as in the application), I don't think we have anything like this.</p>

<p>From the requirements we are seeing the permit should be an entity that is related to either a patient or a practitoner rather then an instance of a MedicationRequest. The permit itself will have workflow in the system where by a regulator can activate the permit</p>

<p>In our pre-FHIR model, <code>practitioners</code> has a data group called <code>Entitlements</code>(The entitlement or right of a participant to act in a given capacity (as defined by Entitlement Type) within a healthcare context.) with attributes identifier, type and period-of-validity. It is what we would have used. <br>
There does not seem to be a suitable place for this in FHIR.</p>

<p>In the US, we call this the DEA number ( as in:  DEA number (DEA Registration Number) is a number assigned to a health care provider (such as a medical practitioner, optometrist, pharmacist, dentist, or veterinarian) by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration allowing them to write prescriptions for controlled substances.).  I agree this number is  associated with the prescriber, not the Medication Request itself.  When the Medication Request is the source for a formal prescription, it is often expected to include the DEA number for the prescriber in the order.  Since we Reference the Practitioner as an author of the prescription.  I had expected that Practitioner would have a place for the DEA number - maybe via the Qualification structure, or something like that structure.</p>

<p>Wouldn't you also need to have the ordering provider name and phone number or address on the request?  I suspect it would still be handled through a Practitioner reference in FHIR.</p>

<p>I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191759">@Melva Peters</span> : please add your requirements as a tracker item. </p>
<p>In the US, generally, a medication order must indicate the prescriber, address, phone, and license or DEA (DEA required if the medication is a "controlled substance").  These are generally considered characteristics of the prescriber, i.e.,  they are always the same for that prescriber (sometimes location specific).  </p>
<p>That's the simple case.  There can be additional requirements.  There are a few products where a specific (federal) authorization is required (not recalling if it is specific to the prescriber, patient, or both).  There are also REMS (risk management programs) where each prescription must tie back to documentation that the prescriber, patient, and sometimes pharmacist have received specific education and enrollment in the program.</p>
<p>One could argue that the "additional requirements" are not in the 80%.  However, the FDA has proposed that ALL opioid prescriptions be covered in  REMS program ... that will certainly will fall into the 80%</p>

<p>Our requirements are quite solution specific with little detail around the business scenarios they are trying to accomodate - we are pressing for more information.

<p>Yes, you wouldn't use Coverage as that provides insurance/assurance program identifiers.<br>
Typically providers have an identifier for each category of service they are permitted (scope of practice) to perform and usually must list which on is applicable in a given data exchange.<br>
A license is typically an annual reaffirmation of the right to practice that scope, as issued by a registrar - given that HL7 has not generally been used in provider licensing systems we don't have a content model, in FHIR (CDA, V3 or V2) to my knowledge which captures the license details.<br>
Usually we capture that a person is licenced as a ZZZZZ by registrar AAAAA for period BBBBB but don't record the specific instance of a licence.</p>

<p>We should cover different levels: Besides per practitioner or institution, the permit may also be workflow instance.  <br>
In some countries, for some kinds of requests, a unique number is issued per request. This means "once this prescription has this unique number, then it can be dispensed".</p>
