<p>Hi-  Where can we incorporate justification reason for a CDS hooks response, as this list of Fhir resources triggered this action of a CDSCard? I don't see any such placeholder or provision in the CDSHooks response model. Can we use GuidanceResponse for this, as it has provision to capture 'reason' and 'reason reference'? CDSHooks structure for a request and response as GuidanceResponse.</p>

<p>GuidanceResponse maps more to the overall response, so we've typically seen it used as a way to persist the response from a CDS Hooks service, rather than returned as part of a CDS Hooks response. For justification in general, you're right, there's not really a slot in the CDS Hooks response for that. However, we've typically associated that information more with the specific resources, so your response might be "recommendation to order a medication", and that would be represented as a MedicationRequest, and that would have the reason and reason reference associated with it.</p>

<p>In what we're balloting this cycle, we've defined these types of profiles for the various types of recommendations that will come back from decision support, here's the MedicationRequest profile, for example: <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-recommendations/StructureDefinition-cpg-medicationrequest.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-recommendations/StructureDefinition-cpg-medicationrequest.html">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-recommendations/StructureDefinition-cpg-medicationrequest.html</a></p>

<p>And we say that systems must support the reasonCode and reasonReference attributes, specifically to ensure that type of information can be returned with the result.</p>

<p>We also use the cqf-strengthOfRecommendation and cqf-qualityOfEvidence extensions to indicate how well-supported the recommendation is.</p>

<p>Thanks for your response. Can you please point to an example of MedicationRequest or like profile(s) where reasonCode and reasonReference are used?</p>

<p>Actually, we are trying to implement in a way that we want to provide reason/justification criteria/resources for publishing a particular alert i.e CDSHooks Card. A 'recommendation order' is an action item but we want to tell the reason in the form of list of Fhir Clinical resources ( reason/justification criteria)/Condition/Procedure/Encounter etc.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the information in the cards being passed back in a hook response are intended to be seen by a clinican.  Typically you want to provide only 'essential' information, as every word takes time and represents an interference in workflow.  So make sure that the clinicians/users really want the information you're passing back.  (It may be better to provide a link to a separate website titled "justification" or "rationale" that can be clicked on if/when providers actually care.)</p>
