<p>What is the risk of using resource immunizationEvaluation at FMM '0' ?  I notice some of the data elements are branched off from resource immunization of R3.</p>

<p>I did not know we had a resource ImmunizationEvaluation, and I do not know what it is supposed to convey. Is it a snapshot of the vaccination plan + current administered vaccines? If so, isn't this a bit more complicated than having the vaccination plan and the snapshot of administrations separately? I think it is hard to maintain the lifecycle of a resource that contains a protocol and the realisation of an instanciation of that protocol.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196916">@Maria Hu</span> Draft resources haven't yet been approved as "ready for production use".  That doesn't mean you can't use them, but it does mean you're more likely to run into issues.  Also, the risk of the resource being significantly refactored or even going away is higher.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> It represents the evaluation about whether a particular immunization "counts" (based on timing and the protocol of a particular jurisdiction).  Essentially the same immunization could be evaluated differently in different places.  One might think you're fully immunized.  Another might think that you need a booster or even that you're not immunized at all.</p>

<p>i understand. it informs of a series of immunizations (which is ok)<br>
but it seems to convey the protocol itself, and that is where i had a question. Here's an example: My vaccination history is clear, but whether it is timely or not depends on the country I am in.. so it seems less clean to put the protocol in the resource and not in a reference, even if the way vaccines are usually presented is exactly with protocol + administrations in one paper.</p>

<p>The evaluation is tied to a single protocol.  If you have multiple countries, each will have a distinct evaluation instance.  (And you might even get multiple evaluation instances within the same country/jurisdiction if they change protocols.)</p>

<p>Thanks Lloyd for the clarification.</p>

<p>There may also be multiple active sets of recommendations within a jurisdiction. For example, measles/mumps/rubella is recommended (in the US) at ages 12 months and 4 years and any dose before 12 months is considered invalid. However, if an infant (6 to 12 months) is travelling internationally, there is a recommendation for a dose of MMR prior to travel. However, this dose still doesn't count towards the standard recommendations, so a dose at 11 months is simultaneously  both valid (for the travel recommendation) and invalid (for the standard recommendation).</p>
