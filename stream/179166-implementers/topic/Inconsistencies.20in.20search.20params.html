<p>Hi all, some search params (such as those on Patient <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/patient.html#search" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/patient.html#search">http://hl7.org/fhir/patient.html#search</a>) have inconsistent formats (birthdate vs death-date). There's also typos in some of the descriptions. Is there any active discussion/work around this? If so could someone point me toward it?</p>

<p>The way to report typos would be to open an issue at <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/projects/FHIR/issues" target="_blank" title="https://jira.hl7.org/projects/FHIR/issues">https://jira.hl7.org/projects/FHIR/issues</a> In my opinion inconsistencies are not an issue - but you can open an issue for that as well if you think they are (but I sure hope the spec won't change due to that).</p>

<p>we have a standard but some are not being fixed because of legacy reasons</p>
