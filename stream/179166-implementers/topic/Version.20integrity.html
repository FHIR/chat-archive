<p>Dear,<br>
In the comments of the meta.versionId field it is stated that "The server assigns this value, and ignores what the client specifies, except in the case that the server is imposing version integrity on updates/deletes."</p>
<p>When a server implements version integrity,  does it have to impose it for every resource profile? Or is it possible to impose it on some profiles, but not on others? What would be the preferred place to document this behaviour for our server: in the profiles, capability statement, implementation guide, ...?</p>

<p>Version integrity would have to be enforced on a resource by resource basis.  What it means is that an external system has control not only over your 'primary keys' but your internal versioning mechanism.  Every time you update a resource, the version changes - that's true regardless of what profile it's valid against, and it's possible the prior version is valid against a profile and the new version is not or vice versa.  If you're allowing an external system to control that, that's an internal design consideration and is going to be independent of what profiles or IGs you're compliant with.</p>
