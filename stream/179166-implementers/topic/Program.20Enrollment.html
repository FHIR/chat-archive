<p>Has there been any discussion/modelling been done around managing program enrollment information in FHIR? A profile on Eligibility or Account comes to mind. This may be peculiar to US realm, but maybe not. </p>

<p>Not sure if this could map into EpisodeOfCare?<br>
Here in Australia an organization is required to have an active/approved EpisodeOfCare for many govt programs that funding is allocated to, and from there an account is allocated to the EoC and funding runs through that.<br>
(I don't how that works in the US though)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191367">@Brian Postlethwaite</span> Yes, related to EpisodeOfCare and/or CarePlan. My initial take on this would be that Program would be a profile on Account to identify the program and the terms of participation. Created once a patient, for example, agreed to participate in a study or government program. But I haven't gotten too deep into this yet. Thanks for the response.</p>

<p>No problems, the contract could hold the details of theofficial agreement, and then the EoC as the container, and the CarePlan to fo the planning with. All makes sense there.</p>

<p>Or a profile on Enrollment when that gets flushed out.</p>

<p>Enrollment sounds like a business process similar to admission.  Patients both join and leave programs.  We don't have a resource for "admission", just admission and discharge information on Encounter.  My leaning would be for us to follow a similar pattern for program participation.</p>

<p>In NZ, enrollment in the Health &amp; Disability Sector is principally used in relation to funding-related programmes and is predicated on the distinct, but related, concepts of eligibility and entitlement. For example, eligible patients, who also meet the entitlement criteria, have to enroll with a single general practice in order to receive subsidized treatment.</p>

<p>Enrollment is also used to manage participation in clinical trials and also has an eligibility checking phase, though there generally isn't an entitlement aspect.  (In the end, I think you can treat entitlement as just another aspect of eligibility.)</p>

<p>Agreed - eligibility and entitlement, in this context, are just different types of qualification criteria. During the NZ National Enrolment System project we landed on eligibility as a precursor to entitlement but I, for one, never found the distinction all that helpful - just indicative of the fact that law is all about making fine, and often artificial, distinctions.</p>
