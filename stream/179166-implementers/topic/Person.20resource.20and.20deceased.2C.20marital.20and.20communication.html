<p>About the Person resource</p>
<p>I was planning to add a tracker issue for addition of Person.deceased, Person.maritalStatus and Person.communication. As it turns out two of these proposition has been raised before by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191375">@Alexander Henket</span> . Both deceased and maritalStatus change to the Person resource is refused by the workgroup on the basis: "The Person resource is not intended to be the demographic store for all patients/people.<br>
Its core usage is for the very basics and linkages."</p>
<p>I think this explanation misses something vital in the description of the Person resource, its intended purpose and it's actual use. The description of the resource states plainly: "Demographics and administrative information about a person independent of a specific health-related context."</p>
<p>The first two use-cases mentioned:<br>
"A set of demographics that can be used to co-ordinate the maintenance of this de-normalized information across practitioners, patients and/or related persons<br>
e.g. link known resources of the different types together within a system<br>
A state/network based Master Person Index"</p>
<p>This is the exact opposite of the reasoning for rejecting these changes, I think this is a mistake that will cripple the standard for these central use-cases. The master Person Index is a central part of the healtcare sector in most countries.</p>
<p>Is there a way to reopen the issues in GForge, or should I add my own change requests?</p>

<p>I still stand by my issues and thus agree with you. You die as a Person, not in your role as Patient or Practitioner. Same goes for marriage. FHIR currently does not let you die or marry as a Person. That's awkward at best. In some respects V3 had this figured out better. </p>
<p>As for your questions on how to re-raise the issue: I'd recommend opening a new ticket with a pointer to the old one.</p>
<p>Note that Person came late to the game in FHIR because the consensus was that in the 80% of implementations  there's no Person registry. Only Patient and Practitioner. The same reasoning is behind why there is no link between RelatedPerson and Patient.contact</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, that's not really how the data in FHIR was modelled.  We don't strictly model the properties of an entity in the real word onto the equivalent entity in the model, we model the data to match the process around it.   E.g. you have a diet as a Person, yet, the diet element is placed on Encounter.  Why?  Because we figured the dietary preferences are registered as part of the admission.  That's why Person is not a person, but the <em>demographic information around a Person</em>. And similarly, a Patient is not a patient in the real world, but the data we register in the process around Patient. It's a record, not the patient itself.</p>

<p>The patient may die, but the administrative record of that would likely end up on the Person record (if you have one), while the clinical circumstances may live in Patient context. Assuming you have both a Patient and a Person registry, my guess is that the master file is Person for death recording and the Patient record would need to be in sync with that</p>

<p>Most patient records have a death property (in the systems I've worked with).  Everything is registered against the patient MRN/eMPI, so yes, you would check the patient record to see if they're dead.</p>

<p>If you don't have a Person registry, all bets are off, but if you do, you really want an essential property like Death there. Sure you'll delist Practitioner once his death as a patient becomes known. It's unlikely that you would delist his Person record.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That is one af the key questions here. Does it end up in a standard extension or as a integrated part of the Person resource. I believe death, communication and maritalStatus is well inside the 80% and that this should be included as part of the standard, as this is key information in every Master Person (or Patient) index. Other properties like when they arrived to the Kingdom (for imigrants), if they are listed as eligible to wote in Sami elections (actually a thing here in Norway) or known fake identities is clearly outside the 80% and absolutely should be solved by extensions.</p>
<p>I you are specially interested and know the Norwegian language you can se the model for the Norwegian master Person Index here:<br>

<p>We are now in the process of representing the data for use in the Norwegian healthcare sector and want to expose it to the sector using a FHIR RESTFul API.</p>

<p>Yes, we did in fact make an extension for deceased, its simple only contains the deceased date, except for the fregMetadata (that is data from the Norwegian Master Person Index from IRS-Norway). So the metadata part should not be included in the official extension. <br>
