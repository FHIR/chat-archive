<p>Both ResearchStudy and ResearchSubject have a need to track the lifecycle of the study / subject.  Status has been used for this in the past but is inadequate since we need date and sometimes reasons.  ResearchSubject now has a backbone element called progress and we could (sort of) replicate this for ResearchStudy.  But is this the best way of managing this issue?  Does another resource already have a solution to the same problem?   Is there a different tree we should be barking at?</p>

<p>Date and reason for status reasons for most resources is captured using 'relevantHistory' and Provenance - did BR&amp;R consider that approach?</p>

<p>That allows you to capture when certain events happened, why, who triggered them, etc.</p>
