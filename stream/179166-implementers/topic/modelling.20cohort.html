<p>I have a need to model cohort - for example a section of a population that are between certain ages, that have certain Conditions, and maybe live in a certain locality. So a query as outlined above could be run, and a cohort established. The result could be modelled as a List of patients, or a Group of Patients. Which would be the most appropriate? I'm leaning towards Group, as there are many associations set up for Groups within the FHIR model,  but List also offers a mechanism to have a List type (cohort type), and members (as entries).</p>

<p>Group lets you define the criteria - and allows the cohort to exist even if you haven't enumerated the members.  List doesn't allow for that.  Also, Group can be the target of certain actions (e.g. be a subject of a procedure, Observation, etc.) while List can't.</p>
