<p>In FHIR I search for all healthcareservice in a specific organization, I do:<br>
GET baseurl/healthcareservice?_organization=123</p>
<p>However, is it ok for me to build an API using a modern path based approach such as the following, or is it strongly discouraged?<br>
GET baseurl/organization/123/healthcareservice</p>

<p>More specifically, I'm trying to GET all appointments in a specific calendar in our application, but i can't find a concept of calendar ("Schedule" resource) as it exists for Appointment, as "Schedule" is intended only for open Slots</p>
<p>Where my local restful path to get all appointments in a calendar is:<br>
My native API: GET baseurl/calendar/123/appointment</p>
<p>I can't figure out the equivalent way to get all appointments in a calendar in FHIR as there's not query parameter for a schedule or calendar in the appointment resource<br>
FHIR: GET baseurl/Appointment/?_??????</p>
<p>Some options i'm considering right now:<br>
1) create a custom search parameter called ?_calendar<br>
2) when GETting fhir appointments by calendar, say that the base url = <a href="http://api.base.com/calendar/123/">api.base.com/calendar/123/</a></p>
<p>Does option 2 make sense in a FHIR world or is that discouraged?</p>

<p>the compartments supported will be dependent on the server capabilities</p>

<p>If i'm reading this correctly, it means that there's only compartments for 5 resources, so I COULDN'T do things like</p>
<p>/Organization/123/HealthcareService<br>
/Schedule/873/Slot</p>
<p>and that it's would be very unwise to do this for our implementation b/c these have to be approved at the HL7 international level, which is a big deal?</p>

<p>What is the best way to GET appointments by calendar? </p>
<p>e.g., a vaccination clinic has a calendar for 6 different rooms, all managed within one system, and I want to get the list of appointments for only Room A?</p>
<p>The two options I've come up with so far are:<br>
1) conceptualize the "calendar" as a "location"<br>
2) create a custom search parameter for my implementation ?_calendar=123</p>

<p>Compartments haven't been widely implemented.  They're a stylistic convention, but don't really add value.  They also presume that data exists in a hierarchy, and in some cases it doesn't.  <br>
Each 'resource' (person, location, significant piece of equipment) can have a 'Schedule' (i.e. a calendar).  So if you want a calendar for a room, you'd be looking for the Schedule associated with that Location.</p>

<p>And yes, it does very much depend on what is considered a calendar in the system you're talking to.<br>
The calendar is typically a Schedule resource, which has slots, and those can have appointments attached to them.<br>
Alternately you can search just based on your specific resource of interest via the Appointment?participant=resource/id</p>
