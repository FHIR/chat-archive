<p>If a third party were to send me a ServiceRequest to process some data and send them back a DiagnosticReport at a later date, what is the best  response for me to send back?  Would i have them just send me a callbackUrl in ServiceRequest.orderDetail? would I send them back a Subscription Resource? Other ideas for best practice?</p>
