<p>With support from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC), HL7® International is conducting an important survey among health IT developers and implementers to benchmark HL7® FHIR® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) usage, estimate its adoption rate and identify barriers to adoption. <br>
1.  If you have technical knowledge of standards related to APIs, please share your input by completing the survey. <br>
2.  Also, please forward this email with the survey link to your customers.<br>
We’re seeking one completed survey from each vendor/vendor product and one from each customers/provider site.<br>
Your individual responses will remain confidential as survey results will only be reported in the aggregate. The survey should take 18 minutes or less. Questions may be directed to the HL7 US Realm Program Manager, Gay Dolin at <a href="mailto:gdolin@hl7.org">gdolin@hl7.org</a>.<br>
Your input is very important to improving healthcare interoperability. The first 300 respondents who complete the survey will be entered into a drawing to win one of three $250 Visa gift cards. Please complete the survey today and share with your customers.</p>
