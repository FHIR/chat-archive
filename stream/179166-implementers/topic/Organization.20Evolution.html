<p>What sort of thinking has Patient Administration done about tracking the "evolution" of Organizations as they are merged, split, subsumed, etc?  Is there an intention to add a similar structure to what's on Patient?  Do we use Linkage?  Some other solution?</p>

<p>We have discussed this, and no, we do not plan on creating the joy that is merge on Orgs.<br>
These are typically setup as new Organization records, and alias values for the old names, then move all the other appropriate resources about, and mark the old ones as inactive.</p>

<p>Its what was done practically by the several vendors at the table, and don't think  there's really much more that can be done here.<br>
It's very different to a patient merge, in these instances much of the time they are new orgs that are created as a result of the merge, or becomes a dept. But also have lots of new identifiers and tax statuses etc that occur.</p>
