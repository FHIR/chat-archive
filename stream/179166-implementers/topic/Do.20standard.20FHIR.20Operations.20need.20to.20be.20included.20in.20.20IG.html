<p>Hi,  we have almost wrapped up adding /Patient/$everything to our API.  My question is Should we add Patient/$everything to our DPC IG, given that Patient/$everything is a standard FHIR operation?</p>

<p>Well , our server is the only server complying with the DPC IG for now.  Does the compliance requirement extend to clients?</p>

<p>also, in our capabilities stmt, do we define the /Patient/$everything operation with the FHIR URL or our IG URL?</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>&quot;operation&quot;: [

<p>The OperationDefinition doesn't need to appear in your IG if you're not constraining it.  However, it should be referenced in the CapabilityStatement(s) of the systems that need to support it.</p>

<p>All IGs have access to all resources, value sets, operations, etc. in the core spec, so they don't need to (and shouldn't) duplicate their definitions within their own IG.  (In fact, they can't because if you include a core artifact in your IG, you end up having to change the canonical URLs.)</p>

<p>That was my thought <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> .  Why would you duplicate a core operation in an IG, unless you were further constraining the core standard?  So we won't include it in the IG, but yes, it will be in the Capabilities stmt, with the url pointing back to the HL7 operation definition reference uri.</p>

<p>In the case of DPC, Patient/$everything requests must include a Provenance resource in an X-Provenance header for attestation. Would that be considered constraining the operation, as mentioned in <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> 's message, requiring DPC to have its own operation definition?</p>

<p>You have the ability to use CapabilityStatement.rest.operation.documentation to provide some general expectations.  Given that your requirement isn't computably expressible in OperationDefinition, there isn't really a benefit to creating a 'derived' OperationDefinition just to include that bit of information <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197736">@Emily Hart</span></p>
