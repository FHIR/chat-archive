<p>In Dialysis Treatment, Vascular access is one of the vital procedures.</p>
<p>Overview on vascular access: <br>
Before beginning hemodialysis treatment, a person needs an access to their bloodstream, called a vascular access. The access allows the patient’s blood to travel to and from the dialysis machine at a large volume and high speed so that toxins, waste and extra fluid can be removed from the body.</p>
<p>In reality, creating an access to a patient involves multiple procedures (like access cannulation, fistulagram, infiltration etc) performed during different time periods, therefore we cannot map an Access to a single Procedure FHIR resource. Typically more than one Procedures performed can be related to single Vascular Access.</p>
<p>In our existing non-fhir model, we have maintained VascularAccess as a separate domain entity (or Resource) which essentially contains but is not limited to,<br>
1. Access type - AV Fistula (Arteriovenous Fistula) / AV Graft / Catheter<br>
2. Access sub type - Bovine / Standard / Double Cuff / Tunneled<br>
2. Body site (whereWasAccessPlaced) - Above Elbow / below Elbow / Right Lower Quadrant<br>
3. Access status -- Active / Maturing / Removed / Permanently unusable</p>
<p>We are trying to find an appropriate FHIR resource for mapping Access,</p>
<p>Here is our open question?</p>
<p>1. Can we consider a Vascular Access as a Device or DeviceComponent?<br>
    below are the various access types,</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>AV Fistula - its a method of connection between an artery and a vein which doesn&#39;t involve any DeviceComponent but blood vessels.
AV Graft - A graft is tube (Device) that is inserted to connect an artery to a vein.
Cathether - it could be a Device component.
</pre></div>


<p>We would ideally need a Resource which would map the access type with a BodySite(location) and with an operational status.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Vijay</p>
