<p>Hello, I am a FHIR researcher from Korea.<br>
I just saw the ppt <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DevDays/fhir-search-for-clients-mirjam" target="_blank" title="https://www.slideshare.net/DevDays/fhir-search-for-clients-mirjam">https://www.slideshare.net/DevDays/fhir-search-for-clients-mirjam</a> and have a question about _revinclude.<br>
As I understood, if I try GET [base] / Patient ? _revinclude=Observation:subject, the result is a searchset bundle having patient resources and Observation resources whose subjects refer the patient resources meeting the search criteria. But I cannot find any test server to test _revinclude. <br>
I would like to ask whether what I understand is correct, and any test server to test _revinclude with sample queries.<br>
Thank you in advance<br>
Best<br>
Joonggeon Lee</p>

<p>Your understanding is correct.  I believe the <a href="http://healthintersections.com.au" target="_blank" title="http://healthintersections.com.au">healthintersections.com.au</a> server works (be sure you're testing the STU 3 version).  That said, the query you're making is a dangerous one.  A given patient may have thousands or tens of thousands of observations.  So if you execute the search and set a page size of 50 patients, you could easily get back 500k Observations in your first page.  (And you may find that some servers will therefore refuse to perform the query)</p>

<p>I don't support _revinclude yet. I think the HAPI server does</p>
