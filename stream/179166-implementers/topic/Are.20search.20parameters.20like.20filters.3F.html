<p>On my reading: if a FHIR search returns a specific set results, then adding search parameters would filter these down to a subset of those results. For example, searching for <code>Condition?patient=123</code> returns all conditions, and <code>Condition?patient=123&amp;clinicalStatus=resolved</code> returns a subset of all conditions.</p>
<p>However, some implementation have different/special "default" rules, so that <code>Condition?patient=123</code> returns a restricted set of results. This behavior has surprised me, and caused me to miss out on relevant data in my "fetch all" queries. I've heard similar experiences from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191414">@Dan Gottlieb</span>  and from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191339">@Pascal Pfiffner</span>, with respect to default rules in open.epic.</p>
<p>My take: an app developer following the FHIR spec, or Argonaut / US Core, expects to see all available conditions (and meds, etc) when searching without a status filter. Indeed, the spec and the IGs seem to require it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-condition.html" target="_blank" title="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-condition.html">e.g. in US Core</a>, </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>GET /Condition?patient=[id]
Example: GET [base]/Condition?patient=1032702
Support: Mandatory to support search by patient.
</pre></div>


<p>I'd like to discuss here. Would someone make a case that it's good for interoperability or patient safety for different EHRs to set different default rules on this kind of search?</p>

<p>I think vendor specific configuration isn't great -- though realistically we'll probably never get entirely away from it <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191912">@Michele Mottini</span> . What scares me the most in this case is that the query is handled but silently (or at least, automatically) altered without an http error response -- so a developer is very likely not to notice what is going on. This happened to me and I've heard reports from others as well.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>  It would push me towards acceptable. There are a lot of situations, such as handling=lenient or the thread about the server's discretion to apply only parts of a PUT request that it thinks are appropriate, where the spec is structured as "the server has broad discretion but reports back to the client what it chose to do".</p>
<p>Based on that pattern, if the extra parameters are in the self link at least the client knows what it got.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge is: If a client <em>didn't</em> get what it wanted, how can it choose to then get it?  It's hard to program in advance to accommodate arbitrary extra filters that get added.  It's not as though you can just query again with no filters and say "no, this is what I really want!".</p>

<p>Considering this from a different angle, the search is always filtered by "resources the client has access to" which could be very opaque. The client often doesn't know the scope of what is hidden, and there are no query terms that will return more.</p>
<p>Do "default search terms" contain some way to convince the server of what you really want? Is there a magic word to get Epic to give you non-active MedicationOrders?</p>

<p>Indeed, coping/updating queries in-band is unrealistic for all but the most sophisticated clients. I assume the expected behavior is "1. read the docs, 2. recognize where they might contradict the base spec or any IGs, and 3. update your app's query configuration with special cases." Since the docs are long and largely redundant across vendors, 1 and 2 are hard in practice (and 3 is tedious) especially for apps that want to connect dynamically to a variety of API providers.</p>

<p>If Argonaut or US core wanted to eliminate the "bare" API call and document only the call with a status list, that'd be verbose but at least explicit / less surprising. Then a server could refuse queries that lacked a status.</p>

<p>Regarding Epic's support - our intent is to represent data as safetly as possible. For medication searches especially, the thought is if by default you only get the active meds this would make it hard to miss represent what the patient is actively taking and avoid unsafe representations of a patient's meds. </p>
<p>I do realize this behavior is hard to know without reading a given server's documentation and that isn't ideal. Maybe it is something we can more formally adopt in US Core/Argonaut profiles if others feel this scenario makes sense or sees a value in it. I'd be happy to discuss it further on an upcoming Argonaut call <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191410">@Brett Marquard</span> or <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span></p>

<p>In what I would consider a more common scenario - it seems reasonable to me that servers would not return "entered-in-error" statuses by default as this information is no longer valid and maybe not even discoverable without the old reference (such as by FHIR ID). What do others think of that type of defaulting scenario?</p>

<p>The point of an "entered in error" status is that it's deemed important to let others know that the record existed.  (Otherwise, you'd just execute a delete.)  I guess the question is whether we trust systems to pay attention to 'modifier' elements  in resources they retrieve.  If they don't do that, there's no way such a system can be safe period.  (If they don't check status, there's little chance that they're looking for modifier extensions or at more esoteric elements such as Resource.implicitRules.)   I think the community would be better off with consistent APIs but with some up-front checking that systems you connect to have actually looked at all of the FHIR safety rules and do what they're supposed to do.  After all, all of the EHRs have processes they use to determine whether a given client/consumer is 'safe' to access the data.  It seems that this is something that could be verified as part of that process.</p>

<p>I agree with Lloyd on this point-- if an app developer doesn't understand the basic essential properties of a medication resource or a condition resource, there is zero chance that developer is going to build a safe app. Trying to fix this through clever defaults won't really put a dent in this.</p>

<p>to my mind, it would be better to get agreement about this at the level of the base specification rather than in a particular community like Argonaut, unless we think there's really something community specific about the right answer.</p>

<p>"more clear" isn't really enough.  The client has to have some degree of control over what's coming back and it's very difficult for clients (without customizing on a per-server basis - which is the last thing we want) to be able to get what they want if a server applies filters by default.  When a server ignores certain filters and tells you, the client can let the user know and/or pick up the slack.  However, if a server adds extra stuff, the client can let the user know that they're missing stuff, but (without customization) can't actually get the data.</p>

<p>I will clarify a bit. </p>
<p>We validate every application in our app store. Our health care systems expect that of us. Michele is right that patient facing applications cannot be forced through validation. A patient has the right to chose an application of their choosing to access the data. NPRM calls out that health systems have the final authority on connected applications, but vendors cannot force themselves in the middle of that process. Applications that aren't validated are not listed on the app store. The app store is not a requirement to obtain access to the APIs, but some health systems do prefer to know that the app has been validated.</p>
<p>With regards to statuses and safety. There is an oversimplification of the problem, and potentially clarification on what the daily life of an EHR vendor is like. I think there is a level of ambiguity on expectations around client/server query and response behaviors. In the example listed in this thread, we returned all medications that have a statuses. We <em>DO NOT</em> under any circumstances return medications that we do not know the status for even though unknown is in the value set. It is clinically unsafe, and we would be putting patient safety at risk. As an EHR vendor, we have responsibilities and processes in place that require us to  to take all preventative measures to mitigate these risks and liability. Another example would be data that has been changed to "entered-in-error". We do not return any fields to mitigates concerns around unintended re-disclosure of health information. We return an ID, a status, and all other required fields return displays of "unknown". This is done to understand state change, but nothing else. We will never expose additional details because of concerns around comments/notes that may lead to someone learning information that they shouldn't have known in the first place.</p>
<p>I would ask that instead of trying to "fix" the behaviors of the different servers, we take a moment to understand scenarios in which EHRs would "hide" data, and why it is done. This would then allow the collective community to propose viable options that both mitigates risks, increase patient safety, and improve the exchange of data.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> there is no such certifying body in the US. There are examples in our validation process where we have caught developers not paging across the entire data set, not displaying statuses correctly, and not removing/updating resources that are no longer valid. I would love to be able to not let those developers connect, but that isn't possible the regulatory landscape we operate in. </p>
<p>I think one option I have thought of in the past is actually not supporting queries without status filters. This creates a contract where the API consumer explicitly asks for the status they understand and are interested in. This mitigates concerns servers may have about the consumer not understanding statuses. Until some sort of guidance in provided like this, there will always be business rules applied to protect the implementation from undue liability.</p>

<p>hah - treating it differently? well, I can see the sense in that. And I appreciate that whatever you do has trade-offs. In fact, that's kind of my point here. But actually, I'm worried about a longer term point - the tradeoffs that have been chosen scope limit the API to a particular set of uses that will become problematic in the longer term because they assume current information only, and past information - records of past encounters, documents, and decisions made in particular - are going to be a problem given the short term decisions made</p>

<p>That is completely fair. In the race to expose APIs to meet regulations, things like this were left for different systems to figure out along the way. I know I have asked about "defaulting" behavior in the past, but competing priorities and timing are challenging to manage.</p>

<p>Putting rules around what data is returned puts us in a "well it depends" scenario that defeats what we're trying to accomplish. The response should be an accurate representation of the data based on what's being asked for in the query.  Doing otherwise results in what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191912">@Michele Mottini</span>  has done - include vendor-specific rules to interpret the results. Conceivably we could end up with a situation where every app developer must code specifically for each service (to account for it's rules) and each server must code specifically for each application (what's "safe" to send to them).</p>

<p>Having said that, Allscripts also incorporates business rules into our results, including filtering by status (e.g. only sending lab Observations whose status is final).

<p>I'm not actually sure that requiring the statuses in the request help this.

<p>Just seeing this thread now, but completely agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> and will add my name to the list of people who have been bitten by vendors adding their own special rules regarding default queries.  More specifically, I had an app for which historical med data was important -- so one vendor's choice to return only active medications caused some confusion in testing.  Developers of interoperable applications (like SMART Apps) cannot read the documentation of <em>every</em> Health IT product w/ a FHIR interface.  The point of standards is to allow some basic assumptions to be made -- and this specific topic (behavior of search queries) falls into that category for me.</p>
<p>IMO, If we want to allow vendor variance in areas like this, then the FHIR spec should explicitly call out these areas where vendors are allowed to add their own rules.  That way responsible app developers who <em>do</em> know and understand the FHIR specification aren't burned and know to program more defensively in those spots.  And if this is allowed, then I think there needs to be a mechanism for the client to know that additional non-standard rules have been applied.  But my personal preference is that a "standard" should be implemented in a "standard" way across all vendors as much as is possible.</p>

<p>I don't think that reading documentation of every health IT product scales.  Yes, if you're targeting three vendors, sure.  But there are <em>way</em> more than three vendors out there that support FHIR -- and part of the point of SMART (I <em>think</em>) is to one day support an App Store paradigm that is at least partially vendor-agnostic.  Things are a whole lot easier if we can set some ground rules that allow vanilla apps to work across the widest variety of vendors' products.  If vendors have to rely on app-developers specifically targeting their system, I worry that the smaller vendors will have a real hard time surviving in the future marketplace.</p>

<p>In reality, each server has its own capability. You cannot expect all servers support the same set of resources and same set of search parameter. I cannot image how a client developer can get that information w/o reading vendor documents no matter how many system he want to connect.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192087">@Avinash Shanbhag</span> I think that one part of this is tricky - the question of the safety of apps for the patient. If the US Govt requires patients to be able to choose their apps - for very good reasons - where can a patient turn for a good app that's reliable? if supposedly experienced healthcare developers can't get the basics like checking status correct, what does the govt expect to happen for patients?</p>

<p>I think part of the challenge is that servers should not make assumptions about the use-case of their clients.  The EHRs created their interface with a presumption that it was going to be used by patient-centric apps and focused on meeting meaningful-use criteria - specifically the ability to share a list of a patient's active medicaitons.  But the MedicationRequest query endpoint isn't intrinsicly use-case specific and there are lots of valid use-cases for retrieving things other than the active med list (and for performing queries that aren't patient-centric).  It is certainly ok to have limintations in query parameters that focus on the initial use-cases for a first release, but default filtering for a presumed use-case is more problematic.  Lack of search parameters doesn't prevent a use-case from being satisfied, it just makes it inefficient.  But automatic filters can prevent a use-case from being predictably satisfied at all.  Eventually, the EHR MedicaionRequest endpoints will likely need to expose draft ordrs, recommendations that came in as part of a referral response from 5 years ago and all sorts of other MedicationRequest instances that have no relationship to the "active medication list" at all - but for which there's absolutely a valid use-case for exchange.  (And as that evolution happens, we'll start to see some of the pain of not having List to filter the sets of records that are truly part of the active med list as opposed to being resources that are part of the record for other reasons.)</p>

<p>Chiming in a bit late, but I think we need to recognize the split between FHIR "insiders" vs. "outsiders" as client developers.  I'd estimate that ~95%+ of the app vendors we deal with don't know or care about the FHIR spec.  They just want data, an if we gave that to them in a CSV, custom JSON/XML, HL7v2, or valid FHIR response, they wouldn't care either way.  They will never be parsing CapabilityStatement in a meaningful way.  The other ~5% are the insiders like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191912">@Michele Mottini</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> who understand both the FHIR spec and the complexities of healthcare data.  EHR vendors are in the position where we need to support both sets of users.  My experience is overwhelmingly that we cannot expect the majority of clients to handle the complexity of healthcare data on their own.</p>

<p>Speaking from the server/EHR vendor perspective, the basic issue is a lack of comfort about how the data will be used once it leaves our curatorship. Some sort of app certification process or a registration process (dynamic or otherwise) based on an agreed-upon set of rules (no idea how that would work) would go a long way towards increasing that comfort level.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>  My insider/outsider comments are driven by my real-world experiences to date. I've been on design or troubleshooting calls or e-mail chains with vendors probably ~5-10 times per week for the past several years.  I'm just trying to represent the reality of FHIR use today.  I'm open to practical and implementable solutions that move the needle, but, for example, the calls with S4S and MyFHR developers go <em>very</em> differently than the calls with most other app developers...</p>

<p>Typically the "default search parameters" are just a way to allow the EHR to make sure the data that is returned in the API matches what is shown to clinical users inside the EHR.  Within the EHR, we often have some sort of "more info" or "show all" button that clinicians can use to get the full picture, but a lot of time and effort has gone into determining what data is relevant to show in the primary lists.  E.g. if a resident ordered a bunch of labs the the supervisor determined those labs were unnecessary and canceled them (prior to specimen draw), then it normally isn't useful to show those canceled labs to users 6 months later.    The way I understand this thread is that we want to replicate the "more info" option that we have in the EHR (which today we support by the documented additional (vendor specific, but spec compliant) search parameters that can be provided).</p>

<p>One solution is to return everything by default with some sort of flag to indicate if it should be in the "default" view.  However this means we have to just "hope" that clients will understand that flag.  And I'm very much pessimistic about that.</p>

<p>What about instead of filtering by default make the corresponding search parameter required? So the client has to specify what it wants (and for the 95% just tell them 'do the search like this')</p>

<p>I follow the logic for matching the system standard view. I feel that matching a no parameters query to the limited system view is where we get into trouble. Given your concerns, I would:<br>
- refuse to answer any query that doesn't explicitly say which status codes to return <br>
- explain in the return error that you either specify the status codes, or use something like argonaut-view=default to request what would be the default view in the system<br>
- support the default-view parameter<br>
- publish a safety check list - preferably through Argonaut<br>
- ask applications to confirm that they've done the checklist on registration</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191764">@Cooper Thompson</span> "Relevant" presupposes a known use-case.  The API should not do that.  The whole point of REST is that the API is use-case independent.  It's not supposed to reflect what's on a particular screen or view.  It's supposed to reflect all data that fits that resource category that's available from the persistence layer of the system.  Consumers of the API then filter to reflect whatever their use-case happens to be.  The key is to make sure that app implementers <em>expect</em> the feed to contain non-relevant data - and know that it's their responsibility to filter accordingly.</p>

<p>I agree with Lloyd on this point-- if an app developer doesn't understand the basic essential properties of a medication resource or a condition resource, there is zero chance that developer is going to build a safe app. Trying to fix this through clever defaults won't really put a dent in this.</p>

<p>[Does this branch need to get renamed?]</p>
<p>The following must be read with awareness that I haven't read (and am unlikely to competently absorb) FHIR safety rules or anything else.  I don't have the background or bandwidth to claim competence on it.  Having said that, I think I understand the issue; I can loosely understand the issue, what's going on in the sample URLs, etc.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Dude, no wonder I had trouble finding this thread from your email - your email cited "patient safety" which is absolutely true but not mentioned verbatim. Hey,  this is almost meta: How would I inform you algorithmically that what I queried in your data store (the thread) was not found, even though it's there? (I know that's not the same as inactive rx; work with me here...)</p>
<p>I have a feeling that some queriers basically want to say "Hey system, tell me everything I need to know, and don't screw up."  And some servers prefer to be passive-aggressive, saying "If you want a useful response, you can bloody well be explicit about it, or don't blame me." Who's responsible, and what can be done about the dysfunction / lack of accepting responsibility?</p>
<p>Yes, this is real, and it's really really hard for either party to know what datum might blow up in one's face - especially since the answer to that may change as the patient history gets older and as patient circumstances get added.  Right??  Is this solvable?  So how can one judge who should bear responsibility?  Responsibility connotes having the wisdom and facts to avoid danger and to warn at appropriate times.</p>
<p>In clinical reality does the issue get more predictable after N days of a patient encounter?  Perhaps not reliably so. </p>
<p>To really handle issues like this well, we should recruit <em>seriously experienced</em> care coordinators (e.g. years-long care managers for elder family members) who have the scars and savvy to help us consider real-world hazards. Names that come to mind are Janice McCallum and Maryanne Sterling. And I bet they'll say they want at LEAST a read-only "view window" to check on the daily chatter ... people like those two could absolutely qualify as competent for that.</p>
<p>In fact, what a hot idea - enrolling "atrics" caregivers (pediatrics and geriatrics).  At the other end of the lifespan there are numerous parents of seriously sick kids who have all too much experience with the need for bedside vigilance, having repeatedly rescued their sick kids from accidental harm.  Tyson Ortiz is one of these.  </p>
<p>All three of them are members of SPM, not surprisingly.</p>

<p><strong>Hey, folks! Sorry for the late reply here, I'm just catching up. Here are my observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of the <em>most important principles</em> in safety is consistency. This is the entire point of Atul Gawande's book, The Checklist Manifesto. No matter the intention, we are actively creating and perpetuating a patent safety issue if the standard is inconsistently applied.<ul>
<li>The example given by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191356">@Jenni Syed</span> is perfect: "I can provide the stat that 0 times has any app made it through our validation without an issue found" - this is exactly the outcome I would expect with inconsistent implementations across vendors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the issue of the implementation itself, I don't have a super strong opinion. The current convention of passing along all data if no status is specified seems to be the most logical and future-proof (i.e., if a new status is ever added in the future, it would still work as expected), but explicitly requiring statuses would also be acceptable assuming it was implemented by everyone consistently.</li>
<li>EHR vendors can't make assumptions about how data will be used by apps that consume the API. We ran into this early because some EHR vendors assumed data would be queried each time and never persisted. As has been mentioned, this is why returning entered-in-error and inactive status is critical vs simply not sending anything anymore.<ul>
<li>As an example, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191764">@Cooper Thompson</span> pointed out that one of their goals is to ensure that the data "returned in the API matches what is shown to clinical users inside the EHR." This is reasonable on its face, but makes the assumption that all apps will behave like their EHR, or has the same access to historical data as their EHR.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Agree with comments above by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191469">@Chris Moesel</span> that reading the documentation of all vendors doesn't scale. Does anyone believe that OAuth 2.0 implementors read the documentation of every site where it has been implemented, or do they refer to the IETF specs? Same should be true here - the US Core or Argonaut IGs should be the source(s) of truth for documentation.</li>
<li>Data is not the responsibility of health systems or EHR vendors once it leaves the system, assuming the app developer is not a business associate of the covered entity. This question has been laid to rest ages ago and is described in more detail on <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/3009/does-a-hipaa-covered-entity-bear-liability.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/3009/does-a-hipaa-covered-entity-bear-liability.html">the OCR FAQ page here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where do we go from here? Some thoughts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We should align on one approach. I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> that it makes the most sense to do this as part of the base spec, although having the conversation as part of the Argonaut R4 discussions would also be fine, assuming the outcome was applied to the base spec.</li>
<li>It would be more valuable to provide a comprehensive safety overview/how-to for inexperienced developers along with a consistent API than it would be to attempt to protect developers from themselves in inconsistent and dangerous ways (which is current state). Agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194368">@Julie Maas</span> that we should try something like this.</li>

<p>This is such an important topic! I fully agree that apps should understand and properly handle the full resource life cycle, especially the entered-in-error status. With regard to apps that locally persist resources, I think we also need to look carefully at other ways resources may become "invalid" with respect to an app's use case where resource status might not communicate this. A few observations:<br>
1. It seems to me that any time a resource element that is a Reference is updated, this could cause resources to no longer be valid for the app's use case, and could also prevent the app from receiving any future updates about status changes. In the simplest example, if an Observation resource is updated to change the subject reference, it will no longer be a valid Observation for the original patient and will simply disappear for an app that only has access to the original subject's Observations (i.e. the app will not receive a status change).<br>
2. I expect some will argue that a server should never allow the subject of an Observation to be updated, and should instead mark the original resource as entered-in-error and create a second resource with the correct subject reference, but I don't think that this part of the formal FHIR spec (? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> ). It gets more difficult to manage when apps rely on chaining in their searches, so if such a rule were imposed in the interest of safety, it should probably be extended to prohibit changing any element of an existing resource that is a reference. I don't think such a rule would be very popular.<br>
3. It gets even worse if an app is "deauthorized" from a particular resource after it has retrieved it, because if that resource's status is later changed to entered-in-error or the resource is otherwise changed in a clinically relevant way, the app will not receive the update.<br>
4. Patient unmerge/unlink: similar to #1.<br>
5. Given the above, it seems that there is no easy way for an app to be certain it is synchronized with a server's database using only RESTful calls; to be fully protected from the above, it may need to repeat queries for all data it wishes to persist every time and remove or otherwise invalidate any locally persisted resources that had "disappeared" from the search results. It seems like this might be a best practice from a safety perspective. Grahame touched on this earlier in the thread in the context of medication lists.<br>
6. It follows from 5 that apps that use a _lastUpdated parameter in their searches set relative to their last search would have no way to determine that a previously retrieved resource had disappeared, and are vulnerable to persisting data that becomes clinically invalid for one of the above reasons.</p>

<p>I'd think the word "matches" is a recipe for mischief, true?  Both the encoding and the display of data, <em>as perceived and interpreted by the reader</em>, can be substantially affected by context and by user experience, both within that EHR (e.g. Cerner) and within that institution, yes?</p>

<p>EHR screens are use-case-specific.  FHIR APIs <em>should</em> be use-case agnostic.  Expecting them to expose exactly the same data isn't appropriate/reasonable.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="195299">@Luis Maas</span> that's a good list. There's some really tricky stuff there - the app might decide how to proceed differently between the entered-in-error case and the security withdrawn case, but I don't think it can separate them. </p>
<p>I strongly believe that subject should never be changed - if you created something with the wrong subject, you should not just 'fix' it. But in practice, lots of systems do just that</p>

<p>Adding to Luis' list, data may also become unavailable because of storage policies on the server, e.g. a server only making data available for the past 5 years. So an app is not seeing a resource again doesn't mean that a resource has been deleted or entered-in-error. And who knows what HTTP status such a server can return for data that's no longer available.</p>
