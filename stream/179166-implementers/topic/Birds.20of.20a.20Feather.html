<p>Digital health innovation is transforming health care. Patients are experiencing new opportunities to engage with their care teams and physicians can use data in new ways. The AMA’s content, resources and expertise in medical terminology is helping develop a generation of software and technology that expands the bounds of science---making the health system work better for everyone and enhancing patient care. To help developers to turn amazing ideas into innovations, the AMA plans to announce a new online space devoted to the needs of developers with no-fee registration to access to the AMA’s best CPT content and resources.
