<p>I am brand new to this group (that was recommended to me by someone at HL7), so I hope that I am posting to the right group.</p>
<p>My company sells a device for help people learn to walk again after various forms of trauma. During our therapy sessions, our system records data related to the session goals and statistics. We would like to provide this data in a format that can easily be used by many EMR systems. This is what led me to FHIR. As a complete novice to this spec, any help that could point to the section of the FHIR Resourcelist would be very helpful.</p>
<p>We currently have our data being returned via a request to our device in JSON format, but it is just a generic schema that we devised at this point. Thanks so much for any help that you can provide.</p>

<p>First, read the "First Time Here?" section at the top of the spec (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir">http://hl7.org/fhir</a>).  Then take a look at the CarePlan, Goal and Observation resources as they seem most likely to be useful based on your description.  After you've done that, feel free to come back here with more detailed questions :)</p>
