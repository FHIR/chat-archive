<p>Hi all,<br>
Very new to FHIR. The question I have is that if I am using FHIR does that mean that data duplication is avoided? Let's take an example. Patient A registers at the hospital, gets sent to the lab and has a Covid Test at the airport. If all three system are connected to the same FHIR datasource, I should be able to pull a single view of the patient? Is my assumption correct? If I am unable to do this, its the FHIR implementation done wrong?</p>

<p>It depends what you mean by "Connected". You can use FHIR to create one master record that all the others use. But you don't have to. "Connected" may mean they can all share data, or synchronize, but each has its own local copy also. FHIR is a technology that allows you to access data, and move it around and share it. It does not tell you which copy is the main or only one or who may have other copies. There are lots of data architectures possible. There is no "wrong" in that respect.</p>

<p>Hi Rik, Thanks for the response. I understand a little better. Basically, it boils down to allowing whatever is required but each system must have the intention of using it in that way.</p>

<p>that is true yes</p>
