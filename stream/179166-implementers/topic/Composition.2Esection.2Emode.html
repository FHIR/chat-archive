<p>Composition.section is a lot like a simplification of List, with some elements omitted, as the values are inherited from the containing composition.<br>
I'm puzzled  by Composition.section.mode. The structure looks fine for mode=snapshot. But for mode=changes, surely it needs the supporting information that List has in List.entry.flag, .deleted and maybe .date. Simply saying that the section is a set of changes without being able to say what kind the changes are seems underdone.</p>
