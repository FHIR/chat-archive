<p>Hello!<br>
I am looking for a FHIR resource that would allow us to record data received from CMS specific to HCC (Hierarchical Condition Categories). The information we receive includes: </p>
<p>member_id  -&gt; the  ID card of the member<br>
cond_year  -&gt; the current MRA year<br>
cond_key -&gt; the HCC code<br>
cond_desc -&gt; HCC name<br>
cond_status -&gt; HCC status ID <br>
Current_HCC_Status -&gt; current condition status description<br>
Prior_HCC_Status -&gt; previous condition status description<br>
Current_Service_Date -&gt; HCC current service dates<br>
Prior_Service_Date -&gt; HCC past service dates<br>
Status_Code_This_Year -&gt; condition status current year<br>
Status_Code_Last_Year -&gt;  condition status previous year<br>
cond_status_desc -&gt; condition status description<br>
risk_factor -&gt; projected HCC score for MRA for current MRA year<br>
Is_incremental -&gt; Y indicator that states if HCC was also documented during an in Home Assessment<br>
Incremental_dos -&gt; Date that the HCC was documented during In Home Assessment<br>
rptg_mth_date_skey -&gt; Period ending date(data received up to this date)<br>
cond_update_date -&gt; Date that condition was updated/added to source</p>
<p>We are thinking in using the FHIR observation resource and then adding extensions to it. But I wonder if somebody else has tackled a similar problem?<br>
Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>This would map to a few Condition instances plus a bunch of observations and probably a few extensions thrown in for good measure.  It's a real hodge-podge of stuff.  Have you considered Questionnaire/QuestionnaireResponse?  It's quite good at handling hodge-podges and it's not clear you have a business case for extracting this information into its constitutent resource instances.</p>

<p>Thank you both!<br>
Didn't think of using Questionnaire/QuestionnarieResponse but it is a great hint. </p>
