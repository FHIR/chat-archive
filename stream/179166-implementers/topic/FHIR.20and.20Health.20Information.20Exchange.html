<p>I have some questions regarding a scenario:<br>
Considering if FHIR is adopted by a country or state and imagine all the hospitals have their own FHIR server (there can be different profiles for resources). Every FHIR server has some patients.<br>
PatientA that is part of FhirServerA in HospitalA, if PatientA will go to the HospitalB for check up where FhirServerB is deployed. what will happen?<br>
what comes in my mind is, FhirServerB will get the required resources related to PatientA resource from FhirServerA. Then doctor will check up the PatientA in HospitalB and will store the Observation resource regarding check up in FhirServerB.</p>
<p>Kindly correct me maybe I am wrong somewhere</p>

<p>It'll be much the same as now.  The second hospital will create records reflecting whatever information they deem relevant - whether that information comes from the patient or another hospital.  The second hospital *can*, if they wish, create an internal linkage between their Resource id and the URL of the first hospital's resource so they can keep in sync going forward.</p>

<p>IHE has profiles that show what Lloyd is describing. Their classic set of PIX/PDQ/XDS/XCA have been cast into FHIR and come out as PIXm/PDQm/MHD... etc. The question you ask is more of an operational question, which the standards and profiles can only define as far as giving support, where the operational environment must make decisions on the way they will implement. Some may choose to centralize a MPI, some may choose to federate, some may choose to dynamically discover.</p>
