<p>From my understanding, the TerminologyCapabilities resource is meant to list the CodeSystems that "are supported by the server" as well as details about the different operations that the server can perform. Should this list ALL CodeSystems stored on a server (i.e. those representing simple value sets that are expanded in drop down menus, such as gender) or only the big "medical-specific" CodeSystems such as LOINC and SNOMED?</p>

<p>About all that we have said directly about that so far is the first sentence on the resource <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/terminologycapabilities.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/terminologycapabilities.html">page</a>: "A TerminologyCapabilities resource documents a set of capabilities (behaviors) of a FHIR Terminology Server that may be used as a statement of actual server functionality or a statement of required or desired server implementation."  Currently the resource is draft (maturity level = 0), so it's very much subject to (and expected to have) change.  We will certainly want to clarify the expectations around this as we create further documentation and obtain further Connectathon and implementation experience.  In regard to your specific question, my expectation is that normally the terminology capability statement would include <strong>all</strong> of the code systems and value sets that are supported by the server.  If you have more questions you may want to consider posting them on the <a href="#narrow/stream/179202-terminology" title="#narrow/stream/179202-terminology">terminology</a> stream.</p>
