<p>I am working on a example mapping a list of conditions from CDA observation-condition to FHIR condition. One of the condition has priorityCode primary, others are non-primary. How do I say the same in FHIR?</p>

<p>I am doing an example for China FHIR group from one of their CDA document. The value in the priorityCode is, translated as, primary diagnosis (or major diagnosis). And other conditions have the value of "other diagnosis".</p>

<p>This is usually in the context of an encounter, episode of care or claim.  All of those should allow (either in core or via extension) the ability to assign a sequence to the condition.  Standing outside the context of one of those things, I've never seen a use case for any particular condition being "primary" for the patient overall, regardless of what practitioner/individual is looking at the data.</p>

<p>Condition.category is a very different thing.  It allows you to differentiate symptoms from diagnoses, etc.  Encounter has an extension to allow indication of the "primary" diagnosis - <a href="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/extension-encounter-primarydiagnosis.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/extension-encounter-primarydiagnosis.html">http://hl7-fhir.github.io/extension-encounter-primarydiagnosis.html</a>.

<p>We've seen these indicators (primary or principal) used fairly often in quality measures.  While I can understand the desire to put such a tag on the Condition itself, I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> that it's fairly meaningless outside of the context of the encounter to which it pertains.  It also becomes a bit troublesome when working with chronic conditions.  For example, consider a Condition for diabetes that had an onset 5 years ago.  The patient has had 20 encounters since then.  If the condition is flagged as <code>primary</code>, which encounter (or encounters) was it the primary for?  Flagging the Condition only works if you're going to create a separate Condition entry for every encounter in which it is addressed (which you might do, but I don't think we should force people to do it just to support this particular use case).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191469">@Chris Moesel</span> , in the example of a chronic condition that was treated in context of 20 encounters, we would have 21 condition instances.  A single condition instance #1 for the chronic condition with category = problem, and no encounter specified.  Condition instances #2 through #21 would each have a category = diagnosis and a specific Condition.encounter populated.  Condition.encounter has a cardinality of 0..1, so there shouldn't be any question about which encounter the Condition.role/rank (if supported) applies  to.  </p>

<p>Per the usage note on Condition.encounter.....  "This record indicates the encounter this particular record is associated with. In the case of a "new" diagnosis reflecting ongoing/revised information about the condition, this might be distinct from the first encounter in which the underlying condition was first known."  Thus, Condition.encounter is NOT constrained to the onset encounter when the chronic condition was first diagnosed.</p>

<p>Thanks for the info, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191403">@Michelle (Moseman) Miller</span>.  I wondered if something like that might be the case, but was confused by the fact that the "preferred" value set for <a href="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/valueset-condition-category.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/valueset-condition-category.html">Condition.category</a> does not have any <code>problem</code> code.  It has only <code>complaint</code>, <code>symptom</code>, <code>finding</code>, and <code>diagnosis</code>.  So using the preferred value set, there isn't as obvious a way to distinguish between the longitudinal problem and the encounter diagnosis.  There also isn't a good way to tie the encounter diagnoses to the longitudinal problem so that it's clear they are all referencing the same underlying problem.</p>

<p>Regarding the consequence of representing all billed diagnoses as a single 'chronic' Condition might trigger the question of what the Condition.code should be?  For example, problems (in the US) are most often SNOMED, but diagnoses are ICD.  When we discussed the possibility of "translating" SNOMED to ICD-X codes, we intentionally didn't do that because the ICD code could add inaccurate information—like initial encounter -- which isn't relevant to all billed diagnoses across all encounters.</p>

<p>Good points on all.  The difference in coding systems does make that problematic, doesn't it?  When something happens, like the condition resolves, are all of the individual diagnosis records updated?  I would guess that is not the case, but then it makes the tail end of this guidance on abatementDate less relevant: "If there is no abatement element, it is unknown whether the condition has resolved or entered remission; applications and users should generally assume that the condition is still valid".  Modeling health info is tough stuff!</p>

<p>Hi all. In China FHIR community, we just had an extensive discussion regarding how to properly represent multiple conditions using FHIR, and there is no clear answer. </p>
<p>The use case is that one system (SysA) needs to send a patient's active problem list to another system (SysB) for whatever reasons.  The patient has AMI, Hypertension, and Diabetes. Of whcih, AMI is the primary diagnosis (a.k.a the key condition) and is the main reason of current hospital stay and care service. During FHIR data exchange, SysA needs to specifically tell sysB that the AMI is primary diagnosis(key-condition) and the rest diagnosis are none-key-conditions .</p>
<p>To make it more complex, each diagnosis (AMI, Hypertension, Diabetes) has additional flag to indicate whether the diagnosis was confirmed when patient was first admitted. (1 = confirmed, 2 = not sure, 3=unknown, 4=no ). </p>
<p>hopfully I clearly explained the use case.  The question is: does FHIR has a clear way to express above information?  Thanks.</p>

<p>The problem is that for any given problem there maybe a <code>provisional</code> and a set of <code>differential</code> diagnoses. But often patients have a set of "possible" co-morbidites that are important but yet to be confirmed.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> can you elaborate on why Linkage is preferred?  In the example mentioned earlier, we could have one condition with Condition.category = problem and no Condition.encounter.  We would have 20 more conditions with Condition.category = diagnosis, each with a distinct Condition.encounter.  I can see Linkage being used to link all 21 diabetes-related conditions together, but using Linkage to represent priority is where you lost me.  I didn't think the scope of Linkage was encouraging links between different types of resources (e.g. Encounter and Condition).  Additionally, the priority/rank/primary is still within the context of a single encounter (meaning all 20 diabetes diagnoses could all have a priority/rank/primary = 1), so I'm not sure why the Linkage resource is preferable to the encounter extension (even though I still wish it were an extension on condition instead of encounter)? </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191403">@Michelle (Moseman) Miller</span> I agree. If the purpose of using Linkage is to link all records for the same chronic condition, it can be also achieved by search Condition?code=xxx&amp;clinicalStatus=xxx. Back to the topic, since priority is still within context of a specific encounter, I think the extension should be on Encounter.indication. If you need to know the priority of in a specific encounter, you can either go through Condition.encounter reference link to Encounter.indication.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191403">@Michelle (Moseman) Miller</span> My understanding of what you were describing was linking multiple instances of the same condition together, but distinguishing one as primary.  Linkage lets you do that.  If you want to distinguish primary vs. secondary for different diagnoses, that has to be done in the context of an Encounter, EpisodeOfCare, Claim or something else.</p>

<p>We're creating different conditions (each with their own <a href="http://Condition.id" target="_blank" title="http://Condition.id">Condition.id</a>) to represent each billed diagnosis for 'diabetes' at different points in time (encounter).  Each encounter would have its own primary/principal diagnosis, such that each condition could be primary for its encounter.  </p>
<p>By contrast, we aren't creating a single diabetes condition to represent both the billed diagnosis (ICD code) and chronic problem (SNOMED) on the problem list.</p>
<p>Looking forward to Health Concerns, I could see Linkage being valuable when linking all of the diabetes-related conditions together.</p>

<p>the notion of a conditions priority for a given encounter is often very arbitrary - they often dont let doctors choose these but delegate to specialist coders who can choose the best one based on which code will be most lucrative for the hospital</p>
