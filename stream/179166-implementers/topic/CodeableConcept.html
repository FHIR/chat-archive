<p>The CodeableConcept consists of a code that has a 1 to many cardinality. But I assume that the 'many' part of this cardinality refers to translations of the same item. Sometimes in the PHD world, one has features that are represented by codes but several of them. For example I have a device that supports both Blood pressure and thermometer specializations. Both are static. How would I represent such a static device in FHIR?</p>

<p>mutliple observations</p>

<p>Multiple Observations? In PHD such a device is called HYDRA. So in the Device resource I would have a type of HYDRA. So what you are saying is that I would need Observation resources with a type SYSTEM TYPE SPEC LIST and value THERMOMETER and type SYSTEM TYPE SPEC LIST and value BLOOD PRESSURE, respectively. Somehow I would have liked to put that in the Device. Would the DeviceMetric do the job? (Would like a way to indicate that it is static.)</p>

<p>For each observation you have a reference to Devicemetric  that should allow you to define the "channel" or "mode" or whatever you call it.   Or the observation code could define all  this as well. </p>

<p>Yes either a reference to DeviceMetric or it could be defined in the code</p>
