<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Apologies if this topic has already been discussed but I couldn't find any information regarding this issue.</p>
<p>The Art. 17 of GDPR requires the service to allow user to delete their data. The current delete operation in FHIR Rest API is a soft delete so it seems like we will need to support hard delete of the resource and its history in order to be GDPR compliant. I didn't see any special rule only applicable to healthcare data so I am assuming hard delete will be a requirement just like for any other personal data.</p>
<p>Is there any discussion about this already and what is the guidance on supporting GDPR requirements?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The RESTful delete is <em>allowed</em> to be a soft delete, but servers are allowed to execute a hard delete if they choose.</p>

<p>As Lloyd points out, FHIR has defined a DELETE operation; it is up to systems to look to policy on what DELETE means.  Thus in a GDPR environment, DELETE could be a hard delete, in a different environment DELETE could just set a security tag that prevents most from seeing it.</p>

<p>There is an identified gap that it would be nice to have a deleteMe operation that would not just delete the obvious FHIR Resources, but would also forward the request to deleteMe to other organizations that are known to have received information about that data.  This could leverage the AuditEvent for export  events. This is just a thought at this point, no one has started that project.</p>

<p>I envisage we'll need an operation, e.g. $gdpr-delete to deal with a) the logic of whether one should do a hard delete or not (given local [EU country] legal requirements as to persistence of clinical data) and b) having to notify all third parties that have received a copy of your data that they should also erase the data, based on the AuditEvent record. It's a cascading process: if a citizen requests system A to delete item D, and A is aware the data has been sent/queried by application B, then A should call the $gdpr-delete operation on B. If B is aware it has made the information available to C, then B has to use $gdpr-delete on application C. <br>
We'll need to distinguish between a DELETE and a gdpr-delete, one can't and shouldn't assume that all DELETEs will be gdpr erasure requests.</p>

<p>Just want to revive this thread, the spec says "For servers that maintain a version history, the delete interaction does not remove a resource's version history. From a version history respect, deleting a resource is the equivalent of creating a special kind of history entry that has no content and is marked as deleted. Note that there is no support for deleting past versions - see notes on the history interaction."  in the delete section, I am wondering what is the rational behind not allowing deleting past versions? It feels to me that occasionally we'll need to delete some of the old versions.</p>

<p>I'm surprised at this statement in the FHIR specification. It seems we have discussed before that the actions taken on a Delete would be dependent on policy. That the FHIR specification simply indicates how a delete is communicated. The FHIR specification should not indicate the functionality. Where is this text specifically, which page?</p>

<p>I don't think we're making policy rules there. We don't say a server has to retain the history, just that the interaction is not understood to delete past versions</p>

<p>By the way, how do you like the idea that providing an API at the spec level to purge a specific resource and all its historical versions? A mechanism to handle the "right to be forgotten" case is critical to my team in short-term, and we probably need a solution before an official one lands in the spec. We thought about the patient central approach, i.e. remove all resources associated with a patient, and decided it was less ideal because the server cannot accommodate all possible purging logic, in addition, it is hard to maintain reference integrity from an implementation perspective.</p>

<p>Just to be sure: why do you want to delete all data from a patient? I ask because the right to be forgotten is not.absolute, and from a gdpr perspective I don't see an obvious case where one would hard delete all patient data.</p>

<p>So, although there are Medical Records retention requirements that will keep an EHR data safe... There are still other reasons to want a $deletePatient operation.<br>
1. First of all, the Medical Records retention period does have a sunset. Even if it is 100 years past death. At some point that Medical Records regulation reason to not Erase expires. At that time one MUST Erase the data. This is mandated by GDPR, when the data is no longer needed for the collection purpose it must be eliminated.<br>
2. the fact that FHIR is not limited to PurposeOfUse of Treatment... One might be using FHIR as a database to a Research project, and that project might have the patient come back and demand to be Erased.</p>

<p>Yes, the discussion always starts with calming them down with a reminder that GDPR Erase (and right to be forgotten) do not override other regulated reasons to maintain the data, such as Medical Records retention ...  but you must remind them that is a timeframe with a sunset, and after that sunset  the data must be erased. This is the big news to healthcare, as the data tends to NEVER be erased.</p>

<p>I suspect Grahame was referring to 'secondary records' as in use of FHIR that is not for "Treatment". This is commonly referred to as secondary use.</p>
<p>Yes, please suggest what you would like it to be. When someone suggests something, it tends to be what is chosen.  Yes, HL7 is a consensus organization, so the consensus might come up with different solution. This is almost always with good reason. Even a poorly written solution put into the ballot could result in a recognized R4 operation (at STU). However delay, and it becomes an R5 project.   Alternative is it becomes an IG with a path to core, which might be a good place for it to be developed. I am not sure what effort is involved for Security WG (my workgroup) to add a Draft level Operation. It seems it should not be too hard.

<p>FYI the HAPI operation is called <code>$expunge</code>. There is info on how it works here: <a href="https://smilecdr.com/docs/current/fhir_repository/deleting_data.html#the-expunge-operation" target="_blank" title="https://smilecdr.com/docs/current/fhir_repository/deleting_data.html#the-expunge-operation">https://smilecdr.com/docs/current/fhir_repository/deleting_data.html#the-expunge-operation</a> .. still need to backport the documentation into HAPI's doc set, but the operation works the same.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say that I'm proposing it for anything at this point.. We implemented it in response to a specific need that a group of HAPI FHIR users had.</p>
<p>It has some quirks for sure (it'll only delete up to N records, and N is capped to avoid overloading the database) and it will not expunge data that hasn't already (and separately) been deleted the normal way. Personally I think these are both good decisions but who knows...</p>

<p>I think for GDPR  like use-cases the verb $erase seems to be the logical verb for the operation. just because that is the verb used in GDPR. Else $forget, but that seems like a strange one... What kind of parameters? I think we are mostly here talking Patient, would that be too limiting? Or would that help clarity? There would certainly be STU experimentation needed around some of the fringe data, like data that is shared with another patient (mother/child).  There would need to be a declaration of who is responsible for checking that the operation should actually work, or not -- is it the caller or service that is responsible?... lots to STU expriment with</p>

<p>$erase is fairly non-ambiguous, and the wording does indeed fit with the gdpr. If &amp; when one needs to do a hard erase (and at some point in the lifecycle of the data one will have to do so), then such an operation makes sense.  </p>
<p>When one defines what the operation does, that's where the caveats are: if one has a resouce X (not a patient resource) referenced from the EHR of a patient P1, and it's also referenced from the EHR of a patient P2, then X should not be erased.  There may be meta flags on a resource which indicate 'used in ongoing legal proceedings' etc. These are the usual caveats well known in ILM and ECM in general. Note that HAPI's expunge operation doesn't extend to 'all data associated with patient resource P1', but just to 1 Patient resource P1, without following references, so the scope of the operation will have to clarified.</p>

<p>I don't think we should confuse $erase with a correction of an instance of data. Like found in the right to be forgotten, this can be just one report that is being 'forgotten'. Different from GDPR Erase all traces of an individual including that the individual even existed. Thus it would seem the first proposal for $erase would have one input parameter of the Patient to erase... this then can't be confused with more targeted corrections.   Right?</p>

<p>? - my question is whether one should design /Patient/1/$erase in such a way that it only erases Patient/1, or all resources part of the EHR of Patient/1 ? It all depends on whether one wishes the client or the server to have control over this.</p>

<p>and my response was... the operation is a request by a client to erase all record of that Patient... I say this because this is the GDPR need, and correction of some piece of data can be done with normal CRUD operations on that piece of data. Hence why it s an operation, rather than just a flavor of CRUD (Delete). As an operation it can also do all the softer (yet required) things. As an operation it might also execute site specific implementation such as de-identification rather than delete, or isolating some data needed by some other regulated action while removing visibility for the non-regulated uses... So, I am proposing the hard part be put into the service, not the client. That is my response to your question... Others can provide their response... you can reject my response. i is just a response</p>

<p>Elliot, the fact that some have found it useful to have an operation does not mean that ALL will find it useful. However if there is some critical set of need, that is what should drive the creation of the operation... The fact it is being discussed shows some interest. I don't think that this is critical evidence of need...  But enough need to discuss is a low bar... someone must still come forward with critical evidence of need, and that has not yet happened.</p>

<p>The Lables can carry purposeOfUse vocabulary, yes. When they do this, they are explicitly labeling that data as having been Gathered for that specific PurposeOfUse. More comonly it is understood that a whole FHIR Server is for a specific purposeOfUse, so there isn't redundant labeling. This voabulary can also be put on a Bundle to indicate that the data is being released for that set of PurposeOfUse... And a specific request to access data can carry a set of purposeOfUse to indicate that the intention of the request is to use the data for those purposes.</p>
