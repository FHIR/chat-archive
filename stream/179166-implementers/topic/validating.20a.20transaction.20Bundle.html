<p>I have a use case where I want to validate a transaction bundle by doing a <strong>POST baseDstu3/Bundle/$validate</strong>. The bundle includes some resources that should be created. One of the validation errors i'm getting as a response is:<br>
{<br>
    "severity": "error",<br>
    "code": "processing",<br>
    "diagnostics": "Bundle entry missing fullUrl",<br>
    "location": [ "Bundle.entry[0]", "Line 1, Col 36" ]<br>
  }</p>
<p>The STU3 spec says that the fullUrl of a Bundle entry must contain the "<em>Absolute URL for resource (server address, or UUID/OID)</em>". However, in this case some of the entries in the transaction bundle don't exist yet (they are of request type POST), and as I cannot tell the server what ID to use, there is no way for me to predict what the fullUrl should be.</p>
<p>Feels like this is a chicken/egg problem, where I want to validate my transaction before creating a set of (possible invalid) resources, but I can't validate the resources because they have not been created yet. Is there a way around this? Any help would be very much appreciated :)</p>

<p>You are right but that is specifically what the urn:uuid version of the reference is for. You just generate a random one, and put that in fullUrl and it whatever references that fullUrl. They act as placeholders, and get replaced by the actual server assigned ids.</p>
