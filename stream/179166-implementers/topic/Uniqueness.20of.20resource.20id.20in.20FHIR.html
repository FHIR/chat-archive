<p>I would like to clarify -- do I understand correctly that for any given resource type, all resources of that type within a given FHIR-compliant EHR database will have a unique id?<br>
Taking Condition as a concrete example: each Condition resource in Cerner's system must have a unique resource id; Condition id's are not necessarily guaranteed to be unique across different EHR's, but every other EHR system (e.g., Epic) should also have all of its Conditions with internally unique ids. Is that correct? Or can two Condition documents within the same EHR system have the same id?</p>

<p>Technically speaking these IDs are unique within a given resource type within a given fhir server. Keep in mind that systems vendors like Cerner or Epic may have thousands of customers with different FHIR endpoints, and "Patient/123" will be referring to a different patient in every one of those.</p>

<p>thank you for the response, I do realize it is a task with having different end points. Would changing the location of data be a good resolution to this? My strategy of going about this was to bulk load data into a DB(eventually implementing EDA) after translating the data from Json to Json LD, and then querying the data from the DB in graphQL.</p>

<p>It would seem, where there is a <strong>federation</strong> of FHIR servers, that the "original author" of a resource (ideally... the client that created it) should assign a GUID that is then faithfully persisted by the receiving server as the resource's id. In this way, content that is shared across the federation can be elegantly de-duped. I'm sure there is an intelligent role Provenance resources can play in this, too. As an example of why this could be important, collating content from a federation of FHIR servers into a patient-centric health summary document (e.g. IPS) is <em>very</em> difficult if id's are <em>not</em> globally unique. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192545">@Alex Goel</span></p>

<p>the id is a unique identifier "within the assigning authority", which is the root url of the FHIR server. You can not, and must not, presume that the same id means the data are the same. You must have the same id and the same root url. -- True even if using GUID.</p>

<p>I'm not trying to sound stoopid, but that <em>wouldn't</em> be true if it was really a GUID... would it? The goal of the approach I was describing was to avoid the proliferation of uniquely identified resources in cases where there is a federation of FHIR servers, and the same content may be found on multiple servers. There are use cases where this proliferation can become very problematic. Creating a globally unique id, once, and faithfully persisting it every time a resource is copied from one server to another, can fundamentally simplify workflows that otherwise can become intractably hard.</p>

<p>well, that's very often the case, but the information was acquired on channels that don't automatically trace identity (e.g. paper form, verbal, etc) and so it might be the same content but it won't have the same identifier. </p>
<p>Sometimes you're in luck, and there is traceability, and it's reliable even in the face of institutional record keeping policies. And then, if all the ducks stand nicely in the row, the GUID approach really pays off. Bang - you can shoot all ducks with a single shot, and you get the prize</p>

<p>in the absence of a GUID approach... someone's going to have a mapping table somewhere, and maintaining it is somwhat expensive. Only, in my experience, what's damned expensive is maintaining integrity in the face of institutional record "correction" policies, and then it turns out you need mapping tables anyway, even if everyone started with the same guid. </p>
<p>oh the stories I can tell! (but anyone who's worked in a reasonably large health institution has their own stories)</p>

<p>It's true... sometimes we get lucky. But if we're electronically sharing data, and we persist a golden thread (the GUID) when we do, then at least in that case we'll be able to elegantly get our ducks in a row. "Luck favours the prepared"... as they say. ;-)</p>

<p>GUID does not have absolute guarantee of never having two identical values ever created. Yes the chances are impossibly high, but they do exist. Within one FHIR server that chance is addressed by the create operation noticing that the GUID that it created happens to already exist in the database, so another GUID is created. Thus one can only be sure that GUID is unique within one FHIR server. (Note the FHIR server does need to have been created with good systems-design principles, one I just mentioned).</p>

<p>Sorry... but I don't believe I am making a rash assumption when I assume that GUID means <em>globally</em> unique ID. There is a mature standard for how these are to be created and this spec must be followed for the resulting artefacts to <strong>actually</strong> be considered GUIDs. RE: para-3 of sec-6... I'm sure that was good advice in 2005 (and it still is one way to go)... and I'm equally sure there are GUIDs being reliably generated all day, every day, all over.  The issue at hand is that there is a <strong>FHIR resource id proliferation problem</strong> in federated server environments, and GUIDs are one way to address this issue. I'm sure there are other ways, too...</p>

<p>It seems to me that this discussion has degenerated into trying to apply a business meaning to a purely technical element. Whether a resource id is globally unique or not, the moment a resource is instantiated on a different FHIR server it becomes a different instance. If there is a business need to establish that two instances of a resource contain information about the same business entity (same patient, same result, etc.), then you must use an identifier for that purpose. Anything else is fraught with risks.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the issue of federated FHIR servers is not important or easy to solve - on the contrary. I am just pointing out that <a href="http://Resource.id">Resource.id</a> is not the way to solve it.</p>

<p>If it is a copy... is it not useful that this copy will have the same GUID as the "original"? So may things we need to do with FHIR resources are operationalized by referencing the id. Across a federation of FHIR servers, the very chatty process of searching and fetching by identifier... then by id (once the server-assigned <a href="http://patient.id">patient.id</a> is known, for example)... seems ripe for being re-engineered. I live in hope for a better way...</p>

<p>no.<br>
As Vassil indicates the copy can/should/shall have a .identifier that holds the original resource .id and system. But that copy is a copy and takes on a life of its-own. Most copies should/shall/may never change, but they are still copies that have a life of their own.<br>
also, a Provenance is really good to have to show the derivation.</p>

<p>There are some very important issues that need to be solved. The very <em>unhelpful behaviour</em> of a federation of FHIR servers -- that are all assigning different id's to the identical copies they may have of a single resource -- is one of these important issues. I fear that the idea of saving the original .id in an .identifier element will be a very poor performer, in practice (just too chatty... a simple sequence diagram of the traffic pattern illustrates this). Has anyone tried to address "proliferation of duplicate resources across a federation of FHIR servers" problem... and found a good solution?</p>

<p>A lot of EHRs require you to first undertake patient resolution (which will give you a <a href="http://Patient.id">Patient.id</a>) and then get authorization and perform all other queries using <a href="http://Patient.id">Patient.id</a>.

<p>WRT to IPS requests - identifier is one of the input parameters to the nascent $summary operation.  I also believe that it will be one of the primary means of facilitating searching from patient-facing apps.</p>
<p>In NZ, we have 30 years experience of using a national patient identifier (NHI) in EHR systems and HIE services. Based on that experience, I strongly recommend implementers here NOT to use it as the ID of a Patient Resource however convenient that may be for them in the short-term - for the same reasons that it is not a suitable candidate for a primary key in a relational database.</p>
