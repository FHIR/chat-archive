<p>Hi<br>
After some advice of how people have modelled status changes on infusion items ? (if anyone has?)<br>
An infusion item is a one where each dose (typically an injectable liquid) is administered to a patient over an extended period of time.  Only when the infusion is ended is the event considered to be finished.  This is unlike other common administrations, such as for oral tablets where the event is considered as and finished (and started as a single action) immediately as the dose is swallowed.  Generally infusions can be distinctly recorded as begun and then completed as two separate actions with separate timestamps.  In addition there are various other actions that are supported, such as change of infusion rate, pause infusion, resume infusion,  complete infusion.</p>
<p>We would like to record these changes and are thinking about using the PartOf element to capture this</p>

<p>Has anyone else had to model something similar/used part Of within Med Admin ?</p>

<p>Normally each adjustment is treated as a distinct MedicationAdministration.  I.e. There'd be one 'administration' from start to rate change, one from rate change to on-hold, and one from off-hold to completion.  If you wanted to group them, I guess you could - with no details about rate.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="401745">@Leonie Bedford</span> yes, IHE MMA has done that analysis some time ago</p>

<p>starting from point-in time administrations, to more interesting change of flow rate, change in saline bags, etc.</p>

<p>The approach taken is like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> suggests - you can send the detailed administration intervals as well as a overall administration.  The details contain lot numbers, detailed rates, etc. The overall administration (of which the others are a partOf) contains a summary (total amount administered, start time, end time)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="401745">@Leonie Bedford</span> IHE is going to republish this as a proper FHIR IG, and I would be happy to hear feedback</p>
