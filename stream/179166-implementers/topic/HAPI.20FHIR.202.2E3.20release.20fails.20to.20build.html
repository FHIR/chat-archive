<p>I am doing a mvn clean install and it fails on the build of project hapi-fhir-structures-dstu2.1: The failure reason is something pathetically sick<br>
 Cannot run program "javac" (in directory "E:\hapi-fhir-2.3\hapi-fhir-structures-dstu2.1"): CreateProcess error=2, The system cannot find the file specified<br>
which makes no sense since 10 previous projects were built. However, the HELP 1 points to an error in the configuration of a plugin in the pom file. That also makes no sense given this a release. Any ideas?</p>
