<p>Is there a FHIR resource that is used for Screening Due Dates?</p>
<p>My use case is that I am using a population health vendor to integrate with my company's EHR. They will ingest FHIR resources that contain things like procedures, diagnoses, etc.</p>
<p>They will be generating screening due dates, based on existing quality measure requirements, and then they will get those due dates back to us. We would then want to display these in our EHR, either in a physician's panel or for a regional care manager.</p>
<p>Is there a FHIR resource we should consider using for the vendor to transmit screening due dates back to us?</p>
<p>I suspect this is an item that lives outside of FHIR, but wanted to see if anyone had worked on population health and found a FHIR resource for this.</p>

<p>I am looking at a similar use case for preventive care screening alerts and considering how the Gaps in Care IG (<a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-deqm/gaps-in-care-reporting.html">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-deqm/gaps-in-care-reporting.html</a>) could be used.  Where DetectedIssue is the care gap with dates.  Although, my use case does not include MeasureReport and could identify gaps via CDS implemented using CQL.</p>

<p>My general leaning would be either CarePlan or ServiceRequest instances with an intent of 'plan' - where you're trying to say "this is when this future screening should happen"</p>
