<p>Hi! The FHIR documentation clearly states that if there are multiple relatedActions inside a PlanDefinition.action, they are treated as AND statements, i.e. all relatedActions must be fulfilled. I am, however, in need of specifying the OR case, i.e. several different paths in a PlanDefinition that lead to one single action X. So I would like to specify that X takes place after action A or B or C etc.</p>
<p>Does anyone have experience doing this? It can of course be done using an extension, but I didn't find an "official" one, which surprised me since I thought it would be a popular thing. So perhaps there is some smarter way of doing it?</p>

<p>action.selectionBehavior lets you indicate whether all of them are done, only one, at least one, etc.</p>

<p>Aha! I was looking at that field, but since the description says "Defines the selection behavior for the action and its children", I got to thinking this was somehow reserved for actions that are defined in a tree structure. I just have a flat list of actions, [X, A, B, C, ...] and I declaratively define their mutual dependencies with relatedAction, i.e. X comes after A etc.</p>
<p>I'll look into using selectionBehavior, thanks!</p>
