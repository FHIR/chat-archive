<p>I think that you could use the NutritionOrder for this.  Infant Formula is covered in the enteralFormula section.  Breast Milk would be an Oral Diet with the type set to 'breast milk'  - although I think that a ticket could be raised to change type to a choice of a code or a set of NutritionProducts.  TPN is explicitly out-of-scope of the NutritionOrder, so that would be something else.</p>

<p>NutritionOrder does work for diet, it is specific administration or defining what the infant ate (i.e., is the nutrition order fulfilled or is something else given.  That is the use case. I can let the measure developer speak to the issue as well.  They should be signing on.</p>

<p>thank you Jose - that is the issue.  My understanding is that there might be two ways for data entry of administration - (1) in the Neonatal ICU (NICU), the breast milk might be bar coded and administration occurs using the medication administration app, or (2) intake is recorded on the intake and output record, but not necessarily in structured format.  So there may be a feasibility issue in determining exactly what was included in the infant's intake (e.g., sterile water, breast milk, formula, etc.).  But there is currently no clear way to identify such intake with FHIR resources unless someone can help to direct us.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192672">@Floyd Eisenberg</span>  - do you also need to differentiate mother's milk from donor's milk?   If so, not sure how that would be represented in the MedAdmin.   (and yes, there also needs to be the totaling of all these fluids/nutritions to keep track of the baby's net fluid balance, besides the nutritional aspects of what they consume.   There may also be additional nutrients added as well.)</p>

<p>Thanks for the question. From the perspective of this particular measure, the intent is to know that breast milk only was administered in lieu of all other intake (including sterile water, formula, etc.).  I’m not sure if donor milk is allowable and will check with the measure developer. For a more generic sense, yes, all intake and totaling of all fluids/nutrients would be needed as well as fluid output (generally measured in we diapers though).</p>

<p>Nutrition SMEs concur that there is currently not an ideal way to record food or formula administration/intake using existing FHIR resources.  Enteral <br>
 (tube feeding volume) administration has same issue.  Both are most typically recorded in nursing I/Os flowsheets. When last we brought forth some similar use cases, folks pointed us toward using Observation (and working to develop a profile) as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> suggests.   </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191507">@Antonio De Nigro</span>  perhaps you could comment on the challenges you had using this in your recent nutrition food record work?  We have an interested group starting calls to work on these gaps.

As a developer, if I am giving a product to a paitent, it may be hard enough to decide between MedAdministration and (a hypothetical) NutritionAdministration just because they may be classified differently in my hospital.

<p>Same applies for administration statement - whatever we do, it should be somehow consistent between drugs and other products (what is the difference anyway?)</p>

<p>my take is that we do need a resource to capture xxxAdministration, and xxxStatement, but the boundaries between those should be very clear (Pharmacy paved the way, and their boundaries are quite good IMO - not perfect yet, but "implementable" good)</p>

<p>Just looked at the V2 Chapter 4  -- it describes how to handle Order/Dispense/Give/Administer not only pharmacy products but TPN (and other nutritional IVs), vaccines, and blood products.   So, to Jose's point, there may need to be some common pattern in FHIR to do something similar, i.e. handling of all kinds of ordered/dispensed/administered 'things' (V2 calls them 'treatments' since even things like PT, OT and such can be ordered and administered.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192672">@Floyd Eisenberg</span> Thanks, Floyd, that is the issue with NutritionOrder. For the quality measure, we want to know exactly what the patient received, not just what was ordered.</p>

<p>Thanks for the question. From the perspective of this particular measure, the intent is to know that breast milk only was administered in lieu of all other intake (including sterile water, formula, etc.).  I’m not sure if donor milk is allowable and will check with the measure developer. For a more generic sense, yes, all intake and totaling of all fluids/nutrients would be needed as well as fluid output (generally measured in we diapers though).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> I agree.  Apps trying to compute total intake for fluids or nutrients (e.g. Calorie Count, etc) will benefit from a dedicated resource.  The OO Nutrition group can bring forward a new resource proposal for NutritionStatement and Nutrition(Product)Administration starting from what works well with these in Medication resources.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193259">@Margaret Dittloff</span>  - Sounds good.  It also sounds like there is a common pattern that maybe fits with the order workflow pattern that encompasses not only the order but the 'downstream states' of the actions/events and results of the order.  (I guess this is already in the Workflow pattern though there isn't a 'Nutrition Admin' or a 'Vaccine Admin' or a 'Blood Product Admin' if these specializations are needed?)</p>

<p>Both this possible pattern, and the need for new resources is what the OO group is discussing in the Health Product calls. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191689">@Hans Buitendijk</span>  is conducting the works</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193259">@Margaret Dittloff</span>  Any news on this subject? We're currently trying to find resources which could represent the feeding pattern of an infant.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="215518">@Sebastiaan Raap</span> Yes, the nutrition sub-group for OO is working to bring forward a new resource proposal for NutritionIntake (exact naming TBD).  This group is meeting weekly on Fridays 2 PM ET, except not during WGM.  We are gathering use cases for patient reported food/meal intake, clinician reported (like a 24-hour recall or food freq. assessment by the dietitian) as well as  administration of formula (which includes infant/pediatric formula or breastmilk fed orally or via tube) and adult enteral (tube feed),  We will definitely review your use cases and add pointers to your examples.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197951">@Becky Gradl</span>  who is leading this project can chime in with more details .</p>
