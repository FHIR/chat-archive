<p>Coverage allows you to indicate both the policyHolder, subscriber and beneficiary.  That's generally as deep as a hierarchy gets.  Beneficiaries need to have a relationship to the subscriber.  Individuals with relationships to beneficiaries don't really matter - it's the relationship to the subscriber that counts.  If you query all Coverages for a given subscriber, you can find the collection of covered individuals.</p>
