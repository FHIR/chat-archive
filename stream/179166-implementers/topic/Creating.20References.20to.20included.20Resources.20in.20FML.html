<p>I'm mapping a source document to a Bundle and I am trying to figure out how I can both create a resource as a Bundle.entry.resource and create a reference to that same resource later on in my mapping rules.  I may be missing something but I see no way to create the resource in one rule, determine a reference to that resource and use that reference in another rule.</p>

<ul>
<li>to determine the reference: reference(var). or you can just populate it from the variable</li>
<li>the elsewhere part: you have to pass things along as references; there's no other way to pass things around, since the mapping language is not procedural</li>
</ul>
