<p>I am looking for a Provider Directory.  We want to be able to search for a provider by specialty, healthcare organization, NPI, first, last, ... for purposes of Referral and Admissions.  What are people using?</p>

<p>hi Grahame.  I just looked at the provider directory on Argonaut.  Is it implemented by anyone and if so,  what are they using for the data?  Their own healthcare provider data, or are they fronting something like this <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/registry/" target="_blank" title="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/registry/">https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/registry/</a>? with a FHIR facade.</p>

<p>This is an active group at the moment. There are some doing this as a centralized installation (such as the Michigan Health Information Network) and there are also products (like Epic/Cerner/Surescript/others) that are exposing their internal directory data for this purpose.<br>
The ONC also has a community working on developing the use cases in this space and fostering the wider community to be collaborative here. There has been discussions in this context on potentially exposing NPI/NPPES as a FHIR service, but nothing at present.</p>

(Important to note that it is no longer being called a provider directory but a Healthcare directory, as it is not just providers that are exposed via the direcory - recognising the importance of services and supporting health activies, not just a list of providers)</p>

<p>The discussion in IHE is just starting in the ITI committee where prior directory work was done. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191646">@Eric Heflin</span>  proposed it as a work item for 2017.  We just finished the prioritization phase, for which this proposal got high priority. Next week we assess resource availability. The expectation is NOT to compete, but be a place where the good work can be promulgated and maintained. Eric assured us that he and others will do this coordination to assure alignment and separation of responsibilities. </p>

<p>These will belong in either the Practitioner.Identifier or Practitioner.Role.Identifier (or the new PractitionerRole resource) depending on if the identifier is unique to the practitioner, or the practitioner at a specific location/role.<br>
Licenses could be stored in the practitioner qualification.identifiers, as these are not typically location specific, and do not necessarily mean that the practitioner can perform services they have a license for at all locations they work. (As may not be employed for those services ).</p>

<p>California State Bill (SB) 137 requires providers must share specific attributes on each practitioner (see <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB137" target="_blank" title="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB137">https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB137</a> ) - some of these (e.g. whether a practitioner is accepting new patients, insurance plans they accept, specifics of their licenses, i.e. licensing state, license number, what hospital admitting privileges they have, etc) are not explicitly defined as attributes in Practitioner resource.

<p>As a follow up to separate chats I had with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191430">@Paul Knapp</span>  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191367">@Brian Postlethwaite</span> during San Antonio Connectathon : What are some practical ways to associate a Practitioner resource with insurance plans they accept? </p>
<p>Currently there isn't a resource that represents an insurance plan. There is Coverage, but it is specific to a Patient. We need a way to represent that a Practitioner takes Blue Cross Blue Shield's plan X, Y, and Z,  Aetna's plan A and B, and so on. A common use case is that a patient would want to search for practitioners that have a particular specialty, accept the patient's insurance plan, and are located nearby (within X miles) of where the patient lives. </p>
<p>Lloyd suggested we can perhaps use the Contract resource to represent insurance plans accepted by an Organization (so any Practitioner providing service under that Organization is assumed to accept such plans). However, an Insurance plan isn't really a contract, and at the same time, I'm not sure if this is enough to require creating a new resource to represent Insurance plans. </p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>What kind of metadata is necessary to describe these insurance plans well enough to search? I agree that Contract is not likely the right object. Might be a useful reason to create a new Resource type.</p>

<p>Well, you don't actually want the "plan", you want the agreement between an organization and an insurer that the organization will offer services under the plan and the insurer will cover services delivered under the plan by that organization.  Which is sort of contract-like.  The plan itself would presumably just be referenced by identifier/code</p>

<p>I agree with Lloyd, it's an agreement between an insurer and a praticioner in a organisation. A practicioner could work in different organisations (eg hospital, and his own doctors office.) with different agreements with different insurers. </p>

<p>Thanks John, Lloyd, and Patrick. </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  -  to represent an insurance plan, we'd at least need 2 attributes - 1. organization that provides the plan (e.g. Kaisier, Bluecross Blueshield,Cigna, etc.); and 2. the organization-specific name of the plan (e.g. Bronze 60 HMO, Gold PPO, etc.). </p>
<p>With your suggested structure, separate Contract resources will need to represent a provider organization's agreement with Kaiser, Cigna, etc. respectively (each also defined as a Organization), and within each Contract, use an attribute like valueItem.entity to represent the different insurance plan names? Actually then the names of the plans will need to be defined as a CodeableConcept, which is good, because then the Practitioner search parameters can reference the same CodebleConcept. Does this approach make sense?</p>
<p>I'm sure definition of an insurance plan requires other attributes to, like plan start/end date (valid for), geographic areas covered, plan type (HMO vs PPO, etc.), and cost attributes such as yearly deductible, OOP max,  etc. for individual/family (although our use case to search for a provider by insurance plan they accept doesn't need these).  I suspect that for these latter attributes, we may need to consider a separate InsurancePlan type resource. </p>

<p>I dont think a contract s the correct resource either. Its some simple searching attributes that I think belong with the organization. This could be a valid use for the upcoming orgassociation resource. But there is nothing there today specifically for it.<br>
Valid usecase that we do plan to cover, and we will work on this soon - happy to have the implementer to assist directly.<br>

<p>Any updates on Provider Directory by the community?  Just posted a thread over on the IHE Stream - to the same effect.  Where is Provider Directory IG, Profiles, etc work currently being done?  We are working with the HL7 FHIR Connectathon Track Leadds for Scheduling - who use case incorporates Provider Directory.  If we can get updated Provider Directory efforts publically accessible and reviewed prior to Sept - we can work on updates, and rolling out any new Test Scripts to support Provider Directory.  We want to support both FHIR PD Consumer, and PD Host services.</p>

<p>Thanks Stefan... correct -- I responded to Mario over on the IHE thread (he is making me feel like a dog chasing my tail) --- That would be for the 'classic' for for HPD. I presume you are interested in the FHIR form for HPD -- which is renamed "Mobile Care Services Discovery" (mCSD). This rename because for the FHIR form we combined CSD and HPD; the CSD editors showed up to the face-to-face meeting, and thus they got to pick the name of the combined profile.. :-) The public comment form is at <a href="http://www.ihe.net/Public_Comment/#IT" target="_blank" title="http://www.ihe.net/Public_Comment/#IT">http://www.ihe.net/Public_Comment/#IT</a></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191380">@Elliot Silver</span> I realize that efforts are underway with IHE, and similarily there have been work products and efforts underway with HSPC, Argonauts and the large FHIR Community.  There have been a few HL7 FHIR Connectathons which have focused on PD as part of another test track Scheduling.  Ensuring we capture the correct use cases, it should be easy for these groups to review how the IHE draft standard would apply to their efforts.  While IHE references the FHIR Resources, do you know if any work is currently underway to constrain the HL7 FHIR Resources with FHIR Profiles?  Currently, many are leveraging Furore Simplifier and Forge tools (see <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191336">@Michel Rutten</span> for further information) - while <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191370">@Richard Ettema</span> and AEGIS work to create FHIR Test Scripts to test FHIR implementations.</p>

<p>At this time, the IHE documentation process does not use Structure Definition, CapabilityStatement, or ImplmentationGuide. We're aware of Simplifier and Forge, and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191336">@Michel Rutten</span> did a great presentation of them for the IHE. I would like to see that change, but it is going to take some work to get there. The more people we have in committees who are willing to do the work, the quicker we can switch. Trust me, we are aware of this gap.<br>
A more immediate concern for me is getting feedback on whether mCSD is compatible with the other provider directory efforts.   We'd hoped to get committe feedback on that, but it doesn't appear to have been done. I'd be grateful if someone with knowledge of the other directory efforts was able to provide input, in whatever form.</p>

<p>Hello, and thanks for your collective work on FHIR. I have been watching from the sidelines with enthusiasm. I have some comments on the Provider Directory standard here: <a href="http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/pd/" target="_blank" title="http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/pd/">http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/pd/</a> I am. currently trying to reconcile the real-world role of NPPES and this standard. And part of the problem with this is that the use cases listed on that page for provider directory are, not actually use cases, but functions. Use cases typically include the reasons why someone needs a functionality, as well as documenting the functionality. The functionality listed there could be summarized as "search for and get provider data". But full use cases should include. "transmit the data required to enable finding provider data in order to support the routing of healthcare data to them" and "transmit data needed for determining the appropriateness/credentials/specialty and availability of a provider for a potential patient referral" or "transmit the data that allows patients to find doctors in order to make appointments" and "providing data for researchers to be able to study providers".  Those are the reasons that search is necessary and should be included in the use cases on those page.  Without those it is impossible to determine if NPPES should be a compliant provider directory because the "real" reasons that an HL7 FHIR Provider Directory should exist are not actually listed. Is this something that can be easily corrected? These concepts are included in the discussions from the 2016 provider directory workshop as well as use cases outlined in the IHE provider directory specification... so I hope that it is reasonable to surface these. Frankly it would be enough to add the sentence "the purpose of the provider directory is to facilitate further interoperability efforts and the study thereof". But it even missing something that high-level.</p>

<p>Ok, next question. I have credentials that I have found in NPPES that are not found in the current credential list. <br>
<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0360/2.7/index.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0360/2.7/index.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0360/2.7/index.html</a><br>
and <br>
<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0360/2.7/v2-0360-2.7.cs.json.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0360/2.7/v2-0360-2.7.cs.json.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0360/2.7/v2-0360-2.7.cs.json.html</a><br>
Also, the current credential list lacks any url to the manager of the credential. For instance, a CHT - Certified Hand Therapists is a credential that can only be obtained through the The Hand Therapy Certification Commission at <a href="http://www.htcc.org/" target="_blank" title="http://www.htcc.org/">http://www.htcc.org/</a> So it should be possible for someone to validate that credential through that organization. In fact, assuming credentialing is in scope, when a given credential is associated with one and only one source, we should be linking to that source, to facilitate the credentialing process. Eventually, those sources should have provider directories of their own, so that they can automate the credentialing process. But at least linking to them seems prudent. There are some credentials like 'MD' and 'DO' that are verified by specific schools attended... and can even be acquired internationally, so there is no "single source of truth" but it does seem like if there is a "single source of truth" we should list it, especially if we want them to have provider directories eventually. I want to propose 1 that we add all of the credentials that are "in the wild" in NPPES 2. that we add the fields "is_credential_single_sourced (true/false)" and "credential owner name" and "credential owner url" and "credential owner provider directory url" to this data structure. How, where and to whom do I make that proposal?</p>

<p>You are 100% right there. And one of the areas that will need further profiling during the next stage of the VhDir guide with the US specific credential providers etc. I was wondering who would be the appropriate registrar of these things, ONC, HHS, CMS, HL7? (the credential providers, not the identifier/qualification values)<br>
In Australia we've started doing that in the au-base IG.<br>
So could be another alternative to put these in US-Core and link into the VhDir IG, as these values are going to be used outside the directory too.</p>

There is a <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PA/Connectathon+Jan+2019+at+WGM" target="_blank" title="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PA/Connectathon+Jan+2019+at+WGM">Connectathon Jan 2019 at WGM</a> , but is there a guidance/tool on how to load IG and sample data to the FHIR Server?</p>

<p>given that this is an international problem, and that we do need to support cases where healthcare providers are switching countries and given that HL7 is the only international body on your list, I suppose that it makes sense that HL7 should ultimately own the "master list". <br>
In the short term tho.. I think we should be adding a "country_jurisdiction" to the fields I just suggested in order to create a two-level namespace. I expect that M.D. etc probably can be verified by a single source in many countries and so it makes sense to use an appropriate country code there, in addition to the other values. While this seems like overkill, I expect that the assertion that "this Dr obtained their MD in spain" is exactly the type of long term benifits that the provider directory should be able to support... </p>
<p>But I still do not know how I go about getting new columns and new rows added this file that is being used today. How do I get that done?</p>

<p>HL7 doesn't own <em>any</em> list of provider information.  We define standards for sharing information via registries.  We don't maintain a provider registry of our own and (to my knowledge), have no intention of doing so.</p>

<p>Sorry to be unclear, but I was not talking about lists of providers (although there do appear to be lots of them in the OID registry, so I am unclear what you mean when you say there is no list of providers..). but I am instead discussing lists of provider credentials, which lives here: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0360/2.7/index.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0360/2.7/index.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0360/2.7/index.html</a></p>

<p>@Fred and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191367">@Brian Postlethwaite</span> the list Fred's link refers to is provider degrees, which generally lead to licensure. Additional certifications, e.g. the hand therapy certification noted earlier in the thread, is a different kind of credential and I would be careful not to lump actual educational degrees leading to licensure with other, non-degree certifications or certifications that are in addition to the degree or license. Depending on the type of certification, having one will not by itself enable an individual to practice without having a degree and license first.</p>

<p>Hello dear colleagues, same as a time at birth, this same question keeps coming back: Provider Directory. IHE mCSD/ILR, VHDir or Argonaut? What is the difference? Which one to use to build or is there anything to re-use/upgrade? I think I am missing something important here and hope for help from the collective experience, please.</p>
