<p>I have not worked FHIR server side so a bit of a newbie.  How do you apply the artifacts contained in an Implementation Guide to your server.  I can see where I may POST different items as resources, but that doesn't feel like a best practice.  Is there a good reference for how to consume IGs into a server?</p>

<p>Hi Sean - I moved your question to a different thread, as the one it was posted under wasn't really related to the question.</p>
<p>What do you mean by "apply the artifacts to your server"?  Are you just wanting to validate your instances against an IG's profiles, or are you looking for something else?</p>

<p>Hi! I have the same question. In my case, I already have created FHIR Profiles for our system. I'm also currently working on our IG. I was able to install and try out HAPI-FHIR in the past, but I believe this instance utilizes the base FHIR resources. I guess our concern here is that, now that we have FHIR profiles, how will we be able to implement/import these into a FHIR server, for example a HAPI-FHIR instance? Are there any resources we can check out for this procedure? Thank you very much!</p>

<ul>
<li>the HAPI server validates incoming resources against the profiles</li>
<li>the HAPI server implements all the functionality described in the IG</li>
<li>the HAPI server has all the examples from the IG in it</li>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> ,  thank you for responding. I'm kinda new to this so I don't really know if I'm missing something. But the idea I have in mind is to have the HAPI server accept data, validate it against our custom FHIR profiles, then store it in the database. Then also allow clients to fetch, search, edit, delete data (typical FHIR functions). When it comes to your question, I think the second one's closer to what I want to do.</p>

<p>There is no ability to have a server magically implement everything that an implementation guide describes.  Messaging interfaces, custom operations, security protocols, anything described in free text will all need to be hand-coded or otherwise configured into the behavior of the server.  You certainly <em>can</em> make the code systems, value sets, profiles, etc. that are defined by the IG available to the server to use in validation, however you'd still have to set rules about when to invoke that validation - do you expect all of your inbound instances to be valid against specific profiles?  Only instances from certain places?  Only validate if the instance declares conformance with the profile (which you generally shouldn't count on)?</p>

<p>Everything except the last would generally also require code to be written to trigger the validation.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="441341">@Nelo Aguila</span> you are asking for the HAPI server to validate incoming data against an IG. I believe that there's a simple way to do this, but you will probably get a better answer on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179167" href="/#narrow/stream/179167-hapi">#hapi</a></p>
