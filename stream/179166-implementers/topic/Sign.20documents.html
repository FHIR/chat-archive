<p>Communication lets you say "I shared" or "here you are".  CommunicationRequest lets you say "Please share".  Both really only deal with "The recipient received this information" - there's nothing about signing or taking any other sort of action.  If you want that, you want Task because it lets you specify what you want done.  (It also provides for the possibility of the recipient marking the Task as "done" and providing back the result.</p>

<p>The Provenance resource is used when one wants to sign a bunch of Resources (may be a bundle, but might just be a bunch). There would be one Provenance that points at all the things to be signed (Provenance.target), and the signature would be carried in Provenance.signature. There is known issues around digital signatures, however if you have a Document you avoid them by signing the Document Bundle where everything is included. The Provenance.signature would explain 'why' the signature exists.</p>
