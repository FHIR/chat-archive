<p>Hi! We at Kry/Livi are trying to model our "clinician notes" from a meeting with a GP in FHIR. In our case, clinician notes contain things like "reason for seeking care", different fields relating to anamnesis (e.g. previous diseases, allergies etc) and possible diagnosis codes. So from a SOAP perspective I guess it contains not only A but also some of S and O.</p>
<p>After looking through the available resources in FHIR, we found the ClinicalImpression seemed like the most suitable Resource, where we can put a lot of information under the <code>investigation</code> field, some as specific FHIR Resources (e.g. Allergies) but most of them as generic Observations.<br>
I have looked through the Confluence page to try to get a better understanding, but the links to the storyboards unfortunately seem broken: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PC/Clinical+Assessment">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PC/Clinical+Assessment</a>. I also notice that the Resource is currently in Draft (FMM 0), but no updates seem to have happened since in the past few years.</p>
<p>So my current questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are we using the Resource as intended, or is there a more suitable resource(s) that we have missed?</li>
<li>We noticed in <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/ClinicalImpression.20Evidence/near/227697653">another message</a> that the investigation element has been merged with the “supporting info”-field in R5. Are there any more changes discussed for R5? Is there a centralized place, mailing list, or suitable substream here in Zulip where we can receive updates regarding this Resource? As one of Europe's biggest digital GP practices we might be able to offer some valuable input towards future developments of the Resource.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a broad category of Clinical Documents, a Clinical Note might be assembled using various Resources, such as Bundle, Compositon and Observations etc.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="364617">@Cristian Osorio Bretti</span> Those are good questions, and a good offer, which I think should help as we have further discussion on this resource in the Patient Care WG (and you're right, there hasn't been much of that happening over at least the past couple of years, but we've recently started to bring it up again and hopefully can move it forward).  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191403">@Michelle (Moseman) Miller</span>?</p>

<p>So a follow up question re. this topic. We currently want to store our "primary" and "secondary" diagnosis. The field "finding" seems relevant, but how do we encode the primary vs secondary part? What is the correct FHIR way to do this? Could you imply this relationship by using order of the list, i.e. primary diagnosis first? Another idea was to put "primary" in itemCodeableConcept and the actual diagnosis in "itemReference", but this feels wrong to me. I would expect itemCodeableConcept or itemReference to be populated, not both?</p>

<p>At least, LOINC Codes for such diagnoses and the Observation resource could be used to do it.</p>

<p>Ah, I see that LOINC has <code>Primary diagnosis</code>, thanks. But does it make sense to set <code>itemCodeableConcept</code> to this value and the <code>itemReference</code> to the actual value (say an ICD-10 code). I would interpret the standard as you can use either CodeableConcept <em>or</em> Reference to define a Finding. Now we are somehow using them together but meaning different things, with one as the actual value and one as a qualifier. Is this really ok?</p>

<p>Typically the notion of 'primary' vs. 'secondary' apply to the context of a Claim or an Encounter - they're not something that's intrinsic to the Condition itself.  (A Condition that's 'primary' for one Claim might be 'secondary' for another.)  Encounter and Claim both allow the Observations and Conditions they reference to be ordered by rank.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to respond. When you say that they allow the "references to be ordered by rank", how would I do this in practice?</p>

<p>Thanks for both of your replies Michele and Lloyd! I have now solved it using a contained Encounter, which in turns references two contained Conditions, hehe. Would it make sense to have a an optional <code>rank</code> field for <code>ClinicalImpression.finding</code>?</p>

<p>Not sure why you'd make them 'contained' - you're saying that these conditions are only meaningful and only have existence in the context of a particular encounter?</p>
<p>What would 'rank' mean in the case of a ClinicalImpression?  What behavior would it drive?</p>
