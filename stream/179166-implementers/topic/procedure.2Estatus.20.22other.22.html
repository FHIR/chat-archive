<p>For the value set event-status used for procedure.status, there is a code unknown. In the definition of unknown, it says: “Note: This concept is not to be used for "other" - one of the listed statuses is presumed to apply, but the authoring/source system does not know which.”</p>
<p>Does this imply that there is a way to handle “other”? I have a client who is interpreting this to mean that there is a way to handle other.</p>
<p>Here is one example of what they are trying to solve:</p>
<p>If the user system defined “contraindicated” , and we do not know which one to put this as procedure.status, how do you define other in standard value set required?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!<br>
Rob</p>

<p>Thanks for the specific example; this helps a lot in the analysis, and probably gives you a better sense of how to handle the general case too.</p>
<p>"Contraindicated" isn't really a valid kind of status for a procedure -- but it's a very useful statusReason (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/procedure-definitions.html#Procedure.statusReason">http://hl7.org/fhir/procedure-definitions.html#Procedure.statusReason</a>). This might be accompanied by a status like <code>not-done</code> to indicate that the procedure wasn't performed because of a contraindication. Or if the procedure was possibly performed despite the but you  aren't actually sure..  then in that case you could use status <code>unknown</code> -- but you would especially want to populate the reason in this case.</p>

<p>You could also have a ServiceRequest with do-not-perform set to 'true' if you're wanting to say "please don't do this" as opposed to "I opted to not do this".</p>

<p>Thanks Josh and Lloyd! That gives me some options.</p>
