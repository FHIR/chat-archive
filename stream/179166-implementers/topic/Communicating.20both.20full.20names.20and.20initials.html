<p>Suppose I have a name of a person where I have a single given name in full ("Janni") and multiple initials ("J. P. M."). Furthermore, suppose that I formally don't know the relation between the two (I could guess of course, but I don't <em>know</em>).</p>
<p>I would probably need two HumanName instances to communicate the full set of information, one for the full name(s) and one for the initials -- if I would use a single instance, I wouldn't know if I should replace the "J." with "Janni".</p>
<p>Would I then need to include the _full_ name in both instances, including family name, prefixes, etc.? Or could I use one "full" instance and one instance with just the initials, without repeating family name and prefix and such? Or should I do something else altogether?</p>
