<p>Sorry to go back to DSTU2! I'm trying to represent participants in an appointment in DSTU2. In particular I'm trying to represent a Chaperone and an Advocate (which I'm assuming will be a RelatedPerson). In the DSTU2 appointment, the participant types are tied down to the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/encounter-participant-type" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/encounter-participant-type">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/encounter-participant-type</a> list (i.e. required), which doesn't support detail. Even this list in RelatedPerson.relationship (which isn't the correct place to model this data!) is tied down to the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/relatedperson-relationshiptype" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/relatedperson-relationshiptype">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/relatedperson-relationshiptype</a>, which mostly covers blood and non-blood relatives, but not chaperone or advocate. Has anyone else encountered this problem in DSTU2, and if so what was the solution. I know that STU3 has made the Appointment.paticipant.type extensible, but this is a project in DSTU2.</p>

<p>Chaperone could be a RelatedPerson or a Practitioner (depending on whether it's someone from the clinic acting in their professional capacity or someone the patient brings along).  Unfortunately in DSTU2, your only way around the brokenness of it being 'required' is to use an extension and omit type.</p>
