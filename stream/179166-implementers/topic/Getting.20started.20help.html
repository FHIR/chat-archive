<p>I need to understand the code base to make a PR , I was just looking for someone to point me in the right direction , and connect me with the resources to learn from. I have an urgent need for fhir integration into an app architecture, all the tutorials on youtube seem to be descriptive in nature.</p>

<p>What are you wanting to make a PR against?  There are a variety of code bases for different languages.  There are streams specific to each reference implementation - as well as detailed documentation for each reference implementation.  There are typically also recorded tutorials that explain the use of the RIs.</p>
