<p>for <br>
GET [base]/Practitioner?name=[name]<br>
what is the search logic we should implement? is it 'field matches a string query if the value of the field equals or starts with the supplied parameter value'? <br>
in this case for our client which is a very large organization, we might have such a large amount of answers what will cause a performance issue and the search will not be completed. how should we handle this scenario? can we fail the response and respond with error or warning to tell the user to narrow/focus his search (by searching a more exact name for example)?</p>

<p>Part of the answer lies in paging, so the server could return an initial page of results whilst continuing (or: deferring) any additional processing of the query. If the query is determined to be 'too costly', or can't be processed because of other technical/business reasons, the server could simply return an error. Do include an OperationOutcome resource to inform a client of the reasons why.</p>

<p>That "continue processing" approach can only work if the server isn't asserting that the information returned will be sorted in some sort of order.</p>
