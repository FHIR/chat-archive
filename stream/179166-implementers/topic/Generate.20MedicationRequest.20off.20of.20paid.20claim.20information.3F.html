<p>If all you have is the paid claim information, and that data includes the ordering practitioner for the prescription on the drug claim information, is it appropriate to create the MedicationRequest resource and populate the practitioner as the MedicationRequest.requester reference (and populate Claim.prescription with that MedicationRequest reference)? <br>
Or should we populate the ordering practitioner as a member of the Claim.careTeam and indicate their role is the ordering provider? (Or is there a third option that is the best practice?).</p>
<p>In summary, trying to understand if MedicationRequest is an object that can be created off of only paid claim information or if that MedicationRequest resource should be only populated by clinical data provider.</p>

<p>It may be better to create a MedicationDispense since it was likely a dispense that generated the claim. There is a System in Ontario, Canada that populates a repository in this way.</p>
