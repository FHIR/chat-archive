<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I am new to this forum and this domain, so upfront apologies if the question is irrelevant or too noob to be posted here. </p>
<p>I am trying to see if I can search all the patients for a physician using HAPI API (FHIR 4.0.0). The hl7 standard <a href="http://url" target="_blank" title="http://url">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html</a> says that you can search something like this.</p>
<p>`Note that chained parameters are applied independently to the target resource. For example,</p>
<p>GET Patient?general-practitioner.name=Joe&amp;general-practitioner.address-state=MN`</p>
<p>And I feel this is what may satisfy my usecase but wanted to confirm and also wanted to check what is corresponding HAPI API method(Java) that I need to use</p>

<p>Careful: since Patient.generalPractitioner is 0..*, your search could potentially return false positve Patients that have one GP thats called "joe" and another that lives in "MN"</p>

<p>I'd recommend to use _revinclude with something like /Practitioner?name=x&amp;address=y&amp;_revinclude=Patient:general-practitioner</p>
<p>see <a href="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html#revinclude" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html#revinclude">http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html#revinclude</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, you could first search for the GP by both name and address and then query for the Patients by using /Patient?general-practitioner._id=x<br>
While the _revinclude will give you a Bundle with both the Practitioner <em>and</em> the Patients, this way you'd get only the Patients...<br>
Depends on what you need...</p>

<p>Alternately use the practitioners id resolving that first before executing this query.<br>
I'd also be curious on the real purpose for the query, as there are many forms of this, such as those with appointments, or rthose that had an encounter in the last 2 years or...</p>

<p>Thank you for the response. The use case would be something as simple as like i want a physician portal and when the physician logs in he sees all his patients information and additionally lets say phyisician wants to further filter patients based on some criteria</p>
