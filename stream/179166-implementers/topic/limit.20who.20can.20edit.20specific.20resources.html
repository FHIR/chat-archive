<p>I'm looking for an authorization mechanism to ensure resources can only be edited by the original author of a resource.</p>
<p>In a simpler data model this would be trivial - resources would have a "createdBy" field which can be compared to the id of the authenticated user of a write request against that resource. However I haven't come across an appropriate generic way to do this in FHIR.</p>
<p>It looks like using some combination of security labels, provenance and/or history (+ JWT information) would seem like the way to go. I can see a number of possible approaches though and am curious how other implementers have approached this? And how this approach would differ when the author is not an individual, but a system for example?</p>

<p>if you need a createdBy, you could have an extension</p>

<p>An extension would allow to add a "createdBy" field, but my understanding is that this information is covered by the Provenance resource so its use should be preferred over adding an extension, right?</p>

<p>The only thing that strikes me as odd is that provenance is application-prepared, until now I always thought of this information as being set by the server (trusted)</p>

<p>It depends on the use-case.  Some Provenance information is usually included inside the resource.  However, if the use-case is that you're always going to need it when determining access permissions, joining to Provenance isn't going to be terribly efficient/reasonable.  A redundant extension would be acceptable in that case.</p>

<p>Yes, often there is some provenance in the resource that can be used to perform these kinds of checks. <br>
 I will probably opt for using <code>Meta.source</code>. which will enable my use-case with minimal complexity.</p>

<p>Yes Meta.source is one model for this. Another is to use meta.security where you tag each resource as it is created with a 'security compartment' code. Where you are managing the 'security compartment' codes, one for each user (aka, the user's name becomes a compartment code).  Then when an Update or Delete is attempted, you can just compare the user identity to the resource.meta.security... In this way you can evolve to multi-ownership of resources, and even group ownership.</p>

<p>Both of these models (meta.source or meta.security) would be examples (simple) of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC).</p>
