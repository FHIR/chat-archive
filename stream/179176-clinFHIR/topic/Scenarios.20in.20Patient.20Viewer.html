<p>Following on from a stream in <a href="#narrow/stream/179160-social/topic/Trivial.20tutorial.20please" title="#narrow/stream/179160-social/topic/Trivial.20tutorial.20please">social</a> I've added the ability to have pre-configured 'scenarios' (or 'resource graphs') in Patient Viewer. The idea is to create graph to show how to use FHIR to represent specific scenarios - primarily for educational purposes either for clinicians or patients. </p>
<p>To check it out, make sure the data server is hapi-4 (as that's where the examples are) then load Patient Viewer. You'll see a new button at the upper right - 'Select Scenario'. Clicking that will display a dialog with the pre-configured scenarios - at the moment there are 3 of them. Selecting one will display that patient. </p>
<p>Anyone can create scenarios - either manually or using graph builder - I'll write up the process, and link to it from here. </p>
<p>One thing it has shown is that large scenarios (like the <a href="https://github.com/chronic-care/sample-data" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/chronic-care/sample-data">care plan ones</a> I brought over from gihub) do look a mess in the graph views. It gets a bit better if you select a resource, then go to the references tab on the right  - that only shows the directly connected resources which is a bit more manageable. An area that I'll put a bit of time into...</p>
