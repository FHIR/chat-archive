<p>When creating a reference in the logical modeller, the options for a target (and right now you can only have one) that you get are to other logical models on the server. It would be easy enough to add the 'standard' resource types (though the UI might need a bit of thought) - question is, is that the right thing to do? </p>
<p>For now, the work around is to create a new logical model based on the type you want to refer to and use that - but it's not a great long term solution..</p>
<p>(in response to a private message, but would be interested in any comments)</p>
