<p>Defined a care plan definition that had a multitude of sections and subsections.  Choose to do a plan with child plans that had in turn child activities.  Could have done child activities.  Could have also flattened the whole thing out - one plandef with all activity defs.  Flexibility is useful but when this is profiled or used in an implementation guide I hope this would be tightened up - many opportunities for variances and as a result incompatibilities.</p>
