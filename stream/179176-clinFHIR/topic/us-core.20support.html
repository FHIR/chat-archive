<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191321">@David Hay</span> - once again, ClinFHIR was well received during the tutorials at DevDays! You'll hopefully see and uptick on usage. Just wanted to check in to see if you were able to make any progress on supporting complex extensions like US-Core.  It seems like more and more use cases start with US-Core profiles. </p>
<p>Thank you for creating and maintaining in essential tool for the FHIR Community!</p>

<p>Hi Viet - thanks for that - glad it was helpful! We should have a chat some time. I'm working on this from a different angle - actually in conman (and I know you don't like the name :) ) using  forms based approach. With a bit of luck it should all be working by Baltimore...</p>
