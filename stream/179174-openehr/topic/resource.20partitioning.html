<p>One of the things I was interested to discuss was the use of resource partitioning within FHIR, as per my blog post (<a href="http://wolandscat.net/2015/12/20/making-fhir-work-for-everybody/" target="_blank" title="http://wolandscat.net/2015/12/20/making-fhir-work-for-everybody/">http://wolandscat.net/2015/12/20/making-fhir-work-for-everybody/</a>). This would allow mature reference models that have many years of development and deployment in the field to work nearly natively within FHIR, which would then bring the relevant content models, patterns, workflow models and much else into play. Right now, we are stuck with a painful  mapping exercise just to map basic content. I'm hoping that FHIR can be made an open standard in this respect.</p>

<p>We're still working through that. It's certainly generating substantial resistance </p>
