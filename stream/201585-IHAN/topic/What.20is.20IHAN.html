<p>IHAN started as a parallel to IBAN, the International Bank Account Number. We store health and wellness data into various accounts, and should be able to transfer it between those accounts, hence the need for an International Health Account Number. Then things momentarily got a bit out of hand, and the scope was expanded to cover more than just health and wellness data (International Human Account Number), and also the operational model (International Human Account Network). It all became a bit too much, so now it’s called IHAN - Human-Driven Data Economy.</p>

<p>The aim of the project is to produce specifications for the architecture required for new kind of data economy. This includes technical specifications for<br>
- consent management<br>
- distributed logging and log inspection<br>
- data portability<br>
among other things like rulebooks for all the parties involved in the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Ideally, we'd also get labels for describing defined terms and conditions. The similar we have for "fair trade" or "organically produced", or similar to concepts of Creative Commons licenses or well known open source software licenses.  The point being that the consumer would not need to read through pages and pages of legal text, rather they'd know from a glance what they're consenting to and how the model works.</p>
