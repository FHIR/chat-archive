<p>I'm wondering if others have thought about exporting history of resources and what method they took to do it? We've been considering if we would want to support this in our FHIR server and have considered both exporting from the history end point and exporting with a history parameter.</p>

<p>Historical record would be critical to audit records  across various FHIR services, but it's a lot of data</p>

<p>We have thought about history export - it's a bit different from regular export as the output comes in history bundles. Alternatively, one could output regular resources for the current resource versions plus history bundles for the past, to make it a superset of regular $export. But that's probably not what consumers of the data want as it wouldn't be round-trip compatible with POSTing history bundles, or an $import operation. It needs to be compatible with some way of getting the data imported on the other end.</p>
<p>I would do $export with a history parameter rather than attaching it to the _history API. It will need all of the status checking, output locations, etc. functionality from $export.</p>
<p>Filtering on $export may be more difficult as historical versions might not be indexed the same way as current versions.</p>
