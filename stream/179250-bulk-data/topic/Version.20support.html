<p>Looking through the documentation and the references to resources such as Group and Patient the IG is developed against R4.  However, I do not believe I have seen anything that the IG relies on such that it cannot be backported to DSTU2, would that be a correct assumption?  I get that DSTU2 does not have the async request pattern, but that seems agnostic to the actual version of fhir, and I don't see anything in Group or Patient that is being used based strictly on the R4 resource defs.  Is there a plan to have a back ported IG for DSTU2 or something in the IG that states there is nothing in that strictly ties it to R4?</p>

<p>You are correct! We expect bulk data can be implemented on top of FHIR DSTU2 or later.</p>

<p>(That said, it certainly was not our focus and putting together the guide.)</p>
