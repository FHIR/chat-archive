<p>Is there a recommended field anywhere in HL7 V2 for the CMS <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/place-of-service-codes/Place_of_Service_Code_Set">1500 24b</a> place of service code? We primarily need to distinguish between office "11" codes and inpatient hospital "21" codes for calculating certain care quality measures. The PV1-2 (patient class) field sort of fits, however I am hesitant to use it because the recommended values in User-defined Table 0004 don't align with the CMS value set. I understand some organizations are also using PV1-10 (hospital service) but that doesn't seem right either. Has anyone ever written a US realm implementation guide covering this topic?</p>

<p>I can't speak to the right place, but I'm pretty sure there is no v2 IG that covers this.</p>

<p>FT1-37 seems to reference place of service.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion. I agree that would probably be a better fit than PV1-2 or PV1-10, however unfortunately the FT1 segment isn't included in any ADT message structures and for this use case we need to handle ADTs. It's probably not worth submitting a change proposal to add the FT1 segment to those message structures at this point.</p>

<p>I wonder if PV1-3 could be used, even though it is more for identifiers of locations, and not codes. It is not only for inpatient locations, and it references clinic as a valid use. FT1-37 also reference clinics as a place of service...</p>

<p>Expanding PV1-3 seems to make sense.</p>

<p>Not sure about the background details here. Just want to mention that user-defined tables can be adjusted to local needs. So if someone believes to use other codes than listed in the standard then this is fine.<br>
Although I highly appreciate that this question is raised here.</p>
