Hi,</p>
<p>I have a technical HL7 query I was hoping you could answer please.<br>
When a system receives a HL7 message and a data item is blank, is the receiving system allowed to convert the blank data type with a “ in order to ensure old data is deleted in the field so that the new data being displayed is correct? Or is there a strict standard that says that is not allowed?</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Sharla Passariello</p>
<p>Edit: this is for HL7v2</p>

<p>A blank field in v2 message does not mean the data is to be deleted, thus translating it on receipt to indicate it should be deleted is not appropriate.  Only if the field explicitly includes "" (double quote) is it meant to be deleted.  A blank field, absent double quotes, only means that the message does not contain that data.  It can be known on the source system, just not included.</p>
<p>Depending on the standard/implementation guide/profile the field may be required.  If in that case the field is blank, it is still not an indication to delete, rather an error by the sender to conform to the proper standard/implementation guide/profile.</p>
