<p>We talked today about putting time limits on accessing a  Task and I<br>
looked to <code>Task.restriction.period</code></p>
<p>Definition  Over what time-period is fulfillment sought.</p>
<p>but I was informed this is not what it means.  This Is confusing since I interpret the defintiion as the lifetime of a task - no matter the outcome</p>
<p>was does it mean and should there be a way to represent termination date on a Task?</p>

<p>It means "when does the Task need to be executed".  There's no general concept of a lifespan on a resource.  In general, all resources are expected to hang around forever - which in practice means "until the system doesn't exist anymore" or "until performance considerations cause the data to be archived" or "until business rules say we're no longer required to expose it".  So Tasks, once created, stay around forever unless someone deletes them or there are business rules that say otherwise.</p>

<p>The description of Task.restriction states</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the Task.focus is a request resource and the task is seeking fulfillment (i.e. is asking for the request to be actioned), this element identifies any limitations on what parts of the referenced request should be actioned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me that means that you can only use Task.restriction if the Task is for fulfillment of another request resource, and the restriction identifies what subset of the request is supposed to be fulfilled. A possible example could be a standing order (the request), and  a single instantiation for fulfillment (the Task).</p>
<p>To answer the actual question, <code>Task.restriction.period</code>  is only used in relation to another request resource, specifically regarding request.occurrence[x]</p>

<p>maybe an extension saying the output is available for some duration would be useful ( "you got 30 days to look at this")?  I am spit-balling here but that is what I think the commenter is wanting the ability to control and expose to the requester.  But I admit my ignorance here and this may be controlled by some other mechanism such as authentication scopes</p>

<p>I assume this is in the context of one of the Da Vinci profiles, where the requester POSTs a Task, and the responder updates the Task with pointers to the resources to be pulled by the requester. In that case, can you add another output for this specific purpose? The implementation of the actual timing restriction, however, is best left to the authorization layer, I think. In general, the notion of disappearing resources is not something that is expected in a FHIR implementation</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think so. I meant that the implementation of the timing restriction (i.e. client X is not allowed to view resources A, B and C after time point T) is better done at the authorization layer (e.g. any authorization tokens are set to expire on the deadline). Indicating the deadline to a user is better done via something on the resource, my off-the cuff suggestion was to have an output of a special type to convey that.</p>

<p>Note the specific use-case of authorizing access for a given reason for a given agent for a given time... seems like a good use-case to use for the development of the Permission resource. I am not saying what you have in Task is not right, but the authorization portion seems overloading Task; thus it might be okay for specific use but the permission concept  would be a more reusable if we can get it well defined (it is not well defined today).</p>

<p>Would implementing a restriction at the authorization layer provide for Task limitations (e.g., this Task is allowed to reoccur for X patient(s) or this Task must be completed within 10 days) or would it limit the use of resources for specific tasks (e.g., using a resource for prior authorization but not for quality measurement) or both? Would the Permission resource provide for more granular control over resource use?</p>
