<p>I'm looking at ways of introducing FHIR Workflow. <br>
FHIR Workflow seems to bring in a number of answers but it seems we need a 'point of sharing'. <br>
This is where the Tasks will reference and we would probably need combinations of HL7 v2 and FHIR Messaging.</p>

<p>Long term we could look to move the 'point of sharing' as early as possible in the workflow (and do away with the messaging).</p>
<p>I'm thinking the messages and Tasks will have overlap.<br>
e.g. a FHIR Message prescription-order will have eventCoding of prescription-order and the Task.code will also be prescription-order.</p>
<p>Wondering if I should use FHIR Communication as a text notification version of a Task (or just use Task.description). I'm thinking this should be conversation at a high level. <br>
We may have text notifications which are just 'prescription has been dispatched via Acme Logistics' with pointers to the FHIR resources. This sounds more like FHIR Communication?</p>

<p>So your requirement is that the placer can only communicate via messaging, but you're looking for an intermediary to translate that into a FHIR Restful approach where a Task is instantiated and the filler receives a subscription notification, grabs the Task and whatever else they need and interacts RESTfully and, once the Task is in an end state, the intermediary generates a response message?  That should be doable.  In fact, I wouldn't even mind updating the workflow page to show that as an approach, as it provides an onramp to doing things in a RESTful way.</p>
<p>Not sure you need the Communication resource.  If someone's monitoring the Task, the Task business status would be updated (possibly with an output pointing to the MedicationDispense)</p>

<p>I think so. Having a 'point of sharing' is sounding like an approach to moving from traditional messaging to rest. <br>
Long term we can move that point to the placer.</p>

<p>Care to submit a change request for us to document this approach in R5?</p>

<p>This does seem like the logical thing to do (and what our prototype workflow manager does). As far as I am aware, there is also currently no way of describing how resources will be shared between tasks (source/destination pairs as per traditional workflow engines) which would be nice as well.</p>

<p>Understand what you mean. For our prescription-orders we know what resources we expect and for FHIR Messaging we have created MessageDefinitions. <br>
Intend to look at reusing those to define the Tasks.</p>
