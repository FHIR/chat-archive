<blockquote>
<p>an activity definition provides a reusable template that can be used to construct specific request resources</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this imply that the (relevant) details from a Definition should be copied into a given Request? Or does the Request just point back tot he definition, and consumers are supposed to follow the link to understand these details? In other words: when a Request points back to a Definition, is this just "FYI, this was the template used to create this request", or is it "For all of the details of what's being requested, you'll need to read this Definition"? </p>

<p>Either approach is permitted.  In general, copying the content is generally preferred to minimize the number of resources that need to be retrieved to get the full picture.  But it's legitimate to have an order that just says "Run protocol XYZ for patient John Smith starting tomorrow"</p>
