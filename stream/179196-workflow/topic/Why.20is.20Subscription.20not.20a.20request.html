<p>Subscription is asking for something but is not listed in the request pattern.  Is there a reason why</p>

<p>It's a technical structure, not a clinical / business authorization.</p>

<p>We redefined it as:  "Describes a particular client's request to be notified about a Topic."  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>   was the intent to imply its a request.  if so would be need to follow the resource pattern?</p>

<p>It's not a clinical or business resource.  It's like MessageHeader.  None of the intents would make any sense.  It should NOT try to follow the Request pattern.</p>

<p>Eric is suggesting that Subscription should need to align with this pattern: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/request.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/request.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/request.html</a></p>

<p>Is Subscription in the same category of resources as MedicationRequest, ServiceRequest, DeviceRequest, VisionPrescription, etc.?</p>

<p><strong>Request</strong> is - at the moment - an authorisation stating that something may/should/could be done and responded to, or just delegated, or postponed, or postprocessed, and is kept in medical / financial records. We have a pattern to avoid weird ways of doing that kind of stuff. Say a committees wants to create a resource like "TransplantNeeded". or worse, a resource called "Transplant" with a mood/status flag "needed / done"  - this is what the pattern is avoiding.</p>
<p><strong>Subscription</strong> seems a technical way for a system to enable another to send it updates of whatever is on the server that matches some criteria. It is not an actionable request as the former. So I understand it is not in the request.  I can understand that it implies some functionality, but it is not in the level of the requests. Perhaps <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> is looking at it from a purely functional perspective, where it would make sense to keep track of subscriptions, e.g. for auditing purposes. We could address that but at a first glance i don't equate Subscription and Request. but there is no harm in seeing what could be harmonized there, as a one-off.</p>
