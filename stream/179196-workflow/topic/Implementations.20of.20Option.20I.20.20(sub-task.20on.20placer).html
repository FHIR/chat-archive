<p>Has there been any implementations that have used Workflow pattern Option I where a sub-task created by the filler in the placer system after the Task is created by the Place in the Filler system?<br>
The benefit of not using polling/subscriptions is tempting given the potential number of endpoints that Fillers and Placers may need to monitor in Options F &amp; G for laboratory orders.<br>
Is there a pattern that has been adopted in majority of lab order implementations?</p>

<p>I don't think that there have been very many lab implementations of FHIR.  (At least not that I've heard of.)</p>
