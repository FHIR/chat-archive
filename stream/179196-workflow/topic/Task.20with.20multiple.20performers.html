<p>We have a task in which we need people to sign a paper document. It is a single document but requires multiple signers. For example, in an IVF context it may require both a patient and their partner to sign an intake form.</p>
<p>Since a Task can only have one Owner, how should we handle this? One idea was to have one task for the document as a whole, and a subtask for each signer. Would that be the best approach or is there something I'm missing?</p>

<p>I think one task per signer is appropriate.  If you want to have an overall Task that involves monitoring and making sure that the subtasks are completed that's certainly viable, but not essential.</p>
