<p>I'm working through the WorkflowIssues warnings for EpisodeOfCare.  One of the warnings is about EpisodeOfCare.diagnosis.condition including a Reference(Condition) which is not a type in the pattern in Event.reasonReference.  </p>
<p>But it is...  Event.reasonReference does include Condition.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  &lt;issue severity=&quot;Warning&quot; pattern=&quot;Event&quot; path=&quot;Event.reasonReference&quot; issue=&quot;Element includes types not found in pattern&quot;&gt;The element EpisodeOfCare.diagnosis.condition includes the following type(s) that are not part of the pattern: Reference(Condition).  If the types should be considered for addition to the pattern, contact the FHIR Workflow project.  Otherwise, add this warning to the &#39;suppressed-workflow-warnings&#39; file.&lt;/issue&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>Is that an error in the report, or am I missing something?</p>

<p>Error in the report.  I'll try to get a fix out next week.</p>

<p>Also, since EpisodeOfCare can involve several actors, having a 1..* for our mapping to Event.performer.actor seems reasonable, correct?</p>
<p>&lt;issue severity="Warning" pattern="Event" path="Event.performer.actor" issue="Element max cardinality made repeating"&gt;The element EpisodeOfCare.team has increased the maximum cardinality from 1 to *.  Is it in the 80% for this element to repeat?  Is there a need to change the workflow pattern?  Please discuss with the workflow project.&lt;/issue&gt;</p>

<p>I would map to Event.performer rather than Event.performer.actor - the actors and roles would be inside the team</p>

<p>But yes, no cardinality issues - though I'm not clear on why you'd need multiple teams given that eam has 0..* within it.  (And not sure how you'd interpret multiple people with the same role from different teams)</p>
