<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>My org is looking for a new digital forms platform (for authoring, rendering, and collecting Patient data associated with appointments, surgeries, and even marketing).</p>
<p>Are there any leading vendors that support FHIR out of the box?<br>
Do you know any good open-source FHIR implementations capable of managing the full lifecycle of forms management?<br>
Any other good advice or suggestions?<br>
Thank you!</p>

<p>It sort of depends on what you mean by "full lifecycle".  There's a list of Questionnaire implementations <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIRI/SDC+Implementations">here</a>, though it's not necessarily complete.</p>

<p>Thanks again <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> </p>
<p>I see only a couple of fully productized sources mainly European (as opposed to open source) solutions.<br>
Can you speak a bit to how you see adoption into more mainstream products/platforms?</p>

<p>It's hard to see big-picture plans (because no-one needs to share them...)  I know that US-core (which reflects the intentions of a lot of big multi-national EHR companies, even though it's officially US-centric) is taking relatively shallow steps into the Questionnaire space, with most complex behavior being dealt with through 'adaptive forms'.  Some of the Da Vinci IGs are mandating more sophisticated capabilities involving CQL population and flow control - with a potential for regulatory requirement for those things.  How much that will manifest in commercial offerings is unclear.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="480704">@Yuval Romm</span> </p>
<p>There is a free and open-source suite of FHIR Questionnaire form management software in the US, called LHC Forms.</p>
<p>The form builder is at  <a href="https://lhcformbuilder.nlm.nih.gov/">https://lhcformbuilder.nlm.nih.gov/</a></p>
<p>The LHC Forms Widget <a href="https://lhcforms.nlm.nih.gov/">https://lhcforms.nlm.nih.gov/</a>  can be embedded in your website.  It will render your FHIR Questionnaire and submit the answers (create the Questionnaire Response). </p>
<p>The project page is at <a href="http://lhncbc.github.io/lforms/">http://lhncbc.github.io/lforms/</a></p>
<p>It is actively maintained and updated versions are frequently released. </p>
<p>Since LHC-Forms is open source, you can customize it to your organization's needs.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="237340">@Diane</span>  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <br>
I looked into some of the open-source solutions and LHC as well. It does look very good but obviously dev-heavy to deploy, maintain, support.<br>
It seems that organizations need to make a strategic decision when adopting a forms solution between three (there may be more ) alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adopt a fully productized (code-light or no-code) non-FHIR forms platform and wait until industry/regulation force a move to FHIR as more vendors bake FHIR into their platforms.</li>
<li>Adopt an open-source FHIR Questionnaire tool and create integrations into existing workflows/systems.</li>
<li>Adopt a non-FHIR product (as in option #1) and write a <strong>code-heavy</strong> layer of FHIR transformations into a FHIR repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>To a certain extent, it depends what you're trying to do.  Most non-FHIR forms platforms don't have the population, extraction, and some of the other capabilities that SDC offers.  So if you need those, you need FHIR.  If your requirements are simpler, then the drivers would be the ability to share the forms and responses with systems who don't necessarily use those same commercial solutions.  </p>
<p>How 'code heavy' your implementation is going to be depends on how much you leverage existing libraries.  There are also generic transformation tools that you can use to convert between XML and JSON syntax, so you're not necessarily doing all of the work in code, though even if using GUI mapping tools, it'd be code-like.</p>

<p>Have you looked at existing PROMs platforms? Depending on your use-case this might be a good starting point, since they do forms lifecycle, plus data analytics, benchmarking, sometimes special study support, incl. FDA compliance. I'm sure they will move towards FHIR APIs, some are already mentioning it (see: <a href="https://mrdm.com/platform/">https://mrdm.com/platform/</a>).</p>
