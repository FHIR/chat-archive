<p>I'm trying to understand a bit more about using the Consent resource. Is Consent simply the representation of the patient/client giving that consent? Does it actually have any text in it that is presented the patient?</p>
<p>For instance, if I have a document requesting consent to give a patient blood products. It has all of the patient's information, explanation of benefits, risks, etc. Would that information be stored in a consent? Or would that information be stored in something like a questionnaire, and if the patient agrees (and signs), then a Consent resource would be created to document &amp; record this action?</p>

<p>Consent can point to a few things as source - it could be a QuestionnaireResponse.  It could be a DocumentReference (e.g. a scanned/faxed image) or it could be a Contract (e.g. an electronically represented assertion tied to block-chain or some other new-fangled attestation mechanism).  PDF is probably most typical, QuestionnaireResponse second and anything else would be cutting edge/research stage.</p>
