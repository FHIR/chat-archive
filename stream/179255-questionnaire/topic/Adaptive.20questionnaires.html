<p>Hi, I have two questions wrt Adaptive Questionnaires from the SDC spec:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why QuestionnaireResponse.contained is required filed in the Adaptive Questionnaire Response profile? Isn’t it NOT necessary to have contained Questionnaire in the QuestionnaireResponse in the request body of POST [base]/Questionnaire/$next-question?  If the questionnaire (with the defined questions) is known to the External Assessment Center, isn’t it enough the request body to contain QuestionnaireResponse with reference to the questionnaire (not contained Questionnaire) and an item with a response?</li>
<li>Why the response body of the "next question" operation contains contained Questionnaire resource with all items already administered and all answer items previously sent back? If the External Assessment Center has the questionnaire with the questions, and the Patient Facing App is taking care of storing the questions and answers accordingly, isn’t it enough the response to only include the new question in the QuestionnaireResponse.contained (without all items already administered and all answer items previously sent back)?</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>From server to client, the contained Questionnaire tells what to display on the screen.  From client to server, it shows what questions were asked, given that some might not have been answered and thus won't appear in the QuestionnaireResponse piece.</li>
<li>The presumption is that the invocation is stateless.  The server will have no record of what's previously been asked or what answers have been given.</li>
</ol>
