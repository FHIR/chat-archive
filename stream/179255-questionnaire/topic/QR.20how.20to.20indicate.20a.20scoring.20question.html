<p>I'm trying to implement a QuestionnaireResponse with scoring questions (questions whose response value is calculated based on answers to other questions in the qnr). From reading past threads it seems the way to do this is to treat it as a normal question and put the score in QR.item.answer.value, but then my question is how to indicate that this response is a generated score and not a patient entered response? I saw a past answer by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  mentioning marking it as a "read-only" field but I don't know how to do this, would that involve using an extension?</p>
