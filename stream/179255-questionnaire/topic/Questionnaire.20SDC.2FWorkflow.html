<p>Hi,<br>
I have a few questions regarding the SDC Questionnaire Roles and workflow. I apologize if some of them have been addressed earlier.<br>
I am creating a repo of FHIR Questionnaires that will be rendered to the user on an app in a mobile device. <br>
1.  My repo will contain many questionnaires and they will be rendered to the user (Form Filler) based on a trigger/threshold etc. Can the From Manager be a web server/json placeholder independent of the FHIR Server? Form Manager can/will generate an initial QuestionnaireResponse, partially populated with information known by the Form Manager/ Form Filler. How will the interaction between different roles (Form Filler, Form Manager) and the FHIR Server be governed by the SDC Guide?<br>
2.  Questionnaires can be pre-populated by the Form Manager or the Form Filler. The Form Filler will be interfacing with a personal device to get data (most likely Observations including Blood Pressure, Pulse etc.). Does the data from Device need to be mapped to FHIR Observations to be populated in the QuestionnaireResponse (item/answer.value)?<br>
3.  For the workflow I foresee a PlanDefinition (with Questionnaires), Task for the request and the Event will most likely be a QuestionnaireResponse. I could not find much information regarding the Workflow Module implementation including relevant examples in the context of SDC guide. Any help or relevant examples with the required resources will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Ozair</p>

<ol>
<li>Not sure what you mean by "independent of the FHIR server".  A Form Manager is, by definition, a FHIR server.  That doesn't mean you couldn't have some other sort of system that stored Questionnaires and made them available (e.g. an FTP server), but it wouldn't be conformant as an SDC "Form Manager".  The SDC guide defines the expected operations (as both client and server) that the different systems are expected to (or encouraged to) support.  Did you look at the CapabilityStatements for each of the roles?</li>
<li>SDC defines how to populate from data that's stored in FHIR.  It's possible that you could embed metadata in a Questionnaire that would allow population from non-FHIR sources, but that would be outside the scope of SDC specifications</li>
<li>We've agreed to add more guidance around the use of Task in workflow, though there's a profile here: <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/StructureDefinition-sdc-task.html">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/StructureDefinition-sdc-task.html</a>.  Essentially, to ask for a Questionnaire to be completed, you POST the Task - either to the filler system or somewhere they monitor for it.  They update the Task to reflect agreement/refusal, progress and link the QuestionnaireResponse as a Task.output.  If there's a PlanDefinition or ActivityDefinition, the QuestionnaireResponse can point to that with instantiates.</li>
