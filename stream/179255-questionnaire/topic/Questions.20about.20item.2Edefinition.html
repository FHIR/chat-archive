<p>At yesterday's SDC call, we were looking at <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-28305">J#28305</a>, and a number of questions came up, which I am copying below from that tracker item (with minor editing):</p>
<p>1) We have an issue with setting (from item.definition) required and repeats which have "meaning if missing" and may not be safe to omit if they should be true according to the definition - would like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  to be here for that discussion. </p>
<p>2) Do we want to use a 'compile' approach to retrieve the definition?  And maybe a flag that says that's necessary?</p>
<p>3) Could we have an extension in 'type' that would allow overriding?  </p>
<p>4) Also - why isn't item.text being set from ElementDefinition.label?</p>
