<p>I need to create a questionnaire with the question  that would ask patient about his temperature (so it would have item with type=Quantity) but also a patient should have an option to specify that he doesn't know his temperature.<br>
My proposal is to send this as two items in group with some special extension for client that would render this, but I am not sure that this is a good way<br>
What is the right way to do it?</p>

<p>You could have a first question that asks whether a temperature is available, then a child question that is enabled if the answer is yes that captures the value (and if you wish, an additional child question that is enabled if the answer is 'no' that captures a reason why not).  No group necessary and no extension - enableWhen is part of core.</p>
