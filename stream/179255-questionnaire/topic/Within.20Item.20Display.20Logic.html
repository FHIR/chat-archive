<p>I would like to display different text for the same item based on some logic. Specifically, I have a question where the answers are similar, but the phrasing differs based on age (but it's a similar concept, so I'd like to capture it as the same linkId for later comparisons). For instance,</p>
<p>0-13 years old: Do you need assistance finding a job (assumes parents are completing the questionnaire)? "Yes", "No", "I don't Know"<br>
14-17 years old: Do you or your parents need assistance finding a job? "Yes", "No", "I don't Know"<br>
18+: Do you need assistance finding a job (assumes patient is completing the questionnaire)? "Yes", "No", "I don't Know"</p>

Has anyone else dealt with this yet?</p>

<p>We're adding an extension to SDC to allow the item.text to be driven by an expression, so that might be an option.</p>
