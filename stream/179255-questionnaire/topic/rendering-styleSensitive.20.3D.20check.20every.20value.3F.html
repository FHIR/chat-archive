<p>Suppose rendering-styleSenstitive is set on root, and also that Questionnaire.url has an unexpected (for SDC) rendering-style extension.  Would an SDC client even be expected to notice the rendering-style extension sitting on Questionnaire.url?</p>

<p>I think so.  The extension isn't tied to any particular SDC profile, so the expectation would be to search for style extensions anywhere in the instance.</p>

<p>While we're talking about style, I notice that the extension <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extension-rendering-style.html</code> permits putting the explicit style on for an item to be rendered with, is there an equivalent you can put at the root of the document which is a link to a css file?<br>
(I have a custom extension like this already, and thought this might have been it, but noted that its explicitly inline, and item dependant)<br>
And even more, was this a style property rather than HTML class to apply? (which could then leverage the CSS allocated to the entire form)<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="195344">@Paul Lynch</span> do you do either of these?</p>

<p>No standard extension for a link to a CSS.  In part because there can be privacy issues with external links and in part because it's added complexity.  We didn't bother with classes because we have no support for a standard CSS.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191367">@Brian Postlethwaite</span> For <a href="https://lhncbc.github.io/lforms/" target="_blank" title="https://lhncbc.github.io/lforms/">LHC-Forms</a> I've partially implemented rendering-style with support for inline styles on Questionnaire.title, item.text, and item.prefix.  I am putting off styles on answer lists (ValueSets) for now.  In theory (though SDC does not ask for this) you could put rendering-style on the Questionnaire node, and then any styles you apply there should carry through to the child elements.  At least, that is my understanding how rendering-style is supposed to work, but at least in LHC-Forms support has to be explicitly added for each case.</p>
