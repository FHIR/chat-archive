<p>My questionnaire has  one group containing   Questions 1, 2, 3   and then one group containing Questions 4, 5, 6.    I want to store the answer to Question 1 in a variable to use for expressions used to populate Questions 2, 3 from the 1st group and then Questions 4, 5 and 6 from the 2nd group.   Where do I put the extension with the variable?     I was thinking of putting it on the group  item for the 1st group.   But then, is it only in scope for the 1st group?   Will the expressions in the 2nd group be able to access the variable declared in the 1st group?  Should any variables go at the header level for the Questionnaire?</p>

<p>A variable is only available to the item it's defined on and all descendants.  If you have a variable that references content in group 1 and needs to be available to a sibling group, then the variable needs to be on the parent of both groups - which might be the Questionnaire as a whole.</p>
