<p>LHC forms in its UI and in some commit comments on GitHub mentions LHC forms specific extensions. Since it seems a popular editor I would like to fully support its output. Is there a list of these extensions? I tried to locate one, but could not.<br>

<p>Agreed on this question. Would love to see that, if possible</p>

<p>Do you have a screenshot or a link for what you are looking at?  Off-hand I am not thinking of any custom extensions I would recommend others to use, but perhaps an example would change my mind.</p>

<p>I am referring to this image below, and I came across a mention of LHC extensions on your GitHub. I am  only building a form filler, so looking to point people towards a good editor to build forms for my filler. I like your editor quite a bit, would like to recommend it. In that combination I should expect that whatever your editor offers will be thrown at my filler. Therefore I am trying to get a complete picture of what might come out of your editor. I am just trying to be as interoperable as possible, not looking for a functionality in particular.<br>

<p>That is coming from the <a href="https://lhcformbuilder.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM Form Builder</a>.  I checked with the developer (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="195370">@Ajay Kanduru</span>), and it looks like there are three custom extensions which (mostly) have equivalents in SDC, so I would not recommend adding support for those, and actually, if Ajay can find time, I think our form builder should stop using those.  Ajay has been very busy working on a redesign and rewrite of the form builder, so it is not at up to date as it would otherwise be, particularly with regard to some of the newer changes (like being able setting an answer list based on another field's value, which our dataControl extension supported).</p>
