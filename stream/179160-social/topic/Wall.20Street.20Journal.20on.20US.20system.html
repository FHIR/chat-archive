<p>Of some relevance to why FHIR is important and disruptive because it puts some power in the consumer's hands:</p>
<p>Well known hospital consultant Vince Kuraitis blogged today about a new Wall Street Journal article on how hospitals try to dominate where their doctors send patients for referrals.  (WSJ has a lot of surprisingly good coverage of health issues.)  </p>
<p>Vince is a good guy but by the nature of his work he's usually aligned with the interests of executives, not the public.  </p>
<p>I wrote a comment in response to the post that points out how a large part of the problem is the lack of interop, which causes the #1 problem docs reported - the need for care coordination, which is impeded by lack of portability.  I cited FHIR as a game-changer on patient power. </p>
