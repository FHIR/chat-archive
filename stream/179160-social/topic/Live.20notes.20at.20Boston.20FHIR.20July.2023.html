<p>Most of y'all will have no use for this but I figured I might as well take notes in a place others can find them.  So I'll start with this post (6:15 pm local time) and edit it as the evening goes on, so it can grow without endless fake notifications.  </p>
<p>[Disclaimer: this is not intended to be an introduction to FHIR or anything else. It's just my notes FWIW.]</p>
<p><strong>I welcome [seek!] corrections!</strong></p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="228235">@Jocelyn Keegan</span> is the opening speaker, on Da Vinci.  Here's <a href="https://ehrintelligence.com/news/da-vinci-project-to-advance-healthcare-interoperability-fhir-use" target="_blank" title="https://ehrintelligence.com/news/da-vinci-project-to-advance-healthcare-interoperability-fhir-use">an overview article on Da Vinci</a> if you don't know about it.</p>
<p>At HIMSS 2019, 17 member companies volunteered to participate in that part of the interop showcase, and <strong>it worked</strong> - every 2 hours each vendor unplugged and moved to another hospital's station and plugged in there. (I myself have not been involved in HIT interop work, but apparently this is an unprecedented achievement in interop.)</p>

<p>The big thing about SMART on FHIR is that it provides a common interface for apps to talk to, which will work on any supporting EHR: Epic, Cerner, etc etc.  <strong>In health IT this is huge news.</strong> Most ordinary people expect any competent website to work regardless of what computer you're talking to, but in healthcare that's never been true.  SMART makes it possible, they say.</p>
<p><em>Next topic: The Bulk Data API</em></p>
<p>While a lot of health data transactions are for a single patient, a lot of other work (e.g. analyzing population health) requires telling an EHR to send <em>tons</em> of data - "Give me all your XYZ data about men between ages 25 and 55," etc. This is a whole different API.</p>
