<p>Many people are messaging me on this busy day to get my comments on Judy Faulkner's letter to her hospital customers urging that data not be shared.  I don't have time to blog so I tweeted this and a few more:<br>

<p>Just to clarify, step 4 in the 7-step process described in the article does not exist in this form in the proposed rule. The EHR is not allowed to impose any requirements on the app chosen by the patient, much less to "approve" it...</p>

<p>But this is a PROPOSED rule, yes?   </p>
<p>For those who want to be careful about slippery loopholes, this seems to be an important point, so I'll ask "as if stupid" questions. </p>
<ul>
<li>Desana's post says this 7-step process is "How this is supposed to work." <em>It doesn't say whether this is "supposed to work" <strong>in the proposed rule</strong> or <strong>today</strong>.</em>  Which?</li>
<li><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192685">@Vassil Peytchev</span> says step 4 doesn't exist in the proposed rule: "patient downloads a third-party app that is approved by the EHR to connect to the API."</li>

<p>Am I correct in thinking this is confusing?  And which is the "choice / no-choice" aspect - approval by the EHR?</p>

<p>This may be true for Patient centric app, where the end user Patient has access to their own data, but for Practitioner centric apps the registration &amp; approval is pretty onerous both technically and financially (very expensive for startups).</p>

<p>That is not exactly true for 3rd party app. Epic AppOrchard has 3rd party app approval process. Though not very complicated, a 3rd party app does need approved by Epic AppOrchard in order to be listed and pushed to providers' system.</p>

<p>Authentication vs authorization is a fun area.  Oauth is just the start as in the uk we then have roles the person is acting in (e.g. person logged in as admin may not be able to get data same person logged in as clinician may) etc.etc. Does the person then have the specific perms for that actual record etc.etc.etc. This then ties into the NHS RBAC codes &amp; if the person has a smartcard inserted etc.etc.  We found nothing off the shelf that would do what we wanted &amp; have had to assemble from existing pieces to even come close.</p>

<p>That's not my understanding. Adrian asked us to enforce it, not enable it. Enforcing things is ONC business, not HL7 business, so we did ignore it (well, we did explain...). </p>
<p>If there's something we're not to 'enable' it that we should in the standards, I don't know what it is. But I'd like to know....</p>

<p>Ok I will bite.  There is nothing in SMART on FHIR that requires an EHR to be what is interacted with.  You just have to be a server that follows the smart profiles.  Putting it on top of EHRs was their main use case but it could go on top of a lab system or on top of a patient's own server, a patient registry servr or a mobile device's server etc.</p>

<p>Just for the record, my beloved experts, this is thoroughly confusing, so for anyone who's interested in FUD, this is a happy place.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of the confusion, I believe, is that some people are talking about apps that will be used by a <strong>patient</strong> and other people are talking about apps that will be used by a <strong>clinician</strong>.  Meaningful Use stage 3 had rules about the apps a <strong>patient</strong> uses to get access to his or her own data - which I believe is what you're particularly interested in, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span>.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191912">@Michele Mottini</span> is correct above; when the developer of a patient-facing app wants that app to work with Epic, there's nothing that Epic or any org using Epic (in the US) needs to do to make it work.  </p>
<ol>
<li>The app developer (who could be the patient themself) goes to <a href="https://open.epic.com" target="_blank" title="https://open.epic.com">https://open.epic.com</a> and creates a record for the app.</li>
<li>Epic doesn't do anything.</li>
<li>Health care orgs using epic don't do anything.</li>
<li>An automatic job runs at the health care provider every few hours and downloads all the new client records.</li>
<li>The app works.  </li>
</ol>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> is also correct that the provider can blacklist apps and is also correct that they don't frequently proactively block applications.</p>

<p>To be even more concise, in Epic there is no vendor or provider approval process.  Making an app available to patients is entirely in the app developer's control.  </p>
<p><strong>The <em>only</em> person who needs to approve a patient-facing app to get that patient's data from Epic is the patient him- or herself.  </strong></p>

<p>Can confirm that, which is what made the initial letter, posting on the main site, and subsequent media response a little frustrating.</p>
<p>Epic is quite honestly doing quite well (leading) compared to other vendors between the three headed approach of <a href="http://open.epic.com" target="_blank" title="http://open.epic.com">open.epic.com</a>, <a href="http://USCDI.epic.com" target="_blank" title="http://USCDI.epic.com">USCDI.epic.com</a>, and App Orchard (as well as an extremely robust catalogue of traditional interfaces), but general external sentiment and goodwill is a little tainted by the messaging and associated perception.</p>
