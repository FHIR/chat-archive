<p>I talked to the HL7 staff about the loud buzzing in L507 (and presumably other LL conference rooms).  They're aware of the problem and are working on it.  The construction is actually at the building next door and not under Marriott's direct control, but Marriott has some influence and will try to get them to stop.</p>

<p>I had also complained to the HL7 staff about the construction noise. It's really bad in L506. Should we ask about moving remaining meetings to another room?</p>

<p>I asked about that.  They said there aren't any rooms available - we've filled all the ones we have - but they're also looking into whether we can switch them.</p>

<p>I got the impression that the folks on the Hl7 team are on top of it and doing everything they can.</p>
