<p>I'm sure I'm not the first to ask this, but now that I'm into Confluence, I'm TOTALLY LOST.  Trying to find the Patient Empowerment Workgroup screens that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191531">@Virginia Lorenzi</span> just demonstrated on our call ... nothing I do to search "Patient empowerment" in Confluence brings up a single hit.</p>
<p>This lack of "unpolished usability" is well known around here, I presume?  (And I know it's not an issue for the FHIR crew.)</p>
<p>I'm only posting this publicly in case it's NOT a well known issue, and/or in case a fresh "yelling person" does any good...</p>

<p>Once Patient Empowerment is an official work group, it'll get listed on the home screen.  That'll help.  My personal observation is that HL7 is still finding its "Confluence legs".  There's certainly more that we can do to improve navigation.  We haven't migrated most of the FHIR content over to Confluence yet in part because we haven't figured out how best to make it navigable (and because we don't want to reproduce the mess we have on the old MediaWiki site).  Certainly concrete suggestions on how to improve navigability are welcome.  General statements of "it's hard to find stuff" will be met with agreement, but don't necessarily point the way forward.</p>

<p>Three ways to find it:</p>
<p>1) I put Patient Empowerment in search and found Patient Empowerment home.</p>
<p>2) Also you can find in Spaces: Go to top bar - it says Spaces - click on<br>
that.  If Patient Empowerment does not appear in your "recent spaces" click<br>
on Space Directoryat the bottom of the dropdown menu and find Patient<br>
Empowerment there.  (In the future it will appear in your Recent Spaces)</p>
<p>3) Another way is to go to main screen and find it in list on far right<br>
under Projects &amp; Initiatives  (If we become a workgroup Patient Empowerment<br>
will be listed on this page under "Workgroups" to the right of<br>
Administrative Steering Division</p>

<p>Apologies, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>; I'm new enough here that I can't yet recognize what's new to all (still stumbling) vs a problem only for "broadly newbie" like me.  </p>
<p>To whom should general newbie Confluence problems be sent?  Happy to do what's useful.  I just need instruction. Thx.</p>

<p>If it's a clear "this is broken and has an obvious fix", then sending an email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@hl7.org" title="mailto:webmaster@hl7.org">webmaster@hl7.org</a> works (or you can directly ping David Johnson or Joshua Procious with a private or public message here.  If it's more "this seems annoying and there ought to be a better way", then starting a discussion just like you've done here is fine.</p>

<p>Good morning Dave, here is a helpful link for searching more efficiently in Confluence.
