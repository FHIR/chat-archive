<p>Hi! My colleague, Brad, and I are at our first DevDays. At Grand Rounds, we derive insights from healthcare data and use those insights to improve healthcare for ordinary people. We're evaluating the extent to which we will adopt FHIR in our org, and we're looking to connect with other companies that are doing ML over healthcare data to see if we can learn from each other. If you're here at DevDays and are open to talking (or just getting to know what GR does better), please let me know by replying here or sending a PM.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
