<p>Hello everyone, I am new to FHIR/ epic API and I am trying to start developing an integration with our healthcare software using the API. <br>
The problem that I have found so far is that I was asked to include clinical notes from our software and upload them to epic. but the endpoint has a mandatory input parameter for the encounter. and I don't manage to find how to create an encounter using the API. any reason why encounters can't be created through the API? we are a telehealth software that attends patients using virtual sessions but don't know how to proceed at this point without creating the encounters in the platform. thank you very much in advance for your help!</p>
