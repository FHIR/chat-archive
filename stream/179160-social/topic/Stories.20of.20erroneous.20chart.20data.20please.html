<p>ANSI has asked HL7 to comment on AI in healthcare. In the Patient Empowerment WG we're assembling a mini-white-paper about our concerns, ranging from transparency to the accuracy of the data being analyzed. </p>
<p>A key eye-popping component of such documents is true stories of bogus data. Such stories can help innocent minds understand the frailty of EMR data and the hazards of drawing conclusions from it.  </p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/100KcYfrJByJuEWplCbIzrHDBnn_adma3i7JY9lzTypg/edit#bookmark=id.ls79yas27q7z">User Stories section</a> in our draft document - please add some, if you have them.</p>

<p>I'm not an editor on that and cannot save my addition:<br>
Entwined records<br>
Two guys shared a house and found that they had the same name and same date of birth. Subsequently their medical and health insurance records became thoroughly confused for the time that they shared the house. They seem to have contributed to this out of a sense of fun.</p>

<p>I heard about this case too. I got the impression from the source that it stopped being fun once one of them got sick</p>
