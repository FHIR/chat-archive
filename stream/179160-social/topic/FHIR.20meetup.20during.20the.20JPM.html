<p>I would love to be there, to add a human touch to this overtly "all-about-the-money" investor event.  If anyone decides to have a spasm of sanity and provide some funding for a patient's expenses, let me know!</p>
<p>I could also try to arrange for some Bay Area patient activists to show up, if they could get in.</p>

<p>Dave, we are organizing a meetup at the time of the JPM but it is still a meetup, a forum for FHIR engineers to connect offline, not a commercial event. We will hopefully have 3-4 presentations on different subjects related to FHIR from representatives of different organizations. If you like to talk just let me know, we'd be glad to have you on the meetup.</p>

<p>The FHIR meetup schedule has been posted. Anish Arora will speak about common pitfalls in enterprise FHIR implementations and how to approach them pragmatically. Nick Radov will speak about payer/provider - interoperability use cases &amp; HL7 Da Vinci Project. Brendan Keeler will speak about why FHIR applications are still struggling in the wild and the main trust paradigms in healthcare.</p>
