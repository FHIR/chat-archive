<p>Hi all - I'm working with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="361177">@Hannah Wei</span> on her keynote Tuesday at the start of DevDays about Long COVID, "long-haulers," etc, and their battle against information silos that impede progress. </p>
<p><strong>I would love to have some feedback</strong> from folks who can help connect the dots from their needs to what the FHIR community (especially DevDays) might provide.  PM me (and/or Hannah) or discuss here.  We can share her draft talk with you, if you want.</p>
<p>Hannah is a leader of the LongCOVID <a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/">patient-led research group</a> that arose in the <a href="https://www.wearebodypolitic.com/covid19">18,000 member LongCOVID Slack community</a> on Body Politic, as written up in <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/12/1006602/covid-19-long-haulers-are-organizing-online-to-study-themselves/">MIT Technology Review in August</a> and in Ed Yong's <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/long-haulers-covid-19-recognition-support-groups-symptoms/615382/">potent piece in Atlantic</a>, aptly title and subtitled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Long-Haulers Are Redefining COVID-19</strong><br>
Without understanding the lingering illness that some patients experience, we can’t understand the pandemic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That subtitle is precisely what's at stake in Hannah's talk. The question is, how can the FHIR community help? </p>
<p>This is big stuff: the BMJ's August article <a href="http://bit.ly/BMJlong">http://bit.ly/BMJlong</a> with <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/370/bmj.m3026/F1.large.jpg">primary care guidance poster</a> has an Altmetric score (coverage in media &amp; social media) of nearly 5000, one of the highest scores ever despite being only 3 months old.</p>
<p>Again: how can FHIR help?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span> I would be interested in seeing Hannah's draft talk about COVID long-haulers. (Either PM me or linked here on the thread, whichever Hannah prefers). Thx.</p>
