<p>Anyone heard of this?  I learned about it Monday from Mitch Silva in Brussels ... he's about to become one of our newest fans &amp; participants.  It's an ISO Working Draft, updated Sept 2018. 777k PDF, 30 pages (body=16 pages, plus cases &amp; 30 refs), attached.</p>
<p>"Patient involvement in person-centred care"</p>
<p>From PDF page 5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Guiding principle</strong></p>
<p>This document aims to optimize the chances for improvement of health care outcome resulting from the<br>
meeting between the patient and the health care personnel/professionals, because it provides all<br>
involved stakeholders with a set of generic guidance points in order to provide minimum requirements<br>
of patient involvement in health care.</p>
<p>Strengthening the persons’ involvement and capacities to self-manage health and prevent illness is<br>
pivotal to policymakers’ attempts to achieve cost-containment with maintained or even improved<br>
quality of health care (2). To reach this goal, a systematic and structured system need to be in place to<br>
facilitates involvement in all steps of the persons' health care journey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven't dug deeper yet but I wonder if we ought to connect with them for any reason.  That question is above my pay grade!  I would just want to ensure that no ISO standard that gets encased in concrete with an obsolete concept of patient as a passive recipient of services.  (But maybe that's not in there.)</p>

<p>CORRECTION OCTOBER 11:   I was wrong to call it ISO; I'd been told that, but a wiser person pointed out it's from CEN, not ISO.  CEN is apparently a Europe-only standards body. </p>
<p>My interest in the subject remains:  to align ALL thinking about patient centricity, to achieve a paradigm. (Which Kuhn defines as agreement among practitioners in a field, without which a field can't advance.)</p>
