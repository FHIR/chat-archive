<p>I just stumbled across <a href="https://sci.chrismcculloh.com/2009/04/08/interesting-nytimes-article-on-emrs/written">a blog post</a> written in April 2009, shortly after the ARRA/HITECH act was passed, by a cousin of mine who was just entering medical school. He was 34 and had just left a career in information security..  In it, he links to an essay (<a href="https://sci.chrismcculloh.com/files/2009/04/mccullohc_emr_secondary_question.pdf">PDF</a>) he'd submitted in 2007 about the need for interop.</p>
<p>(Nastily, weeks before heading to medical school, he suffered a severe spinal cord injury and is paralyzed below the waist. But he persevered and is now a pediatric surgeon with a fellowship at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus OH. And I think <em>I</em> face obstacles in life...)</p>
