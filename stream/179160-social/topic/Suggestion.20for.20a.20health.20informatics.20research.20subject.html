<p>A question that arose for me out of social determinants of health consideration: What's the relationship between likelihood to believe in conspiracy theories and health outcomes? </p>
<p>Seems likely that there is one, but a very quick google showed far from sufficient research into this. A likely subject if some one is looking for a research subject ..</p>

<p>What's your hypothesis on a connection, Grahame? Stupidity / lack of careful thinking?</p>

<p>resistance to informed opinions, and refusal to do hard things</p>

<p>IMHO: Over focusing on some issues to the exclusion of other issues. I think that chain smokers who are fearful of the noise from wind farms while being comfortable about smoking have unusually selective attention.</p>
