<p>What do you make of this for elements with choice types like <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-medicationrequest-definitions.html#MedicationRequest.medication[x]">MedicationRequest.medication[x]</a>, which in the base specification can be a reference or a credible concept?  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191356">@Jenni Syed</span> mentioned this as a concern, indicating that possibly every branch of the choice would need to be exercised in testing. This doesn't seem logical to me because some of these things seem like modeling choices on the server side -- like whether to use codes or external resource references to represent the drug on a medication prescription.</p>

<p>There are more complicated choices. Like the vitals profile. We must support molecularSequence. We must also support SampleData. Because provenance must support patient as agent.who. Which means we must now support patient contributed data through the API. We are taking a conservative approach and planning on supporting all data types and must support choices because of ONC's interpretation.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I follow your logic here. The ONC  rule does not require a certified EHR to support patient generated observations or in fact any fhir create interactions. I mean it's great to see work happening in this domain, but I don't see how it is required by the regulations.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>  If ONC states we have to be able to show that we can return Provenance data with the agent.who as Patient, that would mean <em>something</em> had to be able to write data with that agent type.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> agree. But if ONC is going to test that you have data set a certain way, it has to have been possible to input that into the system. You're correct it's not going to test the write via the API, but it is going to test that they can read data that looks that way back out. Whether your system got that data in via an API or another native app, they won't care :)</p>

<p>Right. ONC Said that every must support element must be supported. When agent.who is a patient. How do you support a patient contributing data? They cannot log into to an EHR. That requires now the upstream EHR to support patient contributed data through some mechanism.</p>

<p>There's clearly a problem here. The US Core IG was never written to support this kind of testing; it's completely unreasonable to turn must-support as defined in the IG into 'must implement as a server'</p>

<p>Hi folks.<br>
One bureaucratic caveat: this is not an official guidance venue.<br>
For some upfront context and perspective, the quote from David Pyke at the beginning is nearly decade long regulatory policy and is not unique to FHIR or the recent API certification criterion (i.e., applies to certification for various V2 IGs, C-CDA, NCPDP SCRIPT standards all of which we have adopted in regulation).  Because we "incorporate by reference" standards/IGs, we have stated in every rule this general point to be clear that  unless we override a standard/IGs the stated requirements in a standard/IG apply.</p>
<p>So in this case, where the US Core IG has established requirements for servers, we have stated they will be in scope for testing to make expectations clear for health IT developers.</p>
<p>That said, if there are specific permutation handling concerns that would not make sense for a server to have to handle or other extrapolation examples, potentially like Drew's (if I follow) that would assume a scenario that would not be consistent with the stated conformance expectations (i.e., something that assumed upstream action for patient generated data as a write capability) then we are open to hearing about those and, as may be necessary or relevant, clarify testing scope or make adjustments.</p>
<p>But in collegial fairness and reciprocity, we need specific examples to inform those discussions in order to provide the clarifying scope changes.</p>

<p>Can you comment on the specifics (here or in another forum)  -- like, would testing protocols be expecting EHRs to expose patient-submitted data even though the US Core IG defines no API for patient data submission? Can ONC somehow be interpreting the FHIR "must support" flag in this way?</p>

<p>one specific point of contention is that, for instance, a reference is labelled as 'must-support', and this is interpreted to mean that all the possible things this is allowed to reference are therefore required to be implemented. We certainly do not have the ability to say that only some of those things make sense to be supported. </p>
<p>For a specific example, take the Lab diagnostic report profile. It labels <code>DiagnosticReport.performer</code> as 'must-support', and indicates that it can either be a US practitioner, or a US organization. Should a lab seek certification (I know this is not the current context), it makes no sense to require them to demonstrate that they can report a US practitioner as performer if their policy is that the lab as a whole is always the performer. The must-support applies to the performer reference. This is a very clear issue of a gap between what is intended and what is being tested</p>

<p>So <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> we have a process and a place where these types of determinations would be considered.  Depending on the nature of the clarification, it would either get put in the Certification Companion Guide (and if so also reflected in a Test Procedure) or just a Test Procedure.

<p>Appreciate the feedback and clarifications. Cerner has submitted feedback on this topic more than once and have received the same consistent feedback from ONC. Our next step was to log JIRAs for HL7 to consider changes to the IG and even redefining must support. I believe we also provided examples like MolecularSequence as being in scope for vitals testing because the core profile has that listed as a MustSupport element. SampleData is another example where our cardiology team has no idea what to do with it because we have never needed to capture that data.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191357">@Drew Torres</span> with (more) specific examples we may be able to more tightly review specific issues -- no promises though.

Perhaps to what Grahame said earlier there needs to be a new kind of "must-implement" or "always-implement" because clearly "must" is not cutting it for clarity.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> this is a similar concern I raised at an FMG meeting at the Sept WGM in 2018 when observation was going normative around the dangers of profile not fully vetted being called out on a normative resource. I believe there has been a stance that IGs must define “must-support”. When the IG says that a must support means that a server must store and retrieve, what does that mean in core? It makes absolutely no sense for the vitals-panel profile to point to molecular sequence, but because the definition of must-support in us-core is must implement.... I am now trying to figure out molecular sequence for vitals.</p>

<p>I'm not precisely following this. The FHIR specification does link to MolecularSequence from both <code>Observation.hasMember</code>, and <code>Observation.derivedFrom</code>. It does not use 'must-support' though - that is deferred to implementation guides that have context.</p>
<p>I note that the vital signs panel does label <code>Observation.hasMember</code> as must-support, but since there is no definition of must-support in the base FHIR specification, this is pretty much meaningless. In fact, the specification itself says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>no elements are flagged as mustSupport=true as part of the base specification</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's actually internally incoherent to label elements as must-support in the vital signs. you could certainly create a task to require us to sort this out. However that is resolved, though, as matter of technical clarification, any aspect of must-support-ness that arises from this applies to the element itself, not to the content of it's reference. </p>
<p>Turning to US core, I don't see that any of the Observation profiles in US core have either <code>Observation.hasMember</code>, and <code>Observation.derivedFrom</code> as 'must-support', so I don't know where any expectation of support for MolecularSequence arises - and it <em>certainly should not</em></p>

<p>The issue is that US-Core calls out the vital signs profile. Bringing into scope os certification the vitals signs profile. By the profile bring brought in, that must support element adopts the definition of must support of the profile.</p>

<p>I don't know what that means, actually, in a purely technical sense. Does that mean the profile <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/vitalspanel.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/vitalspanel.html</a>? or does it means all of them? Does the US Core definition of must-support automatically apply? I don't know that we've ever ruled on this. I would certainly remember that question.</p>
<p>But irrespective, the must-support relates to the element:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If true, implementations that produce or consume resources SHALL provide "support" for the <strong>element</strong> in some meaningful way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine. We have never said anything about implications for a reference, but had we done so, the vital signs panel would absolutely have said that the must-support relates to the member vital sign profiles</p>
