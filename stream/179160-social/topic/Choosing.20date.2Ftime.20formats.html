<p>Recently I was showing new members of my team the GForge system, so as to encourage them to raise quality issues on the FHIR content. As we are in the UK there is obviously a time difference and GForge is hosted in the US so we were just reminding staff of this. Additionally we have to remind staff on date formatting (mm/dd/yyyy not dd/mm/yyyy).</p>
<p>It was at this point it was pointed out to me that GForge has a very casual approach to dates (as per image). I guess if you can't standardise on one format then just use a variety. One HTML page with four different date/time formats.</p>
<p>I've used GForge for quite a while and never noticed. A fresh set of eyes saw it straight away.<br>
