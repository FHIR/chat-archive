<p>Hi from the Patient EMpowerment WG meeting. <br>
Jan Oldenburg notes that there's a 100 page section that has the core of the ONC rule, starting around page 1100. Where is it?</p>
<p>We're asking because HL7 asks all WGs to comment on what impact the Final Rules will have on them, by March 19. Can't read all 1700 pages.</p>

<p>The beginning of the PDF is 1100 pages of discussion of comments. These pages are NOT the rule. So skip them and read from 1100 on to read the rule.</p>

<p>But the official stuff is <em>dense</em> and written a set of "diffs" from previous regulations, so it's very hard to get a comprehensive picture of the results.</p>

<p>Thanks, but here's all it says on the <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/curesrule/what-it-means-for-me/patients" target="_blank" title="https://www.healthit.gov/curesrule/what-it-means-for-me/patients">What it means for patients</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ease of Access to Their Records</strong><br>
ONC's Cures Act Final Rule supports a patient's control of their health care and their medical record through smartphones and modern software apps.</p>
<p><strong>Protecting Patient Privacy and Security</strong><br>
The rule supports secure patient access to their electronic medical record data. Patients will be able to use applications they authorize to receive data from their medical records. OAuth 2 is used to authorize applications – the same highly secure protocol used on travel and banking apps.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting the Ability to Shop for Care and Manage Costs</strong><br>
ONC's Cures Act Final Rule looks to expand patient and payer choice in health care by increasing the availability of data that can support insights about care quality and costs. Much in the way apps have helped transparency in many industries such as online shopping, travel, and banking, they will be used to deliver information to patients and payers to assist in making decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems to me we'd need to know a lot more specifics than that, but maybe I'm wrong... <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191387">@Keith Boone</span>  what's your perspective?</p>

<p>Thanks, John.  I've been plowing through the PDF for a while, and oy, there is NO way for a layperson to tell where that starts. :-)  I'm going to guess it's at the bottom of page 1145 (exactly the last 100 pages), where it says this:<br>
**PART 170 – HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS, IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATIONS, AND CERTIFICATION CRITERIA AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS FOR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY<br>
**<br>
And yeah, as Josh says, it's indeed just a pile of edits / diffs / changes to previous rules. Utterly unreadable for a citizen like me. </p>
<p>So now, off to dig up (and place in this thread) the various pages ONC and CMS posted on Monday. Thanks all.</p>

<p>There's definitely outcomes of interest on the CMS side too -- apologies for suggesting otherwise. Re: ONC, I'm not suggesting you limit yourselves to the for-patient highlights; I'd review all of the fact sheets!</p>

<p>In the Federal Register it appears to be this 320 page PDF, which appears to still be hundreds of pages of discussion (comments and ONC responses), then perhaps the "diffs" that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>  mentioned back in March. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-05-01/pdf/2020-07419.pdf">https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-05-01/pdf/2020-07419.pdf</a>   But this is a mystery to me - where do I find the net-net-net?</p>
<p>The preliminary rule was 1100 pages, this one is 320...</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span> There is an executive summary at the top of the rule that typically outlines the provisions within the rule in just a few pages. Otherwise you could look to 3rd parties for their summaries.</p>

<p>Yeah, I've been doing that, and the third parties (and top of rule summary) are all too vague for what my buddy needs. So I may just have to leave it to him to satisfy himself :-)   Thanks!</p>
