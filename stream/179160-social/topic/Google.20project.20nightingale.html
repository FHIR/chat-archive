<p>"Google is teaming with one of the country's largest health-care systems on a secret project to collect and crunch the detailed personal health information of millions of Americans across 21 states, WSJ reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter and internal documents. From the report:<br>
The initiative, code-named "Project Nightingale," appears to be the largest in a series of efforts by Silicon Valley giants to gain access to personal health data and establish a toehold in the massive health-care industry. <a href="http://Amazon.com" target="_blank" title="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, Apple and Microsoft are also aggressively pushing into health care, though they haven't yet struck deals of this scope. Google launched the effort last year with St. Louis-based Ascension, the country's second-largest health system. The data involved in Project Nightingale includes lab results, doctor diagnoses and hospitalization records, among other categories, and amounts to a complete health history, complete with patient names and dates of birth."</p>

<p>The article doesn't indicate that any of the data is being linked to the other data that Google holds or that it's being tied into their advertising space.  If that <em>were</em> happening, then that would be a cause for alarm.  However, for Google to be applying their analytics capabilities to data from a health organization and feeding the results back into that health organization isn't a problem.  In fact, it's one of the things we're trying to enable - allowing third parties to define analytical algorithms, decision support processes, etc. that can consume data from others and provide useful advice/guidance.   <br>
 Few hospitals can afford to develop that expertise in-house and running the algorithms against larger data sets (even if partitioned) makes the algorithms better and less biased.</p>
<p>So long as the data aren't used for purposes they're not supposed to be and are kept appropriately segregated and the sharing is done within appropriate legal frameworks, there's no issue.</p>
<p>Now, if you don't <em>trust</em> Google (or Microsoft or Apple or Amazon or whomever) to adhere to the legal agreements they've signed, then you might have cause for anxiety.  But you should probably have even more anxiety about smaller organizations that also provide analytics services and aren't under nearly the same scrutiny as the big ones.</p>

<p>The concern is, as always should be considered, what happens when some intended and appropriate authorized use -- goes wrong. It is the failure-modes that are becoming more and more risky.  That is to say the likelihood might be well controlled, but the "harm" part of risk is becoming much more impactful when the data are healthcare data vs just browser behavior.  Reminder Risk is a function of ( likelihood, harm, detectability)</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with google advertising - it has to do with the widespread fear of leaks and misuse of data.  ESPECIALLY alarming to my advocate / activist friends is that the project was done in secret; note the Larry Page quote that suggests he knows better than individuals do what's good for them re use of their data.</p>

<p>Do you expect every hospital/clinic/payer/etc. to let you know when they contract outside help to analyze/secure/back-up/convert/otherwise manipulate your data?  It happens all the time and it's not considered to be "in secret" just because there's no notification to patients (or generally to staff).  John is correct that whenever outside access occurs, there are challenges around detectibility of mis-use.  And certainly the potential harm could be significant due to inappropriate use.  But allowing data to flow in authorized ways to create better knowledge and deliver better care is absolutely what we're trying to enable.  Whether that analysis is done by Google or by MomAndPopDataInc, due diligence is important to make sure that nothing untoward is happening to the data.  But we certainly don't want to prohibit all sharing where due diligence <em>is</em> being done just on the grounds that something bad could happen.</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing this up, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span>. </p>
<p>I think part of patient advocacy and activism should be to seek relevant information, and counteract wildly inaccurate speculations and fake news. The Guardian's piece refers to a video, which is total bunk. Google's Cloud business unit (just like AWS, Azure, Oracle Cloud) provides services to businesses where the data is most definitely segregated and not used in any of the their social networking/advertising business. Without that segregation, no one would be using these services.</p>
<p>Can this lead to problems, if something is misconfigured? Yes, just like it would happen if Ascension misconfigures a server or gets malware on their computers.</p>
<p>The only part that could be considered going beyond providing IT services to Ascension is the use of the data as source for machine learning. It sounds like this part of the agreement is far from started, and is still being figured out. The Google response is at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/our-partnership-with-ascension" target="_blank" title="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/our-partnership-with-ascension">https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/our-partnership-with-ascension</a>. It is probably a good starting point to identify what could be problematic and work constructively to address it (cf. John Moehrke's  function of ( likelihood, harm, detectability)).</p>

<p>Thanks, all.  I think Grahame hit the point correctly, and especially, why on EARTH would they be covert about this??  Why??</p>
<p>It certainly does them no good to say "We didn't ask you because we don't have to and you might say no."  That's precisely the situation in famous case a century ago that led to Informed Consent regulations (as foolish as they often are, in practice).  I surgeon removed a woman's uterus without asking, expressly because, he said, if he had asked her, she would have said no!  </p>
<p>Look, I'm no "anti-nerd." :-)  2/3 of how I got interested in the things that led me to FHIR are because I've worked with data all my life.  I have analyzed and harvested data, to create valuable patterns.  I got the Salesforce "Appy Award" in 2008 for effective use of Google AdWords in a marketing campaign that boosted our new-customer business 68% that year.  </p>
<p>I have not a single penny to earn or lose on this issue.  I'm just stomping around here trying to raise awareness of how sensitive this issue is.  </p>
<p>Aphorism that's nearly a battle cry in the patient world: Nothing about me without me.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I see press releases etc. The only sense in which they are being covert is that they didn't ask for patient consent, and that's because they're doing this is as a BAA - no different to any other data processing service. So no notification needed. I suspect congress will revisit the question of just what it is that can be done under a BAA fairly soon</p>
<p>It is interesting how this plays out differently in countries that don't have anything like HIPAA....</p>

<p>What does "covert" mean?  HL7 "shares personally identifying information of its members and everyone who interacts with its issue tracking system, wiki pages and Confluence system with Microsoft and/or Google" - i.e. we leverage cloud services from both organizations.  </p>
<p>We didn't ask anyone's permission to do that.  And the only reason you'll likely see any press releases about it is because Google and Microsoft have provided those services to us for free and we wanted to give them some good press.</p>

<p>Furthermore (not related to Google), there is an evil entity called the MIB that collects data about individuals into a profile. Outrage erupted over their marketing (a now-deleted cartoon with a literal price tag on a woman's arm), telling insurers that the MIB would warn them about individuals who are a bad risk. That cartoon is no longer anywhere to be found on the web, AFAIK.

<p>Right.  So one of our functions as a patient work group should be to come up with a checklist to look at when reading stories like this to see if there's something that the community really <em>should</em> get up in arms about or whether this is a relatively safe (and perhaps even desirable) form of data sharing.</p>

<p>We have very good reason to not trust what's in the chart, nor what downstream companies MAY do with it.  Our vigilance is not just the kind of naivete that Larry Page (classic young / healthy SiliValley white guy) thinks is our problem.</p>

<p>We have the opposite problem (in the UK). I constantly get grief over the fact that if a family member goes to a hospital then the hospital can't get the records from the GP (or vice versa). It is technically possible (&amp; will be rectified over time ) but the main blocker is the old "who owns the data" chestnut. My position is that it is the patient but that view is only slowly being adopted.  In this case the health co clearly believes it is "its data".</p>

<p>I think it's a little more complicated than that. A clinician getting access (e.g. UK GP Connect) to a record is a low IG request but NHS(D) asking for a copy of the records is a high IG request (e.g. UK GP Data).<br>
As a patient I'd be asking why you need a copy of my records? It's this copy that health co, gp's and patients have issue with, they probably don't have many issues with the research questions being asked [It's the method of getting access to the data that's the big issue]</p>

<p>I think any illegality under GDPR would be limited to "purpose of use".  If the patients involved had authorized their data to be used for the purpose of research on new predictive analytics to improve care delivery, would GDPR prohibit contracting another organization to do the analytics research if the organization was contractually behaving as a subsidiary and restricted from retaining the data or making any other use of the data once the research was complete?  I can't imagine the nightmare in Europe if you had to get patient permission every time you wanted to sub-contract a data analytics or maintenance function to another organization.  Obviously it would be essential that the contracted organization be bound to the same GDPR expectations as the contracting organization.</p>
<p>I can certainly see value in giving a machine learning algorithm a patient's full name.  If one of the things it's doing is checking for potential errors in data (e.g. incorrect merges), then any anonymization algorithm that was applied to the data could corrupt/interfere with the machine learning process.  The only way it being 'Google' matters is that Google potentially has other business interests in the use of the data, so the terms of the agreement (and the oversight of the agreement) would need to ensure that the shared data was only used for its authorized purpose.  In practice, that should be done regardless of who the contracted organization is.  It's pretty clear that the agreement here does have those constraints in place, though it's not totally clear what oversight mechanisms exist.</p>

<p>You would need to inform them at least, so they can apply for their ARCO rights. I'm pretty sure it could be done as long as contingency plans, intended usage, etc. are clearly stated and patients are informed. Not informing the patients is the worst offender in this case IMHO.</p>

<p>Right.  GDPR requires purpose of use permission.  The US does not.  Analyzing data to improve quality, delivery, outcomes and/or efficiency is considered part of 'operations'.  So this would presumably also be fine in Europe without patient notification so long as the initial data capture was done informing the patient that their data could be used as part of analysis to improve quality, delivery, outcomes and/or health system efficiency.  The fact that Google might be doing the actual work would never need to be disclosed to the patients and no further permission on their part would be needed.</p>

<p>I'll just add a quick note that two separate, co-equal concerns are woven through this topic: what's legal in different places, and the perceptions / concerns different people have.</p>
<p>I'll never assert that we have to "solve" people's worries, whatever that would mean. But if we care about adoption, we do need to be conscious of it.</p>

<p>Part of the challenge is that people aren't aware that data sharing happens all the time and <em>must</em> happen for the system to function.  Just as most people don't host their own email servers, hospitals are going to rely on external organizations to manage some of their data operations.  Patients aren't going to be notified when that happens because it's not practical or reasonable to do so.  What matters is whether the data being shared is shared with appropriate protections and appropriate oversight.  That's the bit that matters - not whether patients had a say in the sharing.  (I understand the arguments for patients having some say in how their information is used/benefit from use that may provide others with commercial value, but that's neither law nor cultural expectation in the U.S.)</p>

<p>Just want to add a note from discussion elsewhere: it seems that the basic motivation for the whistleblower is that the existing HIPAA requirements (which the whistleblower believed were appropriate) weren't being conformed to by the Google team - at least to the degree that they believed that Google had not done sufficient internal training around compliance. </p>

<p>Well said. This could be a pinned/sticky post representing the (perhaps) "informed fear"? felt by many patients.  </p>
<p>I will say too that while "espionage" of one sort or another may be common in different industries, there's a nasty immoral taste to it when someone's being snoopy and careless (hello Zuck and Protti) with what may be intensely personal information. </p>
<p>A health-related aspect that's not present in most industries: in some cases if someone fears having a fact leak out, they don't pursue therapy. That's both inhuman (a complete system failure, eh?) and dangerous to "the herd" as well, if it's contagious. </p>
<p>Security really is fundamental in healthcare.</p>

<p>Thanks, Grahame.   I did a quick scan and found two causes for concern: "private / privacy" gets only a passing nod ("Yeah, health data is personal"), and there's not a word about patient consent.  </p>
<p>So, so far this seems to have worrying signs of "We're not listening" or "Don't think about that - think about this," neither of which will fly well with the people who are concerned.  </p>
<p>Note: I did not just say "Fail!  I hate this man!"   I'm pointing to the things that are recurring red flags when a company like Google or FB wants to pave over the issue. </p>

<p>I'm not clear why patient consent would be required here (ignoring for the moment whether regulations require that or not - which in this case I don't believe they do).</p>
<p>The objective isn't to mine the patient's data to extract knowledge (where you might theoretically say that patients have a right to compensation).  The objective is just to learn to better integrate and present the data the health provider has from different sources.  I.e. The purpose of use of the data is consistent with why the data was originally captured - present it to appropriate clinicians at the appropriate time to support the delivery of patient care.  If the Ascension was doing this themselves, patient consent certainly wouldn't be required.  It's not reasonable to seek patient consent every time a healthcare provider outsources an IT function - which it appears is all that's happening here.  Patients certainly should expect that appropriate data custody and protections are in place when outsourcing occurs, but the parties claim that has happened here.  (I recognize the whistle-blower seems to disagree, so totally understand feeling some trepidation about what's actually happening.)</p>

<p>Yes, "consent" is not technically the right word. I'll try to come up with better wording and edit the post. </p>
<p>The concern a lot of people have (note, I'm not stamping MY feet here) is that the company is tone deaf about the issue; you don't need to be a genius to anticipate the response to headlines about "Google" plus "millions of patient records."</p>
<p>Again, as I said up-thread, my main point is that we (the FHIR community) need to be aware of public sensitivity about this.  I think there's a chance for our community to be true leaders on this subject in the public's eye ... nobody ever gained trust by simply saying "Oh, don't worry about that." :-)</p>

<p>The unfortunate problem is that the best word the access control and legal community have for this is "Policy" which happens to be the same word they use for everything. There is some interest (2 people) to have a solution for encoding a policy for how data can be used and what obligations are placed on that use, so that a recipient of data have the rules in a processible form (not paper) to better enable appropriate use and avoid accidental (or malicious) misuse.</p>

<p>Thanks, all.  I think Grahame hit the point correctly, and especially, why on EARTH would they be covert about this??  Why??</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a common business practice to protect customer relationships.<br>
1. Not every business that does work with other businesses publicizes their customer list.  Who your customers are is intellectual property, and not everyone shares who their customers without some thought being but into it.<br>
2. Other vendors I've worked with in the past don't and won't tell the public who their customers are except in special circumstances.<br>
3. Some customers prefer to not have it known who they use for certain services in BAA and similar arrangements.  That may expose how they provide value add to their competitors.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons why this sort of information isn't commonly publicized.  Do you know who you provider uses to connect to your insurer?  B/c they likely use a service to do it.  Do you know who your HCP uses to handle their billing?  They likely don't do it themselves.  A lot of these functions are outsourced to organizations that specialize in that function, and can therefore take advantage of economies of scale that aren't available to the single organization that needs that function.</p>
<p>Should there be different rules for BIG names like Ascension or Google with regard to publication of this sort of relationship?  Why?</p>
<p>FWIW: For Google, and any other, this activity has to be firewalled from activities in other parts of the business, and very likely, separate business entities have to be created to ensure that firewall is strong.  I strongly suspect that Google wholly owns the company that does the work, and that company has access to Google technology and services, but that the reverse is not true with regard to the data that organization has access to.<br>
A similar thing happens to healthcare systems which also provide their own healthcare plans, and there's a lot of attention on these sort of relationships to ensure that private data remains accessibly only to the entity that provides the service (healthcare, or insurance).</p>
