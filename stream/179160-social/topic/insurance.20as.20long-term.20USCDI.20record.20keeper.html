<p>Second, as a matter of design philosophy, IMO there's strong reason to put such custodianship in the hands of a party/actor who has strong incentive to make sure it's right, and I have zero confidence that people who think of themselves as "payers" give a rat's patoot about whether the patient's interests are being served.</p>
<p>If our objective is to make the data collecting easy, then we give the task to thee party who's everywhere. If our priority is to make sure it's donee carefully and accurately, we give it to the party who's in a position to do that. Typically, the patient and/or his/her delegate.</p>
