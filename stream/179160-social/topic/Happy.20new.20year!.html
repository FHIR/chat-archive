<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192681">@Espen Stranger Seland</span>, happy new year!<br>
In December, I have been working on updating the snapshot generator logic in the (open source) .NET API library to R4. This work is mostly finished, except for handling of choice types, which I'm going to focus on now. Once the API has been fully updated to R4, I will start working on creating a new Forge application release for R4. Updating the Forge UI will also require a a bit of non-trivial work, as breaking changes in <code>ElementDefinition.type</code> require us to redesign and re-implement the associated UI components. I've never been quite satisfied with the way element types are represented in the Forge UI, so I'd like to take this opportunity and see if we can improve this (important) aspect of the UI. Patience please...<br>
The Forge R4 release will be published as a separate install package that can be intalled side-by-side next to Forge DSTU2 and/or STU3 releases on the same machine.</p>
