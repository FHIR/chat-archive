<p>Hi all, I'm a veterinary informaticist working for VCA (a large hospital and lab services provider in the companion animal domain).  I understand that veterinary involvement in FHIR has been pretty light so far, and I'm hoping to promote FHIR use within the profession (as there is fairly poor standards adoption industry-wide, largely due to the lack of consumer or government pressure to do so). Incidentally, the Association for Veterinary Informatics (<a href="http://avinformatics.org" target="_blank" title="http://avinformatics.org">http://avinformatics.org</a>) is the best single place to find informatics-savvy veterinarians, if that is helpful. Anyway, glad to be participating. Thanks for pointing me here, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>.</p>

<p>Welcome :)  If you find anything that you don't think meets the needs of the veterinary community, please holler.</p>

<p>Great timing <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="195400">@Dennis Ballance</span>  I was just at WVC and approached all the practice management software vendors and urged them to take a peek at FHIR.  I got middling responses as you may expect.  But I hoped to at least plant the seed.  I must admit I didn't even know there was a Veterinary informatics out there.</p>

<p>A FHIR talk at a Fetch conference would be a great place to start.</p>

<p>and I must admit I failed to stop by the VCA booth at WVC</p>

<p>Not to worry - VCA software dev isn't represented at the booth anyway. ;) I am going to push for VCA to take a leadership role in this. I also will be talking to Banfield next week, so between us we may be able to kick start some adoption.  </p>
<p>A couple years ago a few of us put together a green CDA version of a radiology report for telemed companies to use to share content. Nobody has implemented it, but I'm working on a JSON/FHIR-based sample doc, which I hope to hand off to Antech Imaging Services.</p>
