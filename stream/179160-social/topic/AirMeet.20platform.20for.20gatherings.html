<p>I've just attended a virtual birthday party using <a href="https://www.airmeet.com/">AirMeet</a>. It was an astounding experience, with "tables" (small "breakout rooms"), "lounges," as well as presentations. Anyone else used it?? </p>
<p>At first blush I'd say it's an order of magnitude more like the live DevDays experience than anything I've seen, including serendipitous "bumping into" people unexpectedly.</p>

<p>thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span> i just looked into it a little, and not sure we could use it for a meeting (some initial things, only 16 speakers are allowed for an event, no integrations yet), but certainly something that could used at an event for social interactions.  I will have to get a demo from them to investigate more.</p>

<p>I'm impressed (but not surprised) that you noticed so quickly!</p>

<p>16 speakers will surely limit their market massively</p>

<p>We've talked a bit about <a href="https://gather.town">https://gather.town</a> for similar purposes; we used it in the SMART track at the last connectathon to pretty good effect. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194993">@Sandra Vance</span> and I have talked about how this sort of functionality could help folks self-organize and capture a bit more of the spirit from in-person events.</p>
