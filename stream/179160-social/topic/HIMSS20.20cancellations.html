<p>So, aside from Cisco, Amazon and Salesforce, who else do you know that has cancelled?  I'm no longer going but some sales people from my company are.  </p>
<p>Who's no longer going?</p>

Cisco<br>
HL7<br>
Humana<br>
Intel<br>
Lumiata<br>
Salesforce<br>
Siemens Healthineers<br>
TriNetX<br>
VMware supposedly won’t attend.<br>
Microsoft is reportedly debating internally whether to attend.<br>
Providence and Multicare reportedly will keep registrants home.<br>
An anonymous reader says their healthcare organization has suspended all business travel for four weeks.<br>
Medicomp will not exhibit (that comes from Medicomp directly).<br>
HP is reportedly not exhibiting.<br>
MITRE is said to have cancelled attendance plans. (update: now verified via Twitter).<br>
Cleveland Clinic reportedly won’t participate.<br>
A reader says EClinicalWorks is notifying people who are scheduled for meetings that it won’t attend.</p>
<p>I'm aware of a few other payers who either aren't attending or are significantly reducing attendance.  Not sure if that's shareable though.<br>
Also, from HISTalk:<br>
From Need to Stay Anonymous: “Re: HIMSS20. HIMSS asked our national, well-known company not to publicize or reveal that we aren’t going to HIMSS20, but rather to say that ‘we are participating at a reduced level’ if asked and without making any public statements. The concern is the optics – HIMSS can’t cancel because this is their main (almost only) revenue stream and having ONC and President Trump means the HHS people are forced to attend. The organizations I know will set up their booths, let them be empty, and attend only the panels where they are presenting and then leave.” Unverified.</p>

<p>With 3 potential trips to the USA this year, I took your advice and checked all the exclusions in my annual Air NZ Policy. I didn't find anything relating to states of emergency but, IF the World Health Organisation officially declares the COVID-19 outbreak to be a Pandemic, I wouldn't be covered for any related medical expenses in the USA which, of course, is an absolute show-stopper.</p>

<p>Similar to mine...<br>
“Epidemic” means a fast-spreading contagious or infectious disease or illness in an area as documented by a recognised public health authority.<br>
“Pandemic” means an Epidemic that is expected to affect an unusually large number of people or involves an extensive geographic area.<br>
Guess that the definition of 'recognised public health authority' is the key.  For an epidemic in NZ, that would be the Ministry of Health - for a pandemic, the WHO.</p>

<p>The cancellation notice indicated that a decision on refunds was up to 2 weeks away - I expect that will include figuring out how much insurance will cover, how much they'll be out for venue and other costs and how much they need to remain viable until next year.  I expect the odds of a full refund or full carry-over to next year are slim.</p>

<p>As a first-time attendee, that will be a sour experience to have them take my money and cancel the event with no refund.  I had a mixed view of HIMSS before, and will be vocal critic if they don’t offer a refund.</p>

<p>Quote from a Dutch travel insurance policy (my translation) "healthcare costs will not be covered  in case that the insured party could have known that travel carried a significant risk (to the health of the insured party)". Examples listed are: if a region/country is on the Dutch government travel-destination black list (e.g. China, northern Italy). Whether the fact of a US state declaring an emergency is  sufficient  to trigger the "insured party could have known that travel carried a significant risk" clause is anybody's guess.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="223704">@Mary Ann Boyle</span>, from my terms and conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Epidemic” means a fast-spreading contagious or infectious disease or illness in an area as documented by a recognised public health authority.</p>
<p>We will not pay for:<br>
2. claims under Section 2.3 and 2.5 arising from an Epidemic, Pandemic or outbreak of an infectious disease or any derivative or mutation of such viruses, or the threat or perceived threat of any of these.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's unclear what a recognised public health authority is. But the insurance company confirmed for that that Florida's state of emergency qualifies</p>

<p>FWIW someone at our office called our (Canadian) corporate travel health insurance provider today and got conformation that the US state of emergency does -not- mean we aren't covered.</p>

<p>In insurance terms, COVID-19 became a 'known event' in late January and that, of itself, will trigger many exclusion clauses in policies taking effect after that date. I'd say that, in practical terms, the chances of a NZ insurance company paying out in respect of any such claims is pretty low, regardless of whether a US State Governor classifies &lt;5 coronavirus infections as an 'emergency'.</p>
