<p>OMG <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196484">@Joshua Procious</span> why on EARTH is this resource-packed page called <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FA/FHIR+accelerator+home">Accelerator Home</a>??  I can see that it's targeted at Accelerator people, which I'd define as "Motivated people who are new to HL's byzantine ways".  Guess what: our Patient Engagement WG has a bunch of people who fit that definition too. <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span> </p>
<p>Maybe call it Newcomer Home, or Welcome Newcomer, or HL7 Newcomer Orientation?  Or "Feel lost? Want some maps?" :-) </p>
<p>HT <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="225094">@Debi Willis</span> for finding this!   I imagine <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> and others will be happy that we may need less WG time for such things.</p>

<p>It was mentioned on the recent HL7 Member Update Webinar and a light bulb went off in my head :) <a href="https://www.pathlms.com/hl7/courses/21438/video_presentations/164979">https://www.pathlms.com/hl7/courses/21438/video_presentations/164979</a>     I could see where it would benefit any newcomer.</p>

<p>Agree - I was only tweaking the ever-helpful-and-capable <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196484">@Joshua Procious</span> , with a side order of "Maybe this could actually be a useful idea <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span> </p>
<p>I'm certainly going to remember this as a go-to for new members.</p>

<p>Hello Dave! Your point is well received and although I did create this page and have done work on it, I am not the one responsible for its naming. If the community would like this changed to a more inclusive name, I'm happy to do so. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191759">@Melva Peters</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="295811">@Ken McCaslin</span> have done most of the work here so perhaps they would be helpful on input as to how its name could be changed? </p>
<p>Now as far as getting the word out, with name as is or not, that's a great idea. I will discuss with Melva on how we may roll this out so that workgroups have more visibility!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196484">@Joshua Procious</span> Hi Dave, I'll discuss this with Wayne and see what we can do - the page was developed for the Accelerators in mind so they have a place they can go to find information and some of the content on it is intended for the Accelerators.  We have been promoting it as a place to go to get information.  I'm glad you found it and find it useful.</p>
