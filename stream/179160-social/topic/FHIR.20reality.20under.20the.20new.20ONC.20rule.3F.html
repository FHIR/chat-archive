<p>Googling is failing me here.  Somebody in the US - <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191387">@Keith Boone</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196361">@Ryan Howells</span> or anyone - what has become of the much-discussed ONC rule, due out this month (when?), that mandates using FHIR?</p>
<p>Did the rule go live? Has anything real changed as a result?  (I don't expect instant transformation - just asking)</p>

<p>Not yet, not even at OMB.  My current shot and beer bet with Josh is after 12/24/2019.  He thinks before that, but not by much.  Since it isn’t yet in OMB hands, 6 weeks is about early as it could show up.</p>

<p>For health plans and claims data, on 9/26 the CMS rule went to OMB (<a href="https://reginfo.gov/public/do/eoDetails?rrid=129598" target="_blank" title="https://reginfo.gov/public/do/eoDetails?rrid=129598">https://reginfo.gov/public/do/eoDetails?rrid=129598</a>) which means typically it will take less than 60 days before it's finalized <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span> . My guess is the CMS rule will be finalized in mid-late December. As <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191387">@Keith Boone</span> notes, the ONC rule isn't at OMB yet. Likely, that means they are still struggling with issues like eHI, HINs, etc.</p>

<p>At OMB as of End of October, and HLTH2019 in Vegas, someone heard Don Rucker say that it would be out by end of year.  OMB has been processing rules in 2018 in about 9 weeks (slight over 60 days), so it could happen, but my bet (by a very slight margin) is that ONC won't ruin Christmas this year.  It's really out of their hands except that if someone in HHS wants to push OMB to put a hurry up they could.  I'm betting the CMS rule won't come out before the ONC rule (because of tight links between the two), but it's been OMB hands for a month longer.</p>
