<p>This is really aimed at the Patient Empowerment group (I'll link to it there) but I want more eyes on it initially.</p>
<p>To tickle the interest of potential patient innovators, we ought to create a webinar that walks through everything on <a href="https://fire.ly/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CHEAT_SHEET_R4_MAY_2019_v1.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://fire.ly/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CHEAT_SHEET_R4_MAY_2019_v1.pdf">Firely's one-page cheat sheet PDF</a>.  Who would help do that?</p>
<p>Caution: I have very strong instincts about how this ought to work, but I can't articulate them yet. :-)  Briefly, each thing should have a short definition (doesn't need to be super-precise) and a brief demonstration of what it looks like in practice.  </p>
<p>Or maybe this is an endless series of "Your weekly FHIR tidbit" webinars.  I don't know.  I just know I hunger to be able to help people see what it looks like when you can get data far more easily than ever before.</p>

<p>Be aware that the cheat sheet defines things that may not be widely supported.  We should probably focus on the commonly supported stuff first.</p>

<p>Yes especially the operations are not widely supported. Further, the cheat sheet describes <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html</a> and <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html</a> (both basic and more advanced stuff). Next to that, some common data structures and CodeSystem URIs. </p>
<p>If anyone has suggestions for things to add or remove, please let me know. I'm the one who maintains the cheat sheet.</p>

<p>I'm guessing Dave isn't talking about an exhaustive walkthrough (even in our 2-day FHIR training course we don't cover absolutely everything on the cheatsheet, some things are quite exotic), but one can pick an example from each 'area' of the cheatsheet and show what it's about / how it's used. If we have a patient use case, the explanation could be tied into it.</p>

<p>Exactly!  Thank you <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191372">@René Spronk</span> for expressing my thoughts more clearly than I do. :-)</p>
<p>I am continuously learning that this is a highly technical and engaged audience, which has much higher standards for things like "walk-through" than the consumer/patients I'm trying to attract and educate. :-)</p>

<p>With FHIR, you've got to do hands-on. Ideally we'd need a no-frills web page that allows one to do a POST. GET means simply typing a URL in a browser, but a PUT/POST requires some sort of minimalistic tool. Postman is much too complex for this.</p>

<p>Yeah - it has gotten harder to use as they have added functionality to it. I could easily add a page to clinFHIR if you haven;t already created such a page...</p>

<p>Good too see you overestimate my programming skills ;-) .. if you could whip up a page I'd be much obliged. Please hard code a public FHIR server. Auto detect XML or JSON to set the correct headers. Should probably display the raw response as well... but you know all of that.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span> ,  I think this is a great suggestion. Who can follow-through on this?  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> ?  Lloyd mentioned the idea of recording some short useful educational modules for newcomers.  Maybe we could find someone willing to do an overview explanation of the material on the FHIR Cheatsheat, and then record them while providing this helpful education. This would create a resource that would benefit lots of people who come behind us.</p>

<p>Some of the CheatSheet content is pretty deep, but covering some of it/key points would be apropriate</p>

<p>Right - because the current cheat-sheet is aimed at a totally different audience. This would be aimed at patients with zero prior knowledge of FHIR and/or REST. IMHO that'd have to be part infographic, part examples anyone could run in any web browser, part reference/cheat-sheet like. To make it relevant for the average citizen you'd need to add national-specific stuff (for example: Argonaut, SMART on FHIR, relevant regulations in the US, or MedMij in the Netherlands, or the Finnish PHR in Finland).</p>

<p>Yes yes yes, absolutely 100% on target!</p>
