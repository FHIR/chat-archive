<p>I spent about 4 years in mid 90's playing around with informatics and coding systems... it was very hard and eventually I drifted off and became an anaesthetist instead... since finishing my training I played around in LAMP stacks and more recently in angularjs on non-medical projects. Coming back to informatics (now I have a bank of study leave the hospital owes me) after a solid 15 year break is really interesting. The thing that is obvious is the many 1000s of hours that people have put in to advance the conceptual frameworks and mapping them to modern technology. So even though I've been poking at some of the soft spots just wanted to say that FHIR is amazing! </p>
