<p>Things keep changing: right now, the connectathon will go ahead (physically in Brussels, and virtually). The plugathon on Tuesday/Wednesday will be taking place, the side events on Thursday and Friday have been cancelled. Belgian employees of healthcare provider organizations are no longer allowed to attend conferences and other (large) meetings (according to the Belgian federal healthcare ministry).</p>

<p>it's pretty certain that the San Antonio HL7 meeting won't be a physical meeting; instead we'll be working on a virtual replacement (but not yet formally announced, so not totally certain)</p>

<p>That may be when the decision gets blessed, but I think it's safe to say that in practical terms, the decision is made.  No one will physically travel to it, even if they're in one of the few places that still allow travel at that point.  It's virtual or nothing.</p>

<p>I pretty much agree - as far as I can tell, though this is not my speciality - we will deeply regret waiting to do this. We've seen the models playing out in real life (other countries have tested them for us at immense cost) and we know enough to act. but will we?</p>

<p>If I was running policy for Australia right now, here's what I would be doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>throwing <em>everything</em> I could at testing (I see people claiming Tom Hanks could get tested because he's in Australia, but in fact people around me can't get tested without significant risk factors)</li>
<li>beefing up the healthcare system as fast as I can, and very publicly at that</li>
<li>shutting down society as much as I can without endangering the supply lines that maintain people's lives</li>
<li>building infrastructure to allow the country to enforce social distancing using apps </li>
</ul>
<p>What we are doing here (and some things are being done), and is being done in UK and USA - where I'm connected enough to know - is 2-3 weeks behind the curve. People are going to die because we didn't.</p>

<p>I'm afraid this thread is wherever you want it to be. <br>
It's difficult to hear the rational argument sometimes, for example the Netherlands wants schools for under 12 year olds to stay open, stating that a) children are a very low risk group, and there are no known cases of child to adult transmission, and b) closing schools would force parents to remain home, which is a major (additional/unnecessary) disruption (also for healthcare workers and other essential services). <br>
Is this a wise move? I'm not an expert, and non-experts tend to wish to clamp down everything. It's been too long ago that we (as humans) had an epidemic like this, and it's near to impossible to compare the flu epidemics of 1918 or 1957 to the current day and age.</p>

<p>clearly keeping schools open or not is going to be a flash point in the next little while; epidemiology from previous epidemics shows that closing schools saved lives, but the characteristics of this virus are quite different.  I don't know how schools in Netherlands work, but the primary issue is the mixing of adults that schools engender.</p>
