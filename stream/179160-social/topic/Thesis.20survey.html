<p>Hi all! For anyone who has worked on a digital health project/product in <strong>Berlin-Brandenburg</strong> in the past or present (or is/was living there), I'd like to invite you to participate in a survey for my bachelor thesis! I hope it's alright to post this here, let me know if otherwise.</p>
<p>The survey topic is your awareness and experiences with innovation methodologies in digital health product creation. It is anonymous and takes roughly 15 minutes. <a href="https://afatykhova.eu.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank" title="https://afatykhova.eu.pythonanywhere.com/">https://afatykhova.eu.pythonanywhere.com/</a></p>
