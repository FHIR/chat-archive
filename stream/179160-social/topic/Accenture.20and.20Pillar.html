<p>I just learned from this article: <a href="https://annarborusa.org/accenture-expands-industry-x-0-capabilities-with-two-acquisitions-in-north-america/" target="_blank" title="https://annarborusa.org/accenture-expands-industry-x-0-capabilities-with-two-acquisitions-in-north-america/">https://annarborusa.org/accenture-expands-industry-x-0-capabilities-with-two-acquisitions-in-north-america/</a>  that Accenture has outright bought Pillar Technology (headquartered in Ann Arbor, MI, and Columbus, Oh).  I'd like to share congratulations with all involved as I have a great respect for both companies.  My best friend Amitai Schlair (<a href="http://agilein3minut.es/" target="_blank" title="http://agilein3minut.es/">http://agilein3minut.es/</a>) worked at Pillar for a few years.  I have a few acquaintances there and even interviewed there myself (The bar is high!).  Along with Duo Security, Pillar Technology has led the way for Agile Software Development and innovation where I live in Ann Arbor.  I know this probably sounds commercial-y, but I truly believe that Pillar does so many things right that I look forward to seeing the results of the Accenture purchase. Congrats to all involved!</p>
