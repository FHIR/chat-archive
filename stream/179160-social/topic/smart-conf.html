<p>SMART and HSPC are working together to put on a Developers Conference potentially as soon as this fall. As the name implies, this conference will be geared towards developers. We'll run sessions and panels with EHR vendors, developers, and FHIR community leaders, in order to help you:</p>
<p>Learn about current and future EHR support for SMART on FHIR<br>
Learn about tools and services that help you build SMART on FHIR apps<br>
Discover the business side of getting apps into production (validation, contracts, etc.)<br>
Network with other Health IT application and platform developers</p>
<p>Before we officially announced this conference, we wanted to reach out to this community to better understand our audience. We'd love your help in completing a brief survey to register your interest. </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192542">@Lindsay Morsillo</span> After reviewing the result of the survey we see that there is a great deal of interest, but the short time to get travel approved and arranged seems to be a problem for a lot of potential attendees, so we are postponing to early 2017 and are currently researching the best date to hold the conference. </p>
