<p>Ai2, the Accelerator for Informatics Innovation, is once again hosting the AMIA 2019 Pitch IT competition, and entries are now being accepted at challenge.Ai2.world.  The event will occur during the AMIA Annual Symposium in Washington DC on November 17.  The session has been expanded this year to include real-world stories from past winners on what it takes to be an entrepreneur in healthcare today, and the opportunity to meet and hear from a panel of industry leaders on how they work with startups. These will be followed by what is sure to be a lively pitch competition from our five finalists, competing for $25,000 in prizes.</p>
