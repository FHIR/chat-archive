<p>Hi, I am a FHIR Developer and now have a question about the search query.<br>
I would like to know how to get data in referenced resources. for example, I searched for encounter resources over last 1 year and the outcome was 100 encounter resources in a search-set bundle. And each of the resources refers patient and practitioner resource. Then, as I think the number of total connections to obtain all the encounter resources with individual patient and practitioner name is 201. Because 1 connection to get search set bundle, 100 connections to get each patient name and 100 connections to get each practitioner name as they all are referred. I believe this is very inefficiency and there is a solution for this case. If anyone knows, please help me</p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192529">@joonggeon lee</span> quoting my esteemed collegue <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> This would typically be an implementer thread topic rather than social stream (for next time). If you can share an example of your search query in you're posting and under the Implementer Thread many FHIR folks may be able to help you more.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192529">@joonggeon lee</span> Look at the _include parameter on the search page.</p>
