<p>I like the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) model the best. It's divided in legal, organisational, semantic and technical interoperability (split into some more layers for eHealth). Even politicians can understand it, a point for some of us.</p>

<p>there are multiple guides that require code sets that require a license - NCPDP codes, X12 codes, ISBT codes, etc.  To be clear, the actual exchange of the codes does not require a license, but having the full set of codes and their relationships does require a license.  I suppose SNOMED would be similar.  That is obviously different from requiring a proprietary tool however.</p>

<p>+1 to Jean.  It's typical and expected with terminologies.  But mandating a proprietary tool would violate our vendor independence principle.  Typically mandating use of a specific tool - even a free open-source one - is not specified in an HL7 standard.</p>

<p>We work very hard to ensure that international standards are free-to-use, so for example, with FHIR, we prohibit mandating the use of SNOMED or other non-free terminologies unless the codes (and anything necessary to use them in implementations) has been made freely available by SNOMED International.  (They have done so for some of the terminologies used in International Patient Summary, for example.)  For U.S. specific standards, where regulation already mandates the use of non-free terminologies, HL7 implementation guides will use them.  And where a terminology is 'free for use' in the jurisdiction due to national license agreements, those are fair game too.  However, if you're looking at introducing the use of something that isn't already required by regulation or free for use, then you should try to find another solution or seek vetting from the TSC.</p>

<p>Thanks to all.  <em>IF</em> (if!) I understand correctly, the situation that came up today was a proprietary / fee-based place to store and access a patient's document.  I'll try to confirm and will reply here later.

<p>I doesn't seem like there was ever a resolution to the discussion 2 years ago, but HIMSS is definitely leveraging their interoperability definition and maturity model widely, including their involvement with GDHP and the Global Consortium for eHealth Interoperability (which is a new collaboration with IHE and HL7).  If we wanted to see some modifications to the definition, I could bring that up thru the Consortium.</p>

<p>Sorry for not being more clear, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> ... when the topic I described arose yesterday I searched zulip for 'definition of interop' to see if there was any existing answer, and ran across this thread.  </p>
<p>More generally I was curious about whether something would qualify as a FHIR interop standard if it requires use of a proprietary tool.  I think this thread's answer is no.</p>

<p>it certainly would be absolute for a specification HL7 publishes.. right? Other organizations could write implementation guides that require things that are okay to require by that organization.  I would be very disturbed by HL7 endorsing a vendor solution. That seems wrong.</p>

We'd have to have a <em>really</em> good reason and it would need to be a situation where we weren't creating an advantage amongst competitors.  But that doesn't mean that weird situations don't sometimes come up...</p>

<p>Again, code sets are one thing ... requiring a specific document platform seems odd.  </p>
<p>It's hard for me (non-tech) to imagine why a specific platform would even need to be required, unless it uses a private protocol that no other system can use, which would seem very non-FHIRy.</p>

<p>My personal political view from the CARIN BB discussions is that license-encumbered code systems (especially in the payer space) are a significant hidden barrier to US patient access that will become a flash point in the future as small startups, open-source, or non-profit app developers start running into them. Patient advocates should push on this issue in the US regulatory process.</p>

<p>Related: to encourage consumer engagement in these discussions we need a summary table somewhere of which code systems are "license-encumbered" (as you put it) and which aren't, so that as more consumer voices join the space (because they CAN think about using their data, at last!), they can get up to speed. EG:</p>
<ul>
<li>ICD-10: disease classification codes (conditions a patient has).  Free / not-free?</li>
<li>CPT: procedure codes, i.e. things providers do (for your conditions) and submit bills for. Owned by the AMA; expensive license fees if you want to do ____ but not if you just want to _____.</li>
<li>SNOMED-CT: ____</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197072">@Paul Church</span> it would be helpful to hear a simple example from the CARIN BB discussions.  Anything that impedes consumer access will surely cause harm to someone, and it's just not fair to do that to someone for commercial benefit.</p>

<p>I agree that licensed code systems will limit startup app developers' ability to display data in a meaningful way. The easiest solution would be to include the descriptions along with the codes. That way, an application developer without a license can display the data in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Even if an FHIR standard does not require proprietary technology, these requirements can be implicit. We see this now with the PDex Payer-to-payer IG. The guide does not require the use of any proprietary/non-standard technologies. But for the desired interactions to occur, several new technologies need to be adopted.</p>

<p>note that terminologies licenses are not usually a problem for patients. This is especially true for patients receiving data created somewhere else.  As Josh stated the solution there is to always include the display name for a code along with the use of that code. The terminology licenses usually only apply to times when one is creating data, cases where the set of terminology needs to be within the system. This can happen to some degree in Patient-Generated-Health-Data situations, where the patient would need to choose from a set of terminologies.</p>
<p>So where data is coded with ICD-10 codes, the licensing is handled at the data creator side. A patient downloading this data is not affected by the licensing. As long as the data created included the display name for the codes used.</p>

<p>The (free-to-use) SNOMED CT Global Patient Set - which includes all the SNOMED CT concepts used in the International Patient Summary - does contain Fully Specified Names which are the definitive, unambiguous descriptions of a concept - along with the Concept Identifier and the Preferred Term from the US Language Reference Set. However, as Lloyd points out, it does not include the defining (or indeed any) relationship data. So, it's basically a simple, non-hierarchical Value Set.</p>

A presentation of the Advance Directive interop flow was presented to the Patient Empowerment workgroup yesterday. In the presentation, the patient's AD was stored in a proprietary system and a pointer to the data in that system was being shared with the patient and the EHR. The data itself was not being shared. (This question was asked and confirmed that it was a pointer to the data...the AD itself was not being sent to the patient or EHR. ) This brought up a question offline about the definition of "interoperability".  Is interoperability sharing data in a standard format so that all systems involved in the exchange have the data or does it include just sharing pointers to data in a proprietary system.  We need clarity on that. </p>

<p>In German it is called "Stille Post" - silent post. A translation service told me that. Maybe it is not correct.<br>
Anyhow, in Germany, perhaps everywhere interoperability is declared to reuse data. But how do you know that it is correct? Simply using it is not sufficient.<br>

<p>Returning to the thread title, the <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/himss-writes-new-definition-interoperability">HIMSS definition of interoperability</a> two years ago, I'd love to see a simple / consumer-friendly example described at the four levels in that definition. Help, someone?</p>
<p>For a start, let's say a local lab wants to send me my coronavirus PCR test results.  (Are there codes established for these tests?  If not, we may need a better example here.)</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foundational</strong> ... the inter-connectivity requirements...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This would just be the ability for the lab to send me ANYTHING, with neither system knowing what it is. "Hey messaging software: send this thing to Dave. No clue what it is - could be a JPEG for all I know. Just send it."</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structural</strong> ...  the meaning of the data is preserved and unaltered. ... interpreted at the data field level.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At this level, the sending system knows that SOME data field has been received, but still doesn't know what it is.  </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semantic</strong> ... the ability of two or more systems ... to exchange information ... so that the receiving systems can <strong>interpret</strong> the data. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At this level, the receiving system KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS.  ("Semantics" is about meaning.)  "it's a coronavirus PCR test result, and so does the receiving system - right?</p>
<p>This is often where it can get messy, because different systems as used by different hospitals may have slightly different meanings for the same term - right?   How might we express this in the PCR test example, or would a different example be better?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizational</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I confess that I have no clue what this means. Help?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span>, it sounds like you are proposing that the word "interoperable" is not currently interoperable. </p>
<p>To me, interoperability is a way to describe something that can be "operated upon in a meaningful, predictable way by two actors.". Nationwide or global health data interoperability would be an amazing achievement. From what I understand, interoperability within a single health system can be a huge victory too. This understanding should temper our expectations about the degree of interoperation between systems. </p>
<p>So as we look at interoperability, it will always be a moving target. We can always interoperate better.</p>
<p>Within an industry, terms like interoperability become loaded. A nice strong definition for the general public will be good. I do not think the public will hear about this as interoperability, though.</p>

<p>The purpose of having these levels of interoperability is not to say that the word "interoperability" is not understood. It is to give a maturity evaluation to the stepping-stones one needs to go thru to get it. The model that HIMSS is putting forward is specific to healthcare for treatment. The core internet networking has a similar model that is lovingly referred to as the OSI 7 layer model <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model</a><br>
One can have a network that is only addressing layers 1-4, but one gets more interoperability if they add layer 5, etc... so it is an effort in defining models.</p>

<p>I don't know what you meant, Debbie,  when you said, "A presentation of the Advance Directive interop flow was presented to the Patient Empowerment workgroup yesterday. In the presentation, the patient's AD was stored in a proprietary system and a pointer to the data in that system was being shared with the patient and the EHR. The data itself was not being shared. (This question was asked and confirmed that it was a pointer to the data...the AD itself was not being sent to the patient or EHR. )"  That is not an accurate description of what we are showing.  The AD information is stored in a system that offers a standard FHIR API. The AD information is released using standard FHIR and   C-CDA mechanisms.  Systems don't only receive  "a pointer to the data" , they query for the information and actually receive the standard document that holds the AD information.  This will be demonstrated at Connectathon in the PACIO Track. I recommend you check it out.  Standard, interoperable exchange of Advance Directive information.</p>

<p>I'm puzzled by this thread as well, as I understood Connectathons to be the process by which people who may have proprietary systems showcase how those systems demonstrate the standards being used/developed so that we highlight both what we have to improve about the interoperability rules and also showcase what is possible using the tools and systems that may already have been commercialized or are in the process of being commercialized. That being said, I think it's true that most of our rules about how APIs operate are using data that is fixed in time and being exchanged. ADs are different, in that the person's AD may change over time and you always want the most up-to-date version. In this case, it seems logical to me that the API would provide pointers to the storage point--the current source of truth--rather than the actual data. That doesn't stop a consumer from choosing to use system A vs system B as their storage point...</p>

<p>I think part of the issue is that if there is a login to system A (where my AD is stored) and i go into a hospital in another state that is not aware of system A and doesn't have a login to system A, how are they supposed to get my AD? But, if I am able to create an AD and have it in my consumer app and share it with EHR 1(my primary doc) in a structured way...and EHR 1 is able to absorb it and share it with EHR 2 (the hospital in another state) then they both have my AD. And if i have a copy of it in my consumer app, my care advocate that is linked to my app could have it on hand without trying to figure out what my password is for system A. </p>
<p>It sounds like Lisa is able to absorb the data and create a CCD which can be stored in a consumer app and shared with any provider, and that provider can share it with another provider (via CCD). </p>
<p>There has been a lot of discussion about the importance of a patient having a copy of their own data. If we built a system where a patient shared a pointer to a single system for providers to view the patient's most current medication list, there would be obvious concerns raised about that method. Having data stored somewhere and only sharing a pointer to it (and requiring a login) can cause severe road blocks that will impact patients who are in an emergency situation. I am happy to hear the plan is to share the actual data and not just a pointer to the data in a locked system that needs a password. Don't get me wrong. I think having systems that can store a patient's AD is good, i just don't think it makes sense to build interoperability standards that only share pointers. But, Lisa answered the question that was asked last week: "Are you sharing a pointer or are you sharing the data?" I believe i heard "We are sharing a pointer" last week, but it sounds like I misunderstood. Happy to see the data flow! That is so important to patients.</p>

<p>Debi, We can discuss this in a different context, but I believe that AD data is different in kind than the rest of the patient's medical record. The rest of the data is observations at a particular point in time that don't change. The lab I had taken on 1/6/21 has the same value no matter how many times it is passed around. But my AD might be quite different from time to time. I may have put in a DNR order last year when my health was in great jeopardy, but this year, when I am healthier, I want to recind my DNR order. Having a pointer to the CURRENT AD really matters and old copies floating around could result in a very different--and lethal--outcome. Other data it makes sense to trend and it's ok to have multiple copies because trending my lab results from 1/6/21 with similar lab results from the past provides useful trending information. Wishes are not the same.</p>

<p>In my mind, the biggest barriers in health tech today aren't slicing and dicing interoperability into layers but are functions of trust frameworks - intraorganization, between organization, and consumer mediated</p>
<p>HL7v2 and MLLP were fine for intraorganization exchange but were not well suited for interorg exchange. </p>
<p>Our foray into XML and mutual TLS has been okay as a tool for inter org exchange but wasn't great for patient mediated (via MU3 VDT and APIs).

<p>FHIR has proven a very nice fit for patient mediated interoperability, less because of its format or content but more due to its status as open documentation, SMART authentication.</p>
<p>Thinking about standards in light of those trust domains is a cognitive map that's more useful to me than "how well are we encoding and parsing data" which equates our problems to mapping exercises. That's certainly something all organizations need to tackle, but without appropriate interoperability trust frameworks, there's no exchange to begin with.</p>

<p>FHIR has proven a very nice fit for patient mediated interoperability, less because of its format or content but more due to its status as open documentation, SMART authentication.</p>
<p>**Thinking about standards in light of those trust domains is a cognitive map that's more useful to me than "how well are we encoding and parsing data" which equates our problems to mapping exercises. <br>
**<br>
That's certainly something all organizations need to tackle, but without appropriate interoperability trust frameworks, there's no exchange to begin with.</p>

<p>Thanks Dave. </p>
<p>A timely example of an "interoperability" problem - lab and vaccine reporting. Labs struggled to report to public health agencies. Now we're seeing similar with vaccination administration. Cue the "healthcare has interoperability problems" chorus. But it's not a semantic interoperability problem - CDC did great work to prescriptively guide states to use HL7v2.5.1 ORU/VXU/QBP/RSP. So if it's not semantic interoperability, what is it?</p>
<p>It's a function of failed trust. Labs can't/don't report because it's too hard to "onboard" onto each state's inter org trust policies. The greatest promise of FHIR here (and in general) isn't the semantic interoperability; it's the modern authentication patterns such as SMART or UDAP. The "better encoding" and easier readability of FHIR is just a bonus! By applying modern authentication, we get modern, scalable trust patterns in intra-org, inter-org, and patient authenticated interoperability.</p>
<p>For public health, a broad trust agreement with a centralized registry, akin to Carequality, would be a massive level up over today's "connect point to point with 64 different trust policies/processes"</p>

<p>I'm confused by this. Having open documentation that is easily accessible reduces friction and allows developers to do their job. Building overly academic, unimplementable standards as ivory towers with pay walls benefits very few. Plenty of examples in the wasteland of failed standards to point to in this regard.</p>

<p>The need to use tools to read instances creates friction when authoring, debugging and understanding.  Realistically, in a formal computable exchange syntax, there's always a trade-off.  But something like FHIR is certainly much easier for developers to work with (and is harder to mess up) than something like v2 - or even v3.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="200498">@Brendan Keeler</span> - can you expand on a few things here? When you say labs "onboard" onto each state's inter org trust policies, what exactly are you referring to?  You mention authentication patterns like SMART and UDAP hold the most promise, but then say there is a need for a broad trust agreement and centralized registry.  In your opinion, are the authentication patterns complementary to a centralized registry (enabler or other).  It would seem that the centralized registry would be a workaround to a lack of implementation of modern authentication patterns, but interested in your perspective here. (Caveat - I'm a non-technical person interested in solutions for lab result reporting)</p>

<p>I would note that even under the patient right of access, individuals still often want to limit the permissions that they share with certain apps. So there is a layering of permissions here; if I have access to certain data, then I can decide to share a subset of those data downstream. This is still a challenging problem in its own right... though of course it goes away in the sub case where you walk to share everything you are allowed to access.</p>

<p>Josh, when the patient is the user, and they are introducing a new app to their FHIR api data... they will be able to refine the data that the app will get using the SMART scopes. Today the choices are rather un-inspiring.. but there is work on a more granular scope system. Which brings up the point that it is good to NOW bring up the kinds of things that a patient might want to limit an app to... Think an app that represents a clinical-research-project, I am willing to give it X kind of data, but not Y kind of data. Likely keeping it from my mental-health data.</p>

<p>In other words, data is shared when an application shares the data, not when an application pulls data for a patient.</p>
<p>This is also connected to the business-to-business patient facilitated application infographic I shared. A business-to-business application is trusted because of the protections offered by HIPAA.</p>
<p>If you use this mindset (and B2B applications when a  business is receiving sensitive data), patient/*.read is not that bad. We want granular controls on create,update,delete.</p>
