<p>Whilst I applaud the internationalization principle ("Global Relevance: 2020 has demonstrated the imperative for global health data interoperability. HL7 FHIR adoption is critical to achieving that goal. Driving further adoption requires that we embrace our global community and move beyond our traditional stakeholders and approaches.") - the task force itself, and some of the stakeholder groups mentioned (<a href="http://HL7.org">HL7.org</a> membership and groups such as the HL7 Advisory Board, TSC, IC, Co-Chairs) have a large <del>US-bias</del> overrepresentation of US stakeholders. <br>
If one 'follows the money', then the US market is low hanging fruit. Embracing a philosphy to enable fruit to grow anywhere around the world will require some major changes to HL7 international and its affiliates.  <br>
Seems like a good topic for the #social stream.. lots of opinions, I'm sure.</p>

<p>Totally agree with your comments <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191372">@René Spronk</span>  and, without speaking out of turn (I hope), these have also been made by the non-US members of the Board. I'd certainly like to see International Council and Affiliate Members in general play a major role in implementing the 'Global Relevance' theme. While I realise that this is re-litigating issues fully debated in the past, there have been some major changes since the last major IC proposal for re-structuring the organisation was rejected; namely - free IP, FHIR and COVID-19.</p>

<p>I fully realize that the affiliates will also have to compromise and let go of some of their entrenched positions. If not we're forcing HL7 'international'  to again be mostly focused on the US. But it would certainly be helpful if e.g. 50% of this taskforce were not to be based in the US, given that (if  we look at HL7 membership numbers accross all HL7 organizations) more than 50% of the membership isn't actually based in the US.  </p>
<p>Just for fun: remember this spoof <a href="http://www.ihmsdo.org/">http://www.ihmsdo.org/</a> from years ago?</p>
