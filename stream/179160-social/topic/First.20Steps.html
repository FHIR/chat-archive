<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I have been working with IoT for some time, but in the world of Machine Tools. So I am very familiar with industry standards like MTConnect.</p>
<p>I accepted the challenge of moving to health care, which is completely new to me. Could someone please point the best way to start with health care connectivity standards?</p>
<p>I want to follow the right path from the beginning. </p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance!</p>

<p>HL7 provides training on the standards such as HL7v2, CDA and FHIR.  IT's a good step to go with training.  FHIR is the latest and greatest (and available at <a href="http://fhir.hl7.org">fhir.hl7.org</a> if you like a self driven learning)</p>
