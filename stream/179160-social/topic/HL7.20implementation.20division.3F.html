<p>Consistent with my befuddlement about how HL7 works, after two years: </p>
<p>I've been hearing about the new HL7 implementation division, but googling produces not a single hit.  What can I read about it?'</p>
<p>Searching all spaces in Confluence produces numerous <em>mentions</em> in various WG minutes but several minutes of scrolling didn't find an announcement.  It appears to have been announced at the September WGM but I haven't found anything outside that session, except a note in one WG that hirings will be announced next Monday, December 6.</p>
<p>What am I missing?  I'd love to understand its purpose, charter, etc.</p>

<p>you haven't missed a thing. Every one wants to know that. But you should have got the email about it</p>

<p>Dear HL7 members,</p>
<p>At the recent Working Group Meeting (WGM), HL7 leadership made two exciting announcements relative to our Re-envisioning efforts:<br>
Formation of an Implementation Division approved by HL7 Board<br>
Awarding of the Re-envisioning change management contract<br>
New Implementation Division<br>
In July, the HL7 Board of Directors approved the recommendation from the Re-envisioning New Internal Structure task group (NISTG) to form a new Implementation Division (ID) within HL7 based on the following.<br>
HL7 vision: adoption and implementation of HL7 standards are both critical to its achievement<br>
Current organizational structure: supports standards development but is not well suited to support the needs of standards implementers<br>
Viet Nguyen and Diego Kaminker were leads in developing preliminary ID plans over recent months and facilitated a birds-of-a-feather session during the WGM.</p>
<p>In addition to having its own governance structure including a Chief Implementation Officer and an Implementation Technical Committee, the ID will be responsible for core processes including:<br>
Implementer support<br>
Ecosystem development &amp; management<br>
Education services<br>
Marketing &amp; outreach<br>
More details can be found in the <a href="https://hl7.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2b25415351d5c5f116ed63d05&amp;id=1d9d7ddfeb&amp;e=25a434c23e">birds-of-a feather recording</a> and an email will be sent with additional opportunities to provide input.</p>
