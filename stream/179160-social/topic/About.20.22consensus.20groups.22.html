<p>We new-to-HL7 co-chairs were greeted today with an email full of mystery.  Help, please, with one item:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Health Level Seven International® invites you to take part in the formation of <strong>consensus groups</strong>....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later in the email I see "Comments received from consensus group members will be addressed at that WGM or in regular teleconferences."</p>
<p>Is there somewhere a human readable description of consensus groups and their role in the HL7 process?</p>

<p>I suspect that's marketing speak.  'Consensus' has become something of a buzz word in the past 4 years, what with blockchain and the amount of civil unrest going on worldwide and within the US.  The balloting process has traditionally been the measure of consensus, both in HL7 and other ANSI standards development organizations.  But until recently, people didn't necessarily discuss it in those terms.  There might be somebody else who chimes in with a more authoritative answer.  Until then, my guess is it's a marketing position to appeal to the blockchain crowd and others who are concerned about epistemological issues involving truthiness, sources of truth, and trust networks.</p>

<p>Those who wish to vote on a ballot of a particular standard declare their intent by joining the consensus group. The pass/fail rate of the specification is based on the list of participants who signed up to vote for that specification. </p>

<p>From what I understand, this stems from ANSI requirements, including the timing - the consensus group must be created before the ballot is published for voting.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with blockchain.... Standards organizations have been doing "Consensus" for hundreds of years, well before blockchain</p>

<p>As Vassil points out, individuals must sign up to vote (register to vote) prior to a given deadline. That signup deadline is important to determine enough interest and determine who is interested. That deadline is significantly prior to the deadline to vote.  Individuals can't just show up on voting day and vote.</p>

<p>Those words come from ANSI.  You can read the ANSI Essential Requirements which list the requirements for procedures around the American National Standards process.  Section 2.7 is about consensus.  <a href="http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/ANSI_Essential_Requirements.pdf">http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/ANSI_Essential_Requirements.pdf</a></p>
<p>You can also look at HL7's Essential Requirements which dictate how HL7 is implementing those ANSI requirements.  For Normative Balloting, section 02 is important (02.04 is about the formation of the consensus group).   <a href="http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/ANSI_Essential_Requirements.pdf">http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/ANSI_Essential_Requirements.pdf</a></p>
<p>For those of us who are co-chairs, we are expected to know about this as described in the Co-Chairs' Handbook in Chapter 5 on Balloting: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CH#CoChairHandbook-Chapter5-Balloting">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CH#CoChairHandbook-Chapter5-Balloting</a></p>

<p>I stand corrected.  ;)</p>
<p>Although, I will also stand by the claim that, as a matter of routine day-to-day activity, a lot of the messaging new members receive tends to be more around balloting.  At least that was my experience.   I'm in agreement that consensus has been around for hundreds of years, but we don't always talk about it using that specific term.  There's quite a few synonyms in use.  (And it just happens that blockchain has brought 'consensus' back into fashion, even though it's been kicking around in the ANSI documentation for years.)</p>

<p>I don’t object to jargon. Re new members, the problem isn’t jargon (at least not for me), it’s the insanely evolving bureaucracy and infrastructure. I will pull back from trying to keep up with it. If that means I get FHIR-fired, so be it. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span>.

<p>don't pull back - it's good to be reminded when we have jargon. If it's necessary, we can at least clarify somewhere</p>

<p>I didn't mean pulling back from the jargon - I meant from the evolving bureaucracy and infrastructure. "Oops, you used the wrong PSS model, because we haven't announced the new one, except it needs to be a proposal before it can be a PSS, but they're both listed on the PSS page." "And OBTW xyz is moving from Confluence to Jira," etc.  </p>
<p>I'm sure I have the particulars wrong in those, but they're based on recent dazzling real items; my point is that it all makes a newbie's head spin, and THAT is what I'm pulling back from, for the sake of my sanity and my happiness about being involved.  I'll either catch up with process &amp; platform when they're reasonably stabilised someday, and/or let others roll with that aspect of being a change agent, while I focus on the thinking &amp; evangelizing.</p>
<p>One thing's sure - if we want to engage the public to any extent, we need a large buffer zone or ambassador corps (a consulate?) to shield them from it while we engage with their thoughts, wants, and needs.</p>

<p>lol. That'll be the day. </p>
<p>I suppose I shouldn't laugh, really, since I'm responsible for the ongoing change. It's always a tension between just leaving things as they are and making things better / easier for some reason. What change is justified?</p>

<p>And I don't want to impede that.  I'm just saying that if I, with standards experience elsewhere and at least some bit of experience with product management and software development ... If someone with <em>that</em> background gags and falls over dizzy from the head-spinning, then we really do need a buffer zone between this and the general public. </p>
<p>And this is important, because it's too easy to diss the clueless public, saying "They wouldn't understand what we do," when we exist solely because of their needs.  (I know you know this deeply but I wouldn't assume all readers do.)</p>
