<p>Zulip is a collection of...<br>
Streams<br>
Channels?</p>

<p>Zulip's word is 'stream', so probably best to use that</p>

<p>But they're not streams!  They're channels!  I have 40 years of being old and using channels.</p>

<p>I thought that stream was the grouping -- #social . But inside a stream are threads/channels/drips</p>

<p>Yeh, Slack calls their equivalent to Zulip stream, Channels, which makes more sense to me.   Like radio and TV stations (in the old analog world) Channels were what you 'tuned into'.    To me the concept of 'Streams' has the connotation of real-time, optimized video or audio data for viewing/listening; i.e. it's delivered incrementally.</p>

<p>One might say that messages show up on a stream here in a real-time fashion, delivered incrementally :-)</p>
<p>If you don't love the "stream" and "topic" terminology, you might appreciate the following factoid: Zulip was originally modeled after MIT's internal chat system called Zephyr. In Zephyr, the word for channels/streams was "Classes" and the word for topics was "Instances". So perhaps you might at least agree that we've made progress in clarity of terms...</p>
