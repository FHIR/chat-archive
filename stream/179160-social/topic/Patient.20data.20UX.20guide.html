<p>The CARIN Alliance released a resource today that our team at Arcweb has been collaborating with them on for several months, a UX guide for consumer app developers to help users make informed decisions about their healthcare data. It's based on he CARIN code of conduct and includes info about UX best practices, tone &amp; style, and a sample app with the recommendations in action. It also ties into their app registration &amp; attestation process, and is currently being expanded with additional info for payers.</p>
