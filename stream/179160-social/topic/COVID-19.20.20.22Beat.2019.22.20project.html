<p>The Genetic Alliance, Cancer Commons, xCures and Luna DNA are in the process of announcing (today) a "Beat 19" project at <a href="http://Beat19.org" title="http://Beat19.org">Beat19.org</a>. They're seeking 100,000 participants:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beat19 is an IRB approved research study that has been set up to collect symptoms and outcomes from 100,000 people over the next few weeks and generate data to help beat the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked Genetic Alliance CEO Sharon Terry if they're importing data from elsewhere. She said "We don't have mHealth integration yet." Knowing her, I expect it'll be on the roadmap and they're busting this out now for manual data submission.</p>
<p>Here's the text of my copy of the invitation email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am writing you today to ask you to join the #Beat19 movement, an IRB-approved citizen science initiative to track how the coronavirus evolves (before, during and after symptoms start), and how pre-existing conditions, medications, and other factors affect disease progression.</p>
<p>Participants provide confidential data, using a short daily survey sent via email. As we accumulate data and bring on partners, we'll begin opening up the de-identified data set to the medical community. Understanding patterns in it has the potential to save countless lives.</p>
<p>Now is the time to act. Please sign up at <a href="https://beat19.org/" title="https://beat19.org/">https://beat19.org/</a></p>
<p>We aim to sign up at least 100,000 people in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Let’s #Beat19 together!</p>
</blockquote>
