<p>Is anyone in HL7 tasked with examining and defining the future state of care?</p>
<p>I ask this because I keep encountering real-world problems that are emerging as data starts moving around, and these are surely limited-duration problems which IMO should be <em>coped with</em> but should not be design goals.</p>

<p>we do that informally but I don't know how we could have a collective opinion</p>

<p>Is this the place on Zulip to demonstrate the need for this as a more formal project?</p>

<p>I guess - see what other people think</p>

<p>Future state of care for what?  where?  HL7's scope includes chickens on a farm, rats in a research library, ebola treatment in the Congo, social services in Kyoto and cardiac research in Boston.  In the end, we can't move faster than the community of implementers who are wanting to build things "now".  Doing some forecasting to identify issues we might need to address in our specs could theoretically be useful, but as a standards development organization, all we can really do is facilitate behaviors that implementers are interested in and scope those to be designed to evolve in ways we think might be helpful.</p>
