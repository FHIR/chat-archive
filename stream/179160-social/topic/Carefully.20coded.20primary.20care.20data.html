<p>Thought this might amuse some:<br>
<a href="https://www.emishealth.com/news-events/news/1-700-gp-practices-contribute-patient-data-for-oxford-covid-19-research/">https://www.emishealth.com/news-events/news/1-700-gp-practices-contribute-patient-data-for-oxford-covid-19-research/</a></p>
<p>Been churning data since ...ummm earlier in the year to try &amp; determine covid risk factors (on with other non-covid ehr based risk factor scoring now we're so practised at it :-) ). </p>
<p>With mostly my former snomed hat on (but thought it would appeal to some here) the quote which stood out was: </p>
<p>“The sheer numbers coming forward have surprised and delighted me, but primary care has really stepped up to the plate on all fronts in this crisis. It would be difficult to do this research without carefully coded primary care data. For example, ethnicity is well recorded by many GP practices, and this was vital to help us understand the impact of COVID-19 on BAME communities.”</p>
<p>&amp; especially: </p>
<p>"It would be difficult to do this research without carefully coded primary care data"</p>
<p>Other examples of things that can then be looked at:<br>
"The data is enabling the researchers to understand the spread of COVID-19, including tracking when it peaks and helping to inform strategy on local social distancing and lockdown. It is also being used to evaluate rapid COVID-19 finger prick tests against swab tests. Some practices are taking part in rapid clinical trials of antibiotics to reduce the duration and severity of the virus."</p>
