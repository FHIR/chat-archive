<p>If any of you have kids or grand-kids who would enjoy playing cards with someone they're social distancing from, here's a cool (and free and as far as I can tell, ad-free) website that lets you play cards with someone remotely.  It's super simple.  Has some built-in games like Go Fish, Checkers &amp; Crazy Eights, but you can also play an arbitrary game that makes use of card decks.  (No chips though unless you use checkers...)  <a href="http://playingcards.io/" title="http://playingcards.io/">http://playingcards.io/</a></p>
