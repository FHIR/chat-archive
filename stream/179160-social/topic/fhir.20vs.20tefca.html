<p>Hey all, I'm new here and trying to get my arms around interoperability. My company does EHR privacy auditing and has support for major EHR vendors through database exports from their data warehouse, and now I'm trying to understand how to integrate with the long-tail of other systems that are used within health systems. The hope is that FHIR is at least a partial solution using AuditEvent and bulk export. I also recently stumbled across TEFCA which seems to be an attempt at the federal level to have interoperability with the hospitals similar to what is done at the state HIE level. Do you all know if building to FHIR will account for most of what is desired in TEFCA, or are they two separate entities doing divergent things?</p>

<p>and perhaps more importantly for me, what do I have to learn and build to have  interoperability with most secondary systems to the EHR. I'm guessing FHIR is the eventual answer, but not sure about the short term</p>

<p>FHIR is a core international standard intended to cover a very wide range of use-cases globally. TEFCA is a USA/HHS/ONC policy statement.  If USA is your market, then look to the US-Core Implementation Guide just published with FHIR R4. (Or the previous Argonaut published to support DSTU2)</p>
