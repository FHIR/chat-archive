<p>not sure this is social, but does anyone have any info on mapping FHIR onto the FAIR Guiding Principles i.e. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618" target="_blank" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618</a> (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data</a>). It includes lots that FHIR does/has e.g. open, free, metadata to be accessible etc. But to tick all the FAIR boxes would take a little bit of explanation. Wondering if that exercise has been done.</p>

<p>it's a bit orthogonal to what we're really doing - patient data is not (generally) openly published for research. But its something that could be done, so maybe it would be interesting to see if you could do it. but you're right - doesn't look like a small thing</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191651">@Rik Smithies</span>  I haven't done any mapping, but HL7 Netherlands has good contact with the GoFair consortium. Actually, on the HL7 Netherlands WGM last year, we had a small hackathon about using a FHIR server as data station in a Personal Health Train research algorithm that was sent to multiple FAIR data stations. The source code for using a FHIR server as data station is at <a href="https://github.com/jvsoest/PHT_on_FHIR_demo" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/jvsoest/PHT_on_FHIR_demo">https://github.com/jvsoest/PHT_on_FHIR_demo</a></p>
