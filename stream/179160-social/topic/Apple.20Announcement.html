<p>It is only available if you set the region of your iOS device to "United States". Even then it is only possible to read resources from a list of pre-selected providers. All of these are implementing Argonaut. The API itself seems to be build around Argonaut, too. If you look at HKFHIRResourceType in the documentation above, you'll see that only the resource types which are being used in Argonaut are currently supported.</p>

<p>Apple is simply exposing the FHIR data they are getting from the providers, so to switch to STU3 (or R4) first all the EHR vendors have to support STU3 and then all the providers have to upgrade to STU3</p>

<p>Does anyone know where I can get technical info on the <strong><em>provider-side</em></strong> of Apple's recently announced FHIR-based clinical records capability?</p>
<p>Apple claims to have an ecosystem of some 500+ healthcare providers that have the ability to upload FHIR-based clinical health records,  but the focus of what I've discovered from Apple so far focuses on the <em>consumer-side</em> -- i.e., how IoS apps can use new HealthKit enhancements to gain access to and use FHIR-based clinical health records that have <strong><em>already been uploaded</em></strong> to their IoS device.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191355">@Kevin Shekleton</span>. Hmm... so far that page turned out to be a dead-end. There's no technical content on that page, but I dutifully followed their suggestion to "get started" by registering my business. That just led me to the generic Apple Business Registry from which I could find zero info on provider-side FHIR-upload service.</p>
<p>So, alas, I'm back at square one in my quest to find the tech info I'm looking for. It's curious that Apple seems determined to keep this such a deep secret. I would have thought they would want adoption on the provider-side.</p>

<p>I have a suspicion that 500 number is the current market cap/opportunity, not the actual implementation.  There’s ~150 FHIR servers currently available via Open Epic, and an equal number from Cerner.  Anybody who implements a SMART on FHIR app that conforms to the Argonaut spec and passes QA for both an Epic instance and a Cerner instance can then claim to have access opportunity into 300 hospitals.  Because interoperability.  Add in AllScripts and McKesson; or maybe Redox, etc and I bet one can get to 500.  About 10% of the US hospital market, which is no small feat.  But that might only be a few dozen hospitals in practice.  I don’t think it’s a deep secret so much as interoperability allows companies to make certain types of market opportunity claims that are easy to misinterpret as existing client base.</p>

<p>Thanks for providing some context around market claims, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191678">@Abigail Watson</span>. I realize I should have been clearer with my goal here. I wasn't really questioning Apple's figure of 500, I'm trying to figure out how to become the "501st".  In other words, I am looking for technical documentation on the process and requirements for becoming a provider of such HealthRecords (e.g., what is required in order to publish our lab results and analysis in a way that allows our patients to pull them onto their IoS device).</p>
<p>I assume it involves standing up some sort of FHIR server. From your reply, I infer that perhaps that server need merely comply with the Argonaut IG. Is that really all there is to it?</p>
<p>Thanks for providing the Apple email address, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191339">@Pascal Pfiffner</span> ! I've sent them my inquiry. Looking forward to their response.</p>

<p>Yes, my understanding is that’s basically all thats involved. Stand up a server that maps your lab results to the FHIR protocol.  Epic and Cerner will be happy to sell you products that will do it.  There are HAPI and Meteor on FHIR servers if you want to build it yourself.  Argonaut is a great place to start, but Aegis Touchstone conformance may be better (and to a lesser degree Project Crucible conformance).</p>
