<p>We recently held a talk about patient data and the Cures Act aimed at educating consumer app developers about some of the regulatory impact on the healthcare industry and beyond. We included other members of the CARIN Alliance and tried to create a more general audience resource that didn't require deep familiarity with interoperability or health IT, and wanted to share since we feel it's important to start bringing the general industry up to speed who may not have been aware of the changes.</p>

We would love more examples to share with people who are getting up to speed.</p>
