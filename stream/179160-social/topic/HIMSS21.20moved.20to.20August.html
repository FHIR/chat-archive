<p>For any who didn't see it - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we all continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, the health and safety of the global HIMSS community, employees and local residents remain our top priority. That’s why we’re moving HIMSS21 to August 9–13, 2021 in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>HIMSS20 paid registrations will be transferred to HIMSS21, and all registrants will receive further details and instructions regarding the registration process later this summer. See our Registration FAQs for more information.</p>
<p>Registration and hotel reservations will open in fall 2020. The Call for Reviewers will open September 14, and the Call for Proposals will open October 5.</p>
<p>Please stay tuned—more details will be coming soon.</p>
<p>Note: HIMSS22 is currently scheduled for March 2022, according to the usual HIMSS Global Health Conference schedule.</p>
