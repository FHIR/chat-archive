<p>Wow. I'm posting this here after taking my nitroglycerine pill, so the next victim might find it in a search. </p>
<p>After a richly productive Patient Empowermnt WG meeting today, with live minutes-taking throughout, Chrome crashed when I was almost ready to publish. To my surprise, the "recently worked on" link only gives me my raw/naked unedited document, which is not what's happened to me in the past, I think. I first drafted this to say: "Am I screwed or is there any chance of getting it back?"</p>
<p>Then realized - this thing may be Cloud-y, but it does NOT think like a Google Doc.  I clicked the Edit link at top of screen, and voila, my unfinished / unpublished draft was there, ready for me to continue. </p>
<p>I submit to the Confluence gods that it would be awfully awfully nice to have SOME indication somewhere of "You have unpublished edits."  (Or, if that does exist, I'm blind.)</p>

<p>Look for this at the top of the page:<br>

<p>Yessir, I saw that:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/10155/WAZ6fk3mzhNpgzRlOpOdrgJB/image.png" title="image.png">image.png</a> <br>
HOWEVER when I clicked one open, my unpublished changes were not evident - all I saw was the previous (published) edition!</p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/10155/WAZ6fk3mzhNpgzRlOpOdrgJB/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/10155/WAZ6fk3mzhNpgzRlOpOdrgJB/image.png"></a></div><p>Only when I clicked Edit were my unpublished changes visible so I could resume.  (To me it appeared that it had gotten saved with only  some token initial keystroke recorded)</p>
<p>The Confluence paradigm that's slowly sinking in is that it's a repository of <em>published</em> documents, and I need to take action to resume editing - if I merely click where it says "unpublished changes" I don't get to see them. I don't think I've ever seen a system like it - but I'm learning.  (Ultimately I figured this one out all by myself!)</p>
