<p>As you begin using JIRA to manage specification feedback for CDA IGs, we wanted to provide some helpful tips on how to set up a dashboard to organize and track comments. </p>
<p>Jira supports creating a dashboard that is very helpful for viewing and managing comments. You can see an example of a CDA IG dashboard by reviewing the one that has been created for the CCDA IG<a href="user_uploads/10155/2Ty9-izfKWOtpiwAE3zS2Ylf/Dashboard1.jspa">Dashboard1.jspa</a> .</p>
<p>The process for creating a new dashboard from an existing dashboard is a three step process that involves copying the dashboard, copying and updating the filters used in the gadgets, and updating the dashboard copy to use the updated filters. This google presentation shows <a href="user_uploads/10155/vq6m2zoB6H-qMf7KE4kRD4sw/How-to-copy-and-update-a-dashboard-in-Jira1.pptx">How-to-copy-and-update-a-dashboard-in-Jira1.pptx</a>   Sponsoring Work Groups of CDA IG specifications are encouraged to use a dashboard as a means of providing the community with a common/consistent way of managing specification comments.</p>
