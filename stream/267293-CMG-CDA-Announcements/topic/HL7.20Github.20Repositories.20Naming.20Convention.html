<p>HL7 Github Repositories for CDA products now follow a standard naming convention</p>
<p><strong>As of December 20, 2021, Github Repositories for CDA products now begin with the three letters, CDA</strong></p>
<p>CDA Management Group is pleased to announce the new naming convention was applied to replace the wide range of previously used repository names which made it challenging to locate repositories holding CDA implementation guides and artifacts. "This has been done as an effort to make CDA implementation guides (IGs) easier to find which in turn accelerates their adoption", explained CMG co-chair Lisa Nelson. Improvements like these are part of a larger initiative to make CDA IGs more accessible and easier for implementers to determine their stability status and maturity level.</p>
