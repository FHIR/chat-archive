<p>Registration is open! <a href="https://www.hl7.org/events/c-cda/implementation/2021/10/">https://www.hl7.org/events/c-cda/implementation/2021/10/</a></p>
<p>On October 27-28 2021, the CDA community will be addressing issues that cause challenges for implementers today and preparing new guidance developed for USCDI v2.  </p>
<p>This virtual event promises to be packed with useful information you need to manage your product roadmap for C-CDA support. We will cover some of today’s most urgent implementer needs and provide updates on changes resulting from prior Implementation-A-Thons. </p>
<p>Topics are presented by C-CDA implementers such as: Allscripts, Cerner, Epic, MIE and the Commonwell/Carequality communities. You’ll be directly involved in creating implementer guidance that will be introduced in a new version of the C-CDA Companion Guide and a new version of the Concise Consolidated CDA IG for deploying Encounter Summary and Patient Summary Documents. Subject matter experts from the Gravity Project will be collaborating with participants to establish C-CDA templates for representing SDOH information in clinical documents using new coding guidance developed in this FHIR Accelerator.  </p>
<p>Representatives from the ONC will be there to talk with you about the use and testing of C-CDA document exchange to drive interoperability, and to provide insight into what comes next for the ever-evolving USCDI process. You’ll have a chance to contribute requirements for a new Value Set comparison tool that may be created to help implementers evaluate annual changes in C-CDA value sets.</p>
<p>We invite you and the implementers in your community to be a part of shaping the future of C-CDA.</p>
