<p><strong>New C-CDA Navigation Tool Offers Easier Access to C-CDA R2.1 Specification and Companion Guide</strong></p>
<p>On January 25, 2021, CMG announced publication of a new tool for navigating the C-CDA R2.1 specification and companion guide on the web. "We think the CDA Community is going to be very pleased," CMG Co-Chair Linda Michaelsen said.</p>
<p>The new website for navigating C-CDA and its Companion Guide resulted from a creative group within the CDA Community brainstorming ideas for how to make C-CDA more usable and easier to access. "We appreciate the efforts of those to pitched in to move this work from a possibility to published pages in just a couple weeks," added CMG Co-Chair Lisa Nelson, "and we especially thank John D'Amore from Diameter Health who took a leadership role in making this happen." </p>
<p>Check out the new C-CDA Navigation Tool. You have to see it to believe it.  <a href="http://hl7.me/viewccda">hl7.me/viewccda</a>.</p>
