<p>The IBM FHIR Server team is making plans for our next release of the open source project. There are some big changes we’d like to make, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>support for the forthcoming FHIR 4.3.0 (R4B) release</li>
<li>dropping support for Java 8</li>
<li>dropping the experimental “export to parquet” feature</li>
<li>changing the default behavior of whole-system history (already in main)</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of these changes, we’re thinking to bump the major version on all modules, so this release would be tagged as <code>5.0.0</code>.<br>
To avoid confusion with the next major release of the FHIR Specification (R5), we’re thinking to break the tie between our “marketing version” and our module versions, so the next release would be called “IBM FHIR Server 2022-1” instead of “IBM FHIR Server 5.0.0" at <a href="https://github.com/IBM/FHIR/releases">https://github.com/IBM/FHIR/releases</a> and in any announcement / communications.</p>
<p>If anyone has questions/concerns with this plan, please raise here or otherwise get in touch with us.</p>

<p>FHIR R4B is still not published.  Therefore, the IBM FHIR Server team has decided to revise our previously-communicated plan and release what we have in our main branch as version 4.11.0.<br>
Of the 4 bullets above, this release will include everything except the FHIR 4.3.0 support.  Please let us know if you have any concerns as we plan to tag the release soon.</p>
