<p>Hey, we are currently running our FHIR Server with version 4.7.1<br>
Now we are running in some problems with certain FHIR search requests which are blocked by the MaxIncludePageCount of 1000.<br>
I saw that there is the option to increase this using the config file, but that parameter was implemented in version 4.8.1<br>
Is there a possibility to increase this parameter in an older version as well?</p>

<p>hi Dorian, we don't typically patch older versions like that.  is there something preventing you from upgrading?</p>

<p>Hey, I'm not asking for a patch, only if there is a different way to set this variable.<br>
If that's not the case, we will update in the future</p>

<p>ya, i think it was hardcoded prior to that setting.  it used the fixed MAX_PAGE_SIZE constant for both the max "match" resource count and the max "include" resource count (so up to 2000 total)</p>
