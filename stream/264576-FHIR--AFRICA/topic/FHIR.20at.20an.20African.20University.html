<p>I just chatted with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194480">@Mark Braunstein</span> (Founder of the FHIR MOOC at Georgia Tech - now the world's largest FHIR educational course) about the possibility of getting FHIR taught at a prestigious African university. (Universities of course being one of activities that builds trust and credibility). In Mark's words..."In my experience having domain experts work with students in my Georgia Tech course created interest and recognition of what FHIR can do. I created a course similar to the one at Georgia Tech at the University of Queensland and was able to obtain permission for them to use my MOOC lectures in it. CSIRO is providing the FHIR platform. The issue would be having a platform for student projects in Africa but there must be a way to do that."</p>

<p>Mark just checked and Georgia Tech doesn't have a Computer Science partnership with any African University. Maybe this is a chance to make one. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> do you have any suggestions for any of the prestigious universities in Africa that might be interested? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="308467">@olivierkarasira</span> please do invite the other folk in Africa that were on the Zoom call we had with Grahame last night onto this thread. Let's see if there is interest.</p>

<p>I have an informatician contact in South Africa - let me check with him - Rhodes University - not sure if this fits the bill ?</p>
