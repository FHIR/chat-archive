<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191447">@Mark Kramer</span> can you provide a list of all the fields in US Core that have a minimum cardinality or must-support that creates problems for your work please?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  The only US Core profiles we use in mCODE are US Core Condition, US Core Observation Lab, US Core Diagnostic Report, US Core Patient, and US Core Procedure.  On US Core Patient, mCODE doesn't care about these MS elements: communication.language, address.line, .city, .state, .period, contact, race.text.  On US Core Diagnostic Report, we don't want to require the user to implement US Core Organization (referenced in DiagnosticReport.performer). The other MS flags are pretty minimal and don't create additional burden on the mCODE user.</p>

<p>specifically, why do you not require US Patient? I understand that mCode mightn't have it's own requirements for those things, but if those are general regulation based requirements, why not have them anyway? is mCode international?</p>

<p>mCODE is US realm, and we do require US Core Patient. However, mCODE for its own purposes doesn't need communication, address, etc (as above). If mCODE had the ability to independently assign its own MS flags, these would not be MS.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about that. If US-Core labels something as must-support, and you use it, what would it mean not to make it must-support?</p>
<ul>
<li>it seems to me that this implies that US-Core has a divergent use case?</li>

<p>For example, mCODE doesn't need the details  of the patient address, aside from the postal code, because of our use case is learning health care system. We aren't trying to contact the patient. US Core seems to assume that the patient is being treated in a health care system. The address information will probably be available, it is not harmful, but I'm only saying we don't need it.</p>

<p>So the cost of inheriting the mustSupport on the other components is that a system that's <em>only</em> being created for the purpose of mCode is being asked to do things that are unnecessary.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I think you often pay a price up front for supporting a standard.</p>
<p>I'd really like to know if we are making a correct assumption ... are implementers balking because of US Core?  Sounds like the burden falls on the mCode Sender or Responder.  The Receiver can just ignore whatever it does  not care about.   One view is these things are unnecessary and a burden but another implementer might already be set up for US Core so benefits from reuse.</p>

<p>We are facing similar issues with the Patient, Practitioner and other admin resources while developing the Canadian Core FHIR profiles. We consider defining 2 Canadian profiles for each of these resource: a relaxed one (with minimal constraints) for systems were these resources are used as supporting information (e.g. prescriber and dispenser in a pharmacy systems) and a constrained one for systems that are used as a source of truth for this information (e.g. Patient or Provider Registry).  For example, for a general Practitioner profile, we would define only name and identifier as Must Support where one instance of the identifier has to be an equivalent of NPI, but for the source of truth system (e.g. Provider registry), we would define a bunch of additional Must Support elements as well as required search parameters.</p>

<p>Another thing that's in play here is timing. It is not clear when US systems must certify as US Core compliant (2 years? 3 years?). But systems are implementing mCODE now. Using US Core as a base for mCODE is good citizenship, but also a bit forward-looking for vendors only looking to implement mCODE right NOW.</p>
