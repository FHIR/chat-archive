<p>As a European FHIR trainer, without having the wish to actually read the ONC final rule (who does, really?), the list of IGs associated with it seems pretty clear (there are many secondary sources for this). <br>
However, it's less clear to me what the status of the Argonaut Clinical Notes IG would be, or the Argonaut Provenance IG. Are those to be understood as nice-to-have additional guidance on top of US Core - in terms of scope they seem to be within scope for the rule ? Other Argonaut IGs seem to be out of scope: provider Directory (STU3), scheduling, CDS Hooks, Questionnaires (based on SDC), Subscriptions (draft).<br>
And: is CDS Hooks actually referenced/used in US Core ?</p>

<p>Thank you. One person rolled their eyes when reading my question - please remember that as a European I'm having to deal with dozens of different sets of legislations and "final rules", one or more for each European country (and elsewhere), so this US stuff is just another one in a loooong series. It's difficult to keep abreast if one isn't directly involved in the creation of a set of specs. ;-)</p>
<p>So one other final verification question on CMS, if I may: DaVinci Payer Data Exchange (PDex) US Drug Formulary STU 1 , is in-scope for the initial phase (right?), as is the FHIR Bulk Data Access Implementation Guide v1.0.0 (under CMS rules, not just under ONC rules) ?</p>

<p>The challenges of emoji-based communication -- I'm guessing that the eye roll emoji reaction was intended to express something like "I'm not sure, so I'm averting my eyes and looking for someone over on there in the corner who might know". You're doing a heroic job to keep track of all this, René!</p>

<p>For bulk data: as you point out this is required by ONC, for EHR vendors. I don't believe it's required for payors by the CMS rule -- but it'd be great to hear some confirmation, because overall I am less familiar here.</p>

<p>Yeah, as one of those folks, what I meant was "I'm looking at this" i.e. "interested in the question and what folks have to say." Apologies for cultural confusion.</p>

<p>OK, my take up to now, using a MURAL (you can use an anonymous login when prompted): <a href="https://app.mural.co/t/firely9202/m/firely9202/1598084038483/421d21a45b6ed7f44428f38374259edfdd9d6469">https://app.mural.co/t/firely9202/m/firely9202/1598084038483/421d21a45b6ed7f44428f38374259edfdd9d6469</a> - part of the problem the rule isn't necessarily defined in terms of IGs (which is what happens in most countries), but that it's a set of requirements which has to be met by various groups/projects creating IGs. Groups/projects may have conflicting ideas as to what IGs one should implement to conform to the published rules. That's probably the reason as to why I'm seeing conflicting lists. </p>
<p>Anyway, the MURAL contains the IGs that seem to be a 'SHALL implement'. I'm aware that this glosses over some of the API rules currently not covered by any IG, but for educational purposes it's ok to cover the essential parts (remember the 80%), and "leave the remaining stuff / requirements" to the reader. As a trainer you can get away with that, not so as an implementer ;-)</p>
