<p>I'm wondering how folks would approach mapping a USCore Patient record, when handed a "RACE" field that looks like this (I believe this is how the Social Security Administration codes things):</p>
<p>RACE<br>
LABEL: Beneficiary Race Code<br>
DESCRIPTION: The race of the beneficiary.<br>
SHORT NAME: RACE<br>
LONG NAME: BENE_RACE_CD<br>
TYPE: CHAR<br>
LENGTH: 1<br>
SOURCE: CMS Common Medicare Environment (CME)<br>
VALUES: 0 = Unknown<br>
1 = White<br>
2 = Black<br>
3 = Other<br>
4 = Asian<br>
5 = Hispanic<br>
6 = North American Native<br>

<p>It doesn't really map cleanly to <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet-omb-race-category.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet-omb-race-category.html</a>, which is a USCore required field. The "5 = Hispanic" code, in particular.</p>

<p>I'm inclined to recommend we just map it to UNK, and either include this SSA value set as a separate Coding or in a separate ethnicity field/extension/whatever.</p>

<p>I'm also curious, though, why <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet-omb-race-category.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet-omb-race-category.html</a> doesn't include other "null" flavors, such as "UNC   (un-encoded)". Per the spec, us using "UNK" here isn't strictly correct.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192789">@Karl M. Davis</span> Regarding the mapping, I agree it seems that these CMS codes do not align with what OMB has decided is a "Race." What you have is what OMB would call a combination of Race <em>and</em> Ethnicity.  Believe me when I tell you this is a loaded issue - try googling "OMB race and ethnicity." There was lots of discussion on how to ask the two questions and <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/newsroom/press-kits/2018/paa/2018-paa-presentation-race-question.pdf">for the 2020 census</a> they decided to stay with two answers, so your essentially combined set does not map well.  </p>
<p>One solution is to build a mapping table that records either an Ethnicity if the response is #5, or a Race if it is anything else. When you record one of those profiles, you could consider creating a default instance of the other profile with something like UNK but I see that is not available in the Ethnicity value set which is surprising. I think this is worth discussing at the USRSC or Cross-WG to come up with a solution. Likely USRSC as this would be a US Core conformance issue. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191410">@Brett Marquard</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192672">@Floyd Eisenberg</span></p>

<p>I personally have never seen this set of codes -every time I fill out  form it is the omb race choices and the hispanic and non-hispanic choice and I don't want to touch it with a ten foot pole. </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> I was saying that since his list maps to two profiles, a single answer would make an instance of one of those profiles and the other could be an instance of "UNK" as the value. Just a thought.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192789">@Karl M. Davis</span> I think this might best be discussed at Cross Project WG (CPG) but it means crafting an example to indicate if the approach makes sense. Did you understand my suggestion, which btw, I'm not sure is possible or how you would specify it in an IG. I'd assume that if you just put it into a specifica implementation, you'd do this all behind the scenes. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192672">@Floyd Eisenberg</span> - do you agree about going to CPG?</p>
