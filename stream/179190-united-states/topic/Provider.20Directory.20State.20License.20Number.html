<p>Any suggestions on how to include a provider state license number? Most likely I will use Practitioner.identifier but unsure of the system uri. It was suggested to use type.txt to provide a description of both the type of license and the jurisdiction. Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>Also, I am looking for any other resources, groups, chats to join to become FHIR proficient for a provider directory <br>
Thank you!</p>

<p>I think Practitioner.qualification is the proper place to record license details. From the definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, a medical license issued by a medical board authorizing the practitioner to practice medicine within a certain locality.</p>

<p>I have brought this up before.  There is a bunch of <a href="http://build.fhir.org/identifier-registry.html">US Centric identifiers</a> in the FHIR Specification.   I am not sure the IG is the best place for this type of information however, but rather some sort central registry.  Also creating system uris seems to be an area of some contention and I am not sure what the process is for that.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span>  may have more experience here.</p>

<p>These are classic namingsystem things. Process is to talk to HTA but someone will need to do the work of creating them but HTA can reach out to the entity responsible to begin the process of determining identifiers and metadata.</p>

<p>Except that we don't necessarily want the URLs to point to sites owned by the responsible organization - because many aren't capable of establishing permalinks.  Also, we're probably talking about close to 1000 naming systems here.  (Every state * every authoritative licensing/regulatory body for any medically affiliated practice - from acupuncture to veterinary medicine.)  I'm pretty sure the HTA doesn't want to engage with that many organizations and try to drive all of those conclusions to a logical end.  Plus, you'd end up with a completely inconsistent set of URLs - both within states and within disciplines.  I'd <em>strongly</em> advise that you just define an algorithmic basis for defining HL7-hosted sids that you can use as canonical URLs for all of the possible license numbers that could exist.  Then register all the ones that you know do exist.  The NamingSystem instances can then have descriptions that point to whatever the sponsoring organization currently is and the appropriate website for that identifier (if any).  It'll take a bit of discussion, but should be something you could get figured out in a few months.  (Best of luck to the HTA getting even 1/4 of them landed in a year - and they wouldn't be anywhere close to implementer friendly.)</p>

<p>According to the spec  for the value set found here: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-identifier-type.html#definition">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-identifier-type.html#definition</a> "MD Medical License number"  so MD is the code used for Medical License . We were planning to use the state of jurisdiction and it works out well for the following DC example <a href="/user_uploads/10155/IGpabrOMOTVPxjJiBgNLzaPr/image.png">image.png</a> <br>
but for Maryland or for the cases that we don't have a state it could be confusing. MD could be Medical Doctor, Maryland, and/or in FHIR simply Medical License Number. Any suggestions on how to better  represent this data: <a href="/user_uploads/10155/XisWMbatCasPY7FSQeafvOzo/image.png">image.png</a> <br>

<p>Agree.

<p>IF you make up a system URI then it needs to be shared  - hence the approach Lloyd and I discussed. If you do things on your own  things can get lost and be incomplete. But it's expedient...</p>

<p>Identifier.type.text can't be used for computation.  From type.coding, you can know that it's a license identifier, but not from what jurisdiction.  The type.text just conveys that information to a human.  To do a full computable match, a system is needed - and it needs to be one that everyone uses consistently - which is why there's a need for a process to determine (and publicly post) the URIs for all of the various license namespaces that exists.  Until that happens, full computable matching isn't going to be possible.</p>

<p>"license": "G3455",<br>
  "license_state": "CA",<br>
  "credentials": "MD",<br>
  "specialty": "Family Medicine",</p>
<p>Reading this thread, it seems like license would be qualifications.identifier, license_state is covered by the PlanNet extension, MD could be qualifications.code.text, and speciality another qualifications.code.text. Is that right?</p>
