<p>US Core Procedure.status is 1..1 and the value set used is required binding with values such as in-progress, not-done, etc. <br>
US Core Procedure.Performed[x] is also 1..1<br>
<strong>What are implementers doing about the procedure.performed element when the procedure status is not completed?</strong><br>
Seems clinically incorrect to use a DAR extension on procedure.performed (description is "When the procedure was performed") if the procedure status is not completed.</p>

<p>That's an interesting observation.  If you leave off <code>performed[x]</code> for a <code>not-done</code> procedure then your instance won't conform to US Core Procedure -- but maybe that's OK?  Does US Core care about procedures that were not actually performed?</p>

<p>The procedure.status values implies they do. if they don't they should limit the status value set to "completed" only.</p>

<p>Looks like you submitted <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-33243">FHIR#33243</a> - which I think I agree with.</p>
