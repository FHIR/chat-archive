<p>I'm trying to use the MeasureReport resource to represent the results of calculating various <a href="https://qpp.cms.gov/mips/quality-requirements">QPP MIPS</a> measures. There are some attributes of these measures that don't fit squarely within the Measure/MeasureReport resources, including multiple scoring methodologies (reporting rate vs. performance rate) and boolean scoring (attestation). Are there any publicly available standards for representing MIPS measures/scores?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="251487">@Matt Rouhana</span> , we've been working towards supporting MIPS measures but didn't have concrete examples from stakeholders to work with. If you're working through some, we'd be happy to add those to the QM/DEQM IGs to make sure they are supported. Would you be willing to come to a CQI meeting (Fridays at 1:00 ET) to discuss further? If you can't make that time, I'd be happy to jump on a call and discuss. The short answer is we think QM/DEQM should support MIPS measures, and if they can't we'd like to understand why so we can support them.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span> thanks for following up. I've got a standing meeting at that time on Fridays - I'll PM you about setting up time to discuss further.</p>
