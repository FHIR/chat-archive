<p>right PATIENT<br>
right MEDICATION to be given<br>
right REASON (this may be a diagnosis/symptom) - the nurse has to verify that the patient should indeed receive the meds intravenously<br>
right DOSE - what is the patient's weight<br>
right ROUTE<br>
right FREQUENCY<br>
right TIME/ DAY of order<br>
right SITE</p>
<p>We could ease the verification if we could use an Encounter resource to specify that a patient is associated with a pump. We could query for outstanding medication orders and pick the order that  is appropriate. That may be something interesting for *new* functionality not currently supported by IHE PCD.</p>

<p>Interesting ... thanks!   What is the source of this list?  I'm sure my friendly IHE pharmacist would stick to the basic 5?  And what is the difference between ROUTE and SITE?  FWIW - an interesting component would be to take these and bang them against a CDS system with a rule set that does (a) rights checking, and (b) "precision" rights checking for PATIENT based on their allergy list, genomic profile, etc.</p>

<p>Nursing education ... The FDA refers to  "five rights" some sources include "right DOCUMENTATION".</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191968">@Ioana Singureanu</span> FWIW - On the IHE PCD Infusion Pump call today, I mentioned the 5+3 (or 8) Rights ... looked at the diagram that you posed on the FHIR Connectathon 2016-09 page, and asked them if they had any other exposure to this from other venues ... bottom line:  No.  Maybe it was the audience, but no real response ...</p>

<p>Then we looked closer at the diagram (at the bottom of <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201609_Device_Integration" target="_blank" title="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201609_Device_Integration">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201609_Device_Integration</a>) and as we tried to interpret it ... the confusion only increased - especially given the duplication of numbers.  Is there text around this graphic that would explain the flows and duplicated numbers and how they relate to the 5+3 Rights?  (other than those being identified on the diagram)? </p>
