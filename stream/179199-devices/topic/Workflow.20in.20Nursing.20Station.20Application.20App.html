<p>I want to discuss about the workflow of an application which monitor patients in an ICU displaying vitals like Heart Rate, Body Temperature etc.<br>
Presently, I am planning like, for each vitals query the Observation periodically and take the latest observation based on date time. Please share your thoughts on this approach OR if any better workflow available for such an application?</p>

<p>Well there are lots of possibilities here, and what you propose seems to me to be straightforward and natural for a lot of situations, but you need to factor in the specifics of your use case: what is the scope and scale (small unit, lots of units, big hospital system, and so forth), the frequency of observation reporting, the persistence needs, and the capabilities of the various systems involved (transaction throughput, storage, etc.). Meeting your needs in a typical FHIR REST environment can range from pretty easy for a reasonable number of patients with moderate monitoring needs, to pretty challenging to meet for large deployments (hundreds or thousands of beds with a lot of high-acuity patients and a lot of O.R. suites). What are you envisioning here?</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>
The planned one is a prototype where there is less than 10 patients maximum in an ICU.</p>
