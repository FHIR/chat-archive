<p>Hi All, Some devices need maintenance be done periodically and to support that we need to record maintenance due date<br>
so what is best way to record device maintenance due date for a device?<br>
an Extension or task resource or Observation resource?</p>

<p>My inclination would be to start with an extension, likely backbone, with the relevant data you are interested in to indicate due data and submit a JIRA to that end.  For the documentation of the maintenance actually performed that may perhaps be an Observation profile to do so.  I'd not be inclined to use Task, other than to perhaps manage the performance of the maintenance.  I could see a counter argurment to create a Task with a future date to reflect upcoming maintenance that is then actually performed and yields an Observation against the Task/Device, but would like to then understand what the additional benefit is vs. doing so within the Device itself (e.g., if very frequent, perhaps).</p>
