<p>Looking at the FHIR PHD IG and the FHIR PoCD IG, I see the latter always uses DeviceMetric (i.e. profiles state that Observation.device is a ref to DeviceMetric) and the PHD profiles never do (there is no profile on DeviceMetric, and Observation.device is just the base ref to (Device|DeviceMetric). Is there any reason for this? At first sight, DeviceMetric seems to apply to both cases equally, and either always using DM or never using it looks like the most consistent approach.</p>

<p>As far as I understand it, PHD deliberately uses a more simplified data model (no DeviceMetric, no Device hierarchy), which should fit nicely to the simpler nature of PHD's.</p>

<p>Yes, that sounds reasonable. I had the impression that PoCD gets updated more frequently, so was wondering whether DeviceMetric was still to come for PHD.</p>
