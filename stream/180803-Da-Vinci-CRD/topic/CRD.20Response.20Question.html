<p>Hello<br>
As we are implementing the CRD use case with payers and providers, we are finding that some of the payers would like to send a CoverageEligibiltyResponse object along with response. An example here is shown below. The client would receive and store it somewhere for auditing and other purposes as needed.</p>
<p>Are there any issues with this response ? Please let us know. </p>
<p>{<br>

        {<br>
          "summary": "Authorization not required for Codeine prescription",<br>

          "source":<br>

<p>Hey Nagesh, the intent of the card's <a href="https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/1.0/#card-attributes" target="_blank" title="https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/1.0/#card-attributes">source attribute</a> is to optionally provide a human-readable web url that the user can access in a browser from the card to better understand the justification of the guidance. Other cds services have used this field to link to an academic journal article, or a CDC defined set of recommendations, etc.</p>

<p>I understand that "some of the payers would like to send a CoverageEligibiltyResponse object along with response", but am less clear on:<br>
1) if providers are able to receive or use this link and <br>
2) how this source link improves the user's experience</p>

<p>Good question, the current explanation i have heard is only for auditing purpose (it contains all the information that was sent) and received along with the authorization decision that was made.</p>
