<p>Now that the tickets and votes are in for CRD/DTR/PAS, what will the ballot reconciliation process look like? <br>
Will we be starting up the Wednesday and Friday burden reduction calls again to talk through tickets? <br>
Is there any sort of timeline in mind or is it just a matter of however long it takes to triage everything? <br>

<p>We'll be going through the issues on the calls.  Where the issues seem non-controversial, we'll put proposed dispositions for block vote.  Others we'll take up on calls.  There's no specific timeline, other than "as soon as we can". :)</p>
