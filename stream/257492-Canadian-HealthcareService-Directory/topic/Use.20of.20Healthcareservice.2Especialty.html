<p>Is the intended use of HealthcareService.specialty rigidly tied to the idea of clinical specialties of practitioners?</p>
<p>We have a desire to add a concept of "specialties" to a service that may be something different, and i'm trying to figure out if we should use the specialty field (which has a preferred value set), or take another approach:</p>
<p>For long term care: Reunification bed, smoking bed, etc...<br>
For orthopaedic specialists: hand, foot, shoulder, etc...<br>
For physiotherapist: motor vehicle accidents, sports injury, acupuncture, etc...<br>
For meals on wheels: Hot meals, cold meals, etc...</p>
<p>I think of these as more detailed information that is a bit more precise than what a "Service listings" in a directory might be. Kind of like searching for a hair-dresser, but only some will do a perm. </p>
<p>I'm currently considering the following alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a "Service options" extension</li>
<li>Use "HealthcareService.Characteristics"</li>
<li>Use Healthcareservice.type (which is already being used for the main taxonomy classification like "orthopaedic specialist", "physiotherapist", "meals on wheels". </li>
<li>Use Healthcareservice.specialty, (throwing the preferred valueset out the window.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>This doesn't seem like a Canadian-specific question?  Might be best to ask on the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179166" href="/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers">#implementers</a> stream</p>

<p>Should re-post it or does tagging <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179166" href="/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers">#implementers</a>  do the trick?</p>

<p>I'd re-post.  I doubt most implementers would want to subscribe here to participate in the discussion.</p>

<p>I would have suggested that characteristics would be appropriate there.</p>
