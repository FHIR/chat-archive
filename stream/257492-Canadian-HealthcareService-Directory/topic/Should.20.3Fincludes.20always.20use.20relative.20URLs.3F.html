<p>if I "GET Healthcareservice/id=123&amp;_include=HealthcareService:organization</p>
<p>In the bundle that returns, in my HealthcareService resource should the reference to an Organization object always be RELATIVE (i.e. "Organization/876") because it's included in the bundle, or can/should it be an absolute reference to the Organization resource (with the baseUrl in the path)?</p>
<p>Note: This is for broad multi-system web interoperability.</p>

<p>References can always be absolute.  They're allowed to be relative if referencing and referenced resource are on the same endpoint.  Relative is a bit easier in terms of signatures if you're porting content across servers.  (It's also shorter)</p>
