<p>This is the first message in the Canadian FHIR HealthcareService directory stream. This stream has been created to support ongoing discussions regarding a standard approach to health service directory interoperability in Canada. </p>
<p>Today we are running a workshop (35 registrants!) to work through our first draft. There is a google doc here that we are working through together:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YRlghtBx9Pwi6o13lvX26esKaR2S8OLRdc-MIIVeM5s/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YRlghtBx9Pwi6o13lvX26esKaR2S8OLRdc-MIIVeM5s/edit#</a></p>
<p>This document contains questions to be discussed, a draft profile for HealthcareService, links to previous useful Zulip chats, and more.</p>
