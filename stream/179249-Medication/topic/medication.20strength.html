<p>Given that I am working on a Patient entered medications app... not a pharmacist, or prescribing clinician. What is the intention in the MedicationStatement for recording the strength of a medication per dose? I am getting really confused. There is some strength information baked into the rxNorm terminology; is that all that is needed?</p>

<p>Typically strength is implicit in the medication code.  If not, it's conveyed using Medication and conveying the active ingredient quantity(ies).  Though I believe there was a proposal for a "strength description" extension for those systems that only have a string.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191759">@Melva Peters</span> ?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> is your question about why there is a doseAndRate backbone in the dosage type?  Often the strength of the medication in the tablet or capsule is included in the name of the medication from the code.  There may be situations where one strength is prescribed or dispensed but the patient is to take a different amount.  For example, 4mg tablets may be dispensed but the actual dose that the patient is to take is 8mg - this can be conveyed in the Dosage.doseAndRate.doseQuantity</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191759">@Melva Peters</span> , I am looking for the most likely model. Yes, I do understand dispensed might be different than prescribed, but I would expect the patient would be entering the dispensed details, then indicating how many of them they are taking etc...  Surely there will be exceptions, I am not looking at them.</p>
