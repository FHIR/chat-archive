<p>The Da Vinci Project has determined that certain changes should be applied to update the STU1 (1.0.1) specification to address issues and concerns raised by implementers and the community at large. These changes have been reviewed by the sponsoring Pharmacy Work Group and have been approved for a peer review in order to create an STU Update.</p>
<p>Specification Location:<br>
The changes have been applied to the version of the specification located in the continuous build at: <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-formulary/">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-formulary/</a> . Note that no changes will be permitted to the continuous build during the peer review.</p>
<p>Scope:</p>
<p>The scope of the review is limited to the specific changes made to this version of the specification and listed on the home page of the specification.<br>
Review is sought only for the changes related to issues addressed in this release (which can be found here: <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/issues/?filter=15602">https://jira.hl7.org/issues/?filter=15602</a>). Jira tickets related to any other portions of the specification may be considered for a later update or ballot.<br>
Voting and comments:</p>
<p>The peer review is open to any interested party via a submitted Jira ticket at <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/">https://jira.hl7.org/</a> for any changes/corrections which should be considered for the material being updated. </p>
<p>Peer Review Period:</p>
<p>The peer review will be conducted from September 1, 2021 through September 15, 2021 (Eastern US time). After the Peer Review period the Da Vinci Project and HL7 Pharmacy WG will consider submitted comments for the final STU update version (anticipated to be STU 1.1.0).</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration and participation in the peer review.</p>
