<p>I am working in the USA Veterans Admin on their Patient Portal. One of the features offered today to a Veteran is that they get to see a picture of the drug that was actually dispensed to them. This picture helps them identify which of the various pills they have is the pill of interest. This picture helps them identify to their clinican the pills they are taking. This picture helps their spouse or other helper understand the pills they need to give when. <br>
When I look at the current FHIR Medications, I don't find a clear way to identify a picture of the drug as it was dispensed. There is MedicationKnowledge that seems useful, but it seems to be closer to what was Ordered. I need linkage to what was Dispensed.</p>

<p>MedicationKnowledge is agnostic on whether the medication was ordered, dispensed, or administered.  It just describes a medication and the knowledge items around that medication.</p>

<p>if you want a "catalog" image of drug B, you use the medicationKnowledge of drug B which should be on the server somewhere.<br>
if however you want a picture of your drug B (e.g. you want to take a photo of the individual bag or bottle that the drug was dispensed, for proof, or for whatever other reason, then you could use a contained a MedicationKnowledge (or an extension) with that photo.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191682">@Richard Townley-O'Neill</span> It'd be drugCharacteristic.valueBase64Binary, though I agree it'd be useful for there to be a specific example code for 'image'.   Medication is a weird duck.  Sometimes it's used as the contained resource for custom compounds, IV concoctions, etc. and in those cases, an image is totally incorrect.  In other cases, it's used for a drug masterfile and in those cases, an image is potentially reasonable.  But, realistically, if you're going to capture an image for the drug, you'll probably have most of the other knowledge-base stuff too (indications, contraindications, recommended doses, etc.)  Which means that you're really talking about MedicationKnowledge.</p>

<p>The image in the case of the VA is close to a catalog image. It is not an actual picture of the pills given. BUT it is very specific to the look of the pills dispensed at the pharamacy that dispensed that drug. I think the most likely case is where there are various possibilities that could fulfil the ordered medication, so that the image is what actually got dispensed. This might be different manufacture, might be because of pill strength available within that pharmacy, etc....   SImply recognizing that various pharmacy have various stock.</p>

<p>Yes, currently we have MedicationKnowledge pointing to a Medication, but a Medication does not point to a MedicationKnowledge.  You'll have to use an extension for now, but I'll raise this as a tracker item.  I'm thinking it would go like this:  [Dispense|Request|Administration|Statement].medicationReference -&gt; Medication.associatedMedicationKnowledge -&gt; MedicationKnowledge.</p>

<p>The dispensed medication.code SHOULD be the detailed code for the specific manufactured product.  The only time I can see that not being specific to a particular image would be if the manufacturer changed the appearance of the same formulation - some code systems wouldn't change the code if that occurred, but that would be rare.

<p>i think that a medication can correspond to several definitions (as any other product), but i am not sure a 0..* is the best option. A medication can have not "some" definitions, but "a speciific set of definitions" Perhaps you have a different model in mind or different requirements, so i am not worried there, i know there will be a solution. <br>
I just wanted to say that "associatedMedicationKnowledge is not straightforward, and "definition" would be better.  Especially since MedicationKnowledge is a good resource but with an unclear name, and we do not want to spread that to some attributes.</p>

<p>MedicationKnowledge is not a definition of a medication in the traditional sense.  It is the knowledge of a product that a formulary or knowledgebase contains.  Thus I can send multiple resources corresponding to different formularies or knowledgebases.  I could also send multiple resources corresponding to different levels of information.  For example, if my Medication was AG-Amoxicillin 500mg Tablet, I could conceivably have the following associated knowledge resources: AG-Amoxicillin, Amoxicillin Trihydrate, and Amoxicillin.  We have seen a knowledgebase where some of the information is inherited from higher levels.  So the Amoxicillin contains knowledge about the interactions and indications, Amoxicillin Trihydrate gives further information about the specific salt and the AG-Amoxicillin gives information such as image, scoring, size, etc.</p>

<p>That is what i mean by definition. And "knowledgebase" is what I had to call "catalog" (or Formulary, or Livret Therapeutique). Marketeers call it knowledgebase.<br>
Agree with the multiple links - i had to implement just that (and the "logistic product definition" on top of it), so I am happy to see that requirement. Still, <br>
a) we should review the name. MedicationKnowledge is easy to confuse with "all we know about this patient's medication history" - hence my adjacent question to differentiate medicine/medication (médicament / médication).<br>
b) to make that graph, it may b ethat we use 0..*, i just think it is not the only possibility and I would not anchor to a design just yet.<br>
Just to be clear - there are several options, and I agree a medication can have its definition originating from different sources. How we fix that, is of secondary importance.</p>

<p>If the only thing that changed was the appearance and the regulator didn't force a change of 'code', there'd be nothing "new" to have a distinct MedicationKnowledge for.  Linkage to MedicationKnowledge in existing systems is exclusively via code.  No systems point to medication knowledge in sources like First Databank by anything other than the medication code.  So we can't reasonably expect systems to change that behavior with FHIR - nor can we expect knowledge sources to change their behavior either.</p>

<p>Catalogue is a different thing.  It implies "what's available".  That's not a function of the knowledge resource, it's a function of what a particular organization chooses to put in its "list".  (And the question of "what's available" can be highly dynamic.)</p>

<p>The code <em>is</em> the link for all existing software.  It's not going to change just because FHIR might work differently.

There could be MedicationKnowledge entries at any of these levels.  However, if Virbac changes the color of the pill and the FDA doesn't choose to issue it a different CUI, then the drug knolwedge bases would still attach the new image to "Biomox 100 MG Oral Tablet" (791942) as there isn't a more granular code to tie it to.</p>

<p>Hence why I started this thread that there is a need for the image of the "Dispensed" drug. I think MedicalKnowledge can be used, but the linkage is not through the RxNorm code, it must be more specific in some cases.</p>

<p>How could it be with anything more specific?  In the dispense record, you'll just have a code that reflects the dispensed drug.  Unless the pharmacist takes a picture of the specific drug they're dispensing to each patient at each dispense (which I've never heard of a pharmacist doing), the only thing you can do is look up the code for the dispensed drug  in the knowledgebase.  (Note that the dispensed code is typically different from the prescribed code and is more detailed in terms of manufacturer, formulation, etc.)</p>

<p>I think you might be agreeing. I am all for use of MedicalKnowledge as a catalog of actual drugs with a reference image of that specific one. I am simply indicating that this is more refined than RxNorm, as it must also cover manufacturing differences.</p>

<p>The pharmacy knows the exact drug they dispensed. This is what I am looking to flow back. I have outlined many times, and others have confirmed, that what gets dispensed will be chemically identical to what was ordered; but might look different due to manufacturing differences etc. The LOOK of what was DISPENSED is what I am looking for.

<p>in general, there are N levels of granularity, which are overlapping, not harmonized across countries. Hospital pharmacies prepare their own products and new codes emerge. Some levels of granularity can be in a dispense, others not. Reducing it to RxNorm and NDC serves to demonstrate that we can (normally) retrieve the picture of the dispensed product from a catalog for pre-manufactured products. <br>
As long as we conceive other codes, other granularities, the solution will still work.</p>
