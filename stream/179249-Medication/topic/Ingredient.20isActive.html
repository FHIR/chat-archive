<p>I understood there was a rather old agreement that medication.isActive should be "role". IIRC, the discussion was held at EGM in Madrid, but perhaps there was no follow-up. This seems a straightforward, common case, and I was surprised to see that while MedKnowledge has this, Medication doesn't. Has this been discussed?</p>

<p>i just checked Jira and there was no issue raised to do so.  With the use of the Ingredient resource (that is no longer being used), maybe no one thought we needed this?  In any case, if you think that is a good thing, please raise a Jira issue.</p>
