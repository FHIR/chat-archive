<p>We are exposing planned medication dispensations to a dispensation machine who then dispense the correct drugs and amount. What would be the best way of providing the planned dispensations to the machine? With planned dispensation I mean e.g. pills to be given to a patient which need to be prepared, based on an medication order.</p>
<p>Some options we have discussed:</p>
<p><strong>Option 1 - List resource</strong><br>
Use the List resource with a code=plannedDispensations. The List would include entries of type MedicationRequest. Ideally we would also do some profiling on the MedicationRequest entries adapting them for the dispensation use case (not sure if you can bind specific profiles of the entry resources to the List.code value?).</p>
<p><strong>Option 2 - Medication Request</strong><br>
Use the MedicationRequest resource directly without a list. We would probably have a profile specifically for adapting the MedicationRequest to the dispensation use case as well.</p>
<p>Maybe there are other better options?</p>
<p>Any recommendations of how to in the best way expose planned dispensations?</p>

<p>I agree with using MedicationRequest for the details of each medication to be given to a nominated patient.<br>
I agree with using List if you want to identify the set of MedicationRequests.</p>
