<p>Hi all, we're considering holding a Birds-of-a-feather session during the FHIR Connectathon in San Antonio to discuss imaging access for consumers, similar to the discussion held in Baltimore. This has nothing to do with FHIRcast, other than we expect many of the same people to be involved. Please respond if you're interested in being part of the discussion. (My preference is to hold the session on Sunday afternoon, but please let me know your preferred time as well.)</p>
