<p>During the connectathon, we talked through some of the differences between and a potential goal of harmonization of the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/concalls/CallDetails.aspx?concall=49745">FHIRcast websockets</a> "sub-protocol" and that being introduced in <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/channels.html#websockets">FHIR Subscriptions</a>. </p>
<p>My take is that Subscriptions approach is more thorough, and also more complicated and more difficult to implement.</p>

<p>That sounds like a fair assessment.  We tried to keep implementation as simple as possible, but with the additional constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>a single connection must support multiple subscriptions</li>
<li>the server needs a way to periodically (as they determine) enforce authorization</li>
<li>renewals should be allowed without reconnecting, to reduce the possibility of missed events</li>
</ul>
<p>Having done a naive implementation, it didn't feel <em>too</em> complex.  I can see becoming a bit more difficult when the websocket endpoint is disassociated with the token-generation endpoint, since you need to sort out a method of communication there.  But, in that architecture you need a mechanism to feed it notifications anyway and it is unidirectional - the websocket server doesn't generally* need to communicate back.</p>
<p>*Unless the server wants to keep track of notification status and connected clients outside the websocket handler service and there isn't anything in place to do that already.</p>
<p>With all of that said, I would be happy to discuss any revisions/ideas that could help them align better.</p>

<p>The main question here is whether the design rationales used by Gino also apply to FHIRcast. The main requirement is the first one: "a single connection must support multiple subscriptions". Is this a general requirement that needs to  be taken into account also by FHIRcast<br>
?</p>
