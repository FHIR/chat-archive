<p>Hi,<br>
I’m getting started on a FHIRcast Adapter for legacy apps:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/fhircast/fhircast-adapter" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/fhircast/fhircast-adapter">https://github.com/fhircast/fhircast-adapter</a><br>
I would appreciate contribution and/or input on useful features.<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194183">@John Silva</span>  :  I was thinking to put in code to interact with the iSite viewer interface since that cannot be done with PowerShell alone.  Any objections on Philips side?<br>
Thanks to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191864">@Isaac Vetter</span>  for his support,<br>
Martin</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192821">@Martin Bellehumeur</span>  - I do not know enough about the iSite product so I can't give any guidance here.  (I work with the Acute care products).   Maybe <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192099">@Chris Melo</span>  can help since I believe he knows folks on the iSite team.</p>

<p>Thanks.  I know the iSIte interface, just wanted to make sure I don't do this without your knowledge.  Our RIS has an old Visual Basic bridge for iSite (developer changed to another job ) and I'm hoping to inspire them to modernize.</p>

<p>I have to check with management at Nuance. I don't know if they want me in Cleveland or San Antonio!</p>
<p>I developed a desktop integration for Powerscribe360 with iSiteRadiology. They have a very robust web API. They could easily build a FHIRCast wrapper around it. All of our code is done in javascript.</p>

<p>Just watched the demo video, nice!   It got me to thinking --- I like your adapter approach; provides flexibility.  It also got me thinking -- what if there was a CCOW to FHIRcast adapter!!  (of course not all CCOW operations can be done in FHIRcast, but maybe some can.  Maybe this could provide a bridge, of sorts, to existing CCOW-compliant systems?   I'm thinking only of the CCOW client side [Context Participant], not the server side [Context Manager])</p>

<p>Is there open-source ccow code somewhere?</p>

<p>HI,<br>
I’ve looked into it and I won’t be doing a CCOW interface.  None of the Siemens products are using CCOW.  Here I’m trying to fix a current issue of our RIS while bringing them into FHIRcast.  I think there is a fine line where we don’t want to encourage products to keep their old interfaces.</p>

<p>That makes sense.  I was just thinking of wa way to bridge the systems that might already be CCOW-enabled, though maybe there are fewer and fewer of these today.    I did search for "CCOW open source" and did find this one:  <a href="https://github.com/jonathanbp/ccow.contextmanager" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/jonathanbp/ccow.contextmanager">https://github.com/jonathanbp/ccow.contextmanager</a></p>

<p>Interesting.  Maybe a nodejs hub that supports both FHIRcast and CCOW clients.  Something to keep in mind...<br>
For now, I think my holiday project  will be a FHIRcast plug-in for Osirix/Horos.</p>
