<p>Hi, I’m prototyping the new standard for AI workflow and to me it would be natural to use the FHIRcast hub as a proxy to the ai-workflow-orchestrator.<br>
That way the clients could create requests and receive updates the same way they handle other desktop workflow/integration messages.  They would also be informed on AI requests made by other apps and receive update (if they chose to subscribe to those events.<br>
If you are working on the same or know someone who is, please reach out to me.  It would be nice to make a proposal to add those events with more than one viewpoint.<br>
