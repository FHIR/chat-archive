<p>Hi All!<br>
I wanted to start a conversation and gather perspective on Hub handling of event notification sync errors from subscribers.  In particular, I am interested scenarios where a sync error from a subscriber should result in some sort of notification to the end-user.  Does a particular level of declared Severity translate to a level of importance high enough to warrant a user notification on the Hub?  Perhaps only Fatal and Error level sync-errors should result in user notification on the Hub because they have the greatest potential for risk?<br>
And in terms of the content of such a Hub notification, would a subscribing app expect that the value of the diagnostics element on the OperationOutcome resource of the sync error be displayed?  Would other contextual information derived from the notification that triggered the sync error also be helpful for end users when being notified of a sync error?</p>
<p>I am hoping to spur open-ended discussion around sync errors. Any thoughts on the questions posed would be greatly appreciated :)</p>
