<p>Not sure if this is the right forum to ask, but as far as I can tell, the FHIRCast spec says that to request a context change, an application should send a POST to the <code>hub.url</code> URL (the same endpoint as you use to subscribe/unsubscribe)</p>
<p>However, all the examples seem to append a topic identifier to the URL when sending context change requests.<br>
That is, to subscribe they POST to <a href="https://hub.example.com">https://hub.example.com</a>, and then to request a context change they POST to <a href="https://hub.example.com/someguid">https://hub.example.com/someguid</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, both the sandbox github code and the example code listings in the STU2 spec do this. I just can't find anywhere in the actual specification which <em>says</em> to use this separate endpoint.</p>
<p>So which is correct? Should the topic be appended to <code>hub.url</code> when requesting context change? And if so, can anyone point to where in the specification this is mandated?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hey Jasper -- wow, that's a great observation. The normative language of the specification takes precedence. I believe that the <code>hub.url</code> is the address to which context requests should be made, not <code>hub.url</code>/<code>hub.topic</code>. A careful reading of <a href="http://fhircast.org/specification/STU2/#request-context-change">the example in the spec</a> does show that the guid-looking path at which the context change request is made is different from previous examples of the hub.topic guid. Regardless, would you mind logging a jira issue against FHIRcast for this? As you describe, the current examples are misleading.</p>
