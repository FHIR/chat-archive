<p>one use-case from the CCOW days was a common use-case that covers an ambulatory exam room. Where a patient centric session would be maintained in the exam room, while many users logged in to enter data and logged out when they are done. I see a logout and a suspend event, but don't see if there is clear capability to support changing users while maintaining context like patient, episode, image, etc...  Is this a future use-case? Has it been an overlooked use-case? Or am I just not seeing how it would work?</p>

<p>Hey John, I think that we might have overlooked that scenario. It's a tricky one, becaues the process that establishes the subscription also identifies the user (OAuth).</p>
