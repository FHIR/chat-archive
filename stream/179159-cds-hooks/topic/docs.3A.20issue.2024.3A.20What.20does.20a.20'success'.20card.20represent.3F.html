<blockquote>
<p>The documentation does not make it clear what a card with an indicator of 'success' signifies. Does it signify that CDS was executed and there are no suggestions/warnings/information/etc? Or does it just mean that the CDS ran (i.e. it should be returned with basically every response and probably simply ignored by the consumer). What is the proper way to tell the consuming system that there were no suggestions/warnings/information? Note that this may be required and include extra information for supporting PAMA/etc.</p>
