<p>Would folks be interested in standardizing CDS Service aggregation?  Per <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193265">@Matt Varghese</span>'s comments in today's meeting, with regards to optimizing a call to a number of CDS Services.  One potential conflict comes up, also mentioned by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193265">@Matt Varghese</span>, regarding multiple cards being returned, where their service will merge the cards/suggestions into one card.</p>

<p>If you have multiple services on an endpoint that are listening for the same scenario and offering the same category/topic of guidance, it seems to make sense to combine them.  If there are variances in scenario or types of guidance provided, it may not make sense to combine them.  Perhaps one area of help here is to be clearer in advertising when that service should be invoked.  </p>
<p>The main thing I'm getting at is if there is the ability for the client to only trigger certain services in certain situations, combining the services into one endpoint has a trade-off of less client-side ability to opt in (or out) of services</p>
