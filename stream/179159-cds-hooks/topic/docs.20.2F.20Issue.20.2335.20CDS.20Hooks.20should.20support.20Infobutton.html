<blockquote>
<p>The HL7 Infobutton (Context aware knowledge retrieval) is a widely implemented standard for an EHR or other system to query an external clinical knowledgebase in realtime in a clinician's workflow. Contextual information (patient demographics, specific diagnosis, allergy, observation, etc) is included in the EHR's HTTP request. The knowledgebase's response is displayed to the clinician. </p>
<p>This is a specific use case of the CDS Hooks info card. Knowledgebases would benefit from having access to the caller's FHIR server, by receiving the OAuth access_token in the CDS Hooks request, the ability to return a full-featured SMART app, as well as the option of the more advanced remote CDS Hooks functionality .</p>
<p>We should consider building dedicated support of Infobutton in CDS Hooks. One approach would be to define an "infobutton" hook, that includes the existing key/value pairs defined by the HL7 Context aware knowledge retrieval (aka Infobutton) standard within the CDS Hooks request's context attribute. This could provide a straightforward path for platforms and knowledgebases to enhance their existing integrations to take advantages of the additional clinical data offered by an EHR's FHIR server, and other features.</p>
