<p>Hi guys, I have a question about FHIR references when returning a CDS-Hooks response and I would appreciate a little guidance. </p>
<p>So when the service returns the suggestion cards with an actions array those resources might have references between each other or references to existing resources in the context or on the EMR's FHIR server, is there any guidance on what those should look like or how a system should resolve them? I know there is specific instructions on batch create operations using FHIR Bundles, I'm wondering if there has been any discussion about this in CDS-Hooks. The references to the existing resources would probably take the same Resource/123, should the new references do this too, just with a temporary ID assigned by the CDS-service?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hey Travis - this isn't something that has come up before; I imagine because most of the suggestion work I've seen at the Connectathons are very basic/simple (eg, a single medication).</p>
<p>Others?</p>

<p>Yes I think it will be more of an issue when 'decisions' are in the spec, since suggestions seem to be much more intimately linked to the immediate context. But I would still love to hear if there has been any discussion of this - I didn't find any in GitHub.</p>
