<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191355">@Kevin Shekleton</span> , could you provide approval and perhaps guidance on posting the description below to the CDS Hooks Connectathon wiki? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span> suggested this would be an appropriate first step to generating interest and find EHR partners for the September Connectathon. Thank you. </p>
<p>"===Implement Potential Drug-Drug Interaction check using 1.0 spec===<br>
:'''Action''': With the medication-prescribe hook, the EHR sends a request that may include prefetch data to the CDS Service. The CDS Service may request additional data from the FHIR server then returns an array of Card(s) with associated suggestions. <br>
:'''Precondition''': A prefetch or FHIR server query for contextual data element (below) resources (e.g., MedicationDispense, MedicationAdministration, MedicationRequest, MedicationStatement, Patient, Observation, Condition). Preference for obtaining medication resources with prefetch query. <br>
:'''Success Criteria''': The EHR displays the appropriate Card response for the specified indicator element.<br>
:'''Bonus point''': The EHR supports Card actions (i.e., create, update, delete) relevant to drug-drug interactions that may include canceling the current drug order, substituting the current drug order, discontinuing a historical drug, and adding an additional non-drug order (e.g., lab). The EHR supports parsing the DetectedIssue resource as an extension to the CDS Hooks Card Attributes. The EHR supports medication-select – defined as the step when the provider selects the drug product (i.e., ingredient and strength) during order entry. <br>
''Specific data elements for Connectathon use case include: Current medications, Historical medications, Age, Serum digoxin, Serum creatinine, Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium, and History of Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed.''"</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196481">@Thomas Reese</span> - Sorry for the belated reply. Thanks for proposing this scenario. I've tweaked it slight and put it up on the <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201809_CDS_Hooks#Scenarios" target="_blank" title="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201809_CDS_Hooks#Scenarios">Wiki here</a>. Let me know if it looks OK to you.</p>
<p>Besides yourself, do you know who use you have interested in implementing this?</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191355">@Kevin Shekleton</span>  for putting it up on the wiki. We are looking for EHR vendors that are interested in participating at the Connectathon. We may have some interest from a drug knowledge vendor and a UPMC (Pitt) representative. If you know of others, please send them our way.</p>
