<p>This is request to add the following hooks to <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Proposed-Hooks" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Proposed-Hooks">https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Proposed-Hooks</a>:<br>
(Below is the rationale for this request)</p>
<p>procedure-request-create<br>
Purpose: This hook informs an external CDS service that the clinician has created a procedure request. The CDS service schedules procedures to performed based on the created procedure request.<br>
Contextual data: Required Patient, procedure request being created.<br>
{<br>
"name": "context",<br>
"resource": procedurerequest/123<br>
}</p>
<p>procedure-request-modify (this should include delete)<br>
Purpose: This hook informs an external CDS service that the clinician has modified a procedure request. The CDS service modifies the scheduled procedures based on the modified procedure request.<br>
Contextual data: Required Patient, procedure request being created.<br>
{<br>
"name": "context",<br>
"resource": procedurerequest/123;<br>
}</p>
<p>1. Patient comes out of an operation and is sent to a nursing care or t home (cost reduction)<br>
2. Clinician requires scheduled vitals collection hence created procedure request for the vital collection<br>
3. Above hooks invokes a cloud server, which obtains the details and Timing of the procedure request<br>
4. The cloud server coordinates with the gateway at home to collect the Vitals.</p>
<p>We look forward to your comments.</p>

<p>Good question -- What type of procedures do you believe this will work best for?  Watching some of the scheduling activities under <a href="https://github.com/argonautproject/scheduling" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/argonautproject/scheduling">Argonaut</a> I am not quite sure how you would select location, provider, time slot, etc.</p>
