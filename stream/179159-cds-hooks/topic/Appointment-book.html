<p>The pull request for a new candidate hook of "Appointment-book" has been accepted and the candidate hook can now be reviewed here: <a href="https://cds-hooks.org/hooks/appointment-book" target="_blank" title="https://cds-hooks.org/hooks/appointment-book">https://cds-hooks.org/hooks/appointment-book</a></p>
<p>This thread is to encourage discussion of the proposed hook.  It was initiated as part of the Da Vinci Coverage Requirements Discovery (CRD) project, but is intended to be generally applicable.  It allows decision support services to provide recommendations at the time a new appointment is being scheduled.   Services could do a range of things - check if a patient will be due for certain tests or other interventions (based on registration in a clinical trial, general care protocol, etc.) and, if so, recommend adjusting the appointment to allow time for them; proposing orders that should be issued so that certain diagnostic tests can be completed before the appointment occurs, identify if a scheduled follow-up is deemed to be "too soon" based on the patient's coverage, etc.</p>
