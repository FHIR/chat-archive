<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cds-hooks/8Yg5kjpFh34/qeiRXXcABAAJ" target="_blank" title="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cds-hooks/8Yg5kjpFh34/qeiRXXcABAAJ">Ken Kawamoto pointed out</a> that in our documentation for the <code>medication-prescribe</code> hook  we state that the context is "The set of proposed medication prescriptions".</p>
<p>This makes sense that we would support multiple medication prescriptions as context. However, in our example and in prototype implementations, I know we've only ever sent a single medication prescription as the context.</p>
<p>We need to think through this. I think that it does make sense for the context in this case to contain multiple medication prescriptions.</p>
