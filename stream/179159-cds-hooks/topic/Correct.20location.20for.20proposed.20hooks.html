<p>When looking for the wiki to propose new hooks, I found the following:<br>
1. <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Proposed-Hooks" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Proposed-Hooks">https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Proposed-Hooks</a><br>
2. <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki">https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki</a> (the little "Proposed Hooks" edit window that shows a small list of hooks that doesn't correspond to the previous link)<br>
3. <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/cds-hooks/wiki/Proposed-Activities" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/cds-hooks/wiki/Proposed-Activities">https://github.com/cds-hooks/cds-hooks/wiki/Proposed-Activities</a> (it's archived, but there's nothing that indicates it's not authoritative or where the authoritative list is - it's also the first list I found when Googling)<br>
4. <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/hooks/wiki" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/hooks/wiki">https://github.com/cds-hooks/hooks/wiki</a> (which says it's the repository for hooks, but is empty)</p>
<p>So which of these is "the" place to register proposed hooks?  And can we get rid of the others (or at least include an indication that they're retired and point to the correct place)?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/cds-hooks" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/cds-hooks">cds-hooks/cds-hooks</a> repository is the very first repository we were using but we moved away from it several years ago (which is why the repository is archived). If you look at the README in the repository, you'll see that note. Other than updating every single page to note this, I'm not sure what more we can do.</p>

<p>I hear your feedback though on this. We're actively working on shoring this all up now. See <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues/195" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues/195">#195</a> :-)</p>

<p>Lloyd, I'm actively working on defining and documenting the process for proposing/creating new hooks here: <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues/195" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues/195">https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues/195</a></p>

<p>Can I wipe the little summary page on #2 that isn't actually a summary - or replace it with something that says "Quick Links" and includes a link to the actual proposed hooks page?  Is the intention that we're going to migrate from #1 to #4?  If not, can we delete #4?  (Understand the issue with #3.  If we make the correct link prominent enough elsewhere, it might not be a problem.)</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/hooks/wiki" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/hooks/wiki">https://github.com/cds-hooks/hooks/wiki</a> was the working proposal for where proposed hooks would live</p>

<p>So yes, the intention was to migrate from <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Proposed-Hooks" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Proposed-Hooks">https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Proposed-Hooks</a> to <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/hooks/wiki" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/hooks/wiki">https://github.com/cds-hooks/hooks/wiki</a>. Though, I don't think we migrate that content over -- if people want to propose those hooks still, once we work out this process they can do so</p>

<p>If we'll ask people to formally submit proposals, then we should update the Proposed-Hooks page to indicate that it's deprecated once it's deprecated - and wipe it after sufficient time has passed for people to migrate what they want to wipe.</p>

<p>Given that the process is a little in flux, what's my best path for DaVinci hook proposals which I'd like to get up this week?  Should I just define them in the IG and wait to submit?  Put them on the Proposed-Hooks page for now?  Act as guinea pig for the proposed new process?  Some combination of the above? :)</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> - the best case scenario (for CDS Hooks) is that you're the guinea pig for the proposed new process. I'd love your feedback. This is also probably the most expensive choice in terms of your time, though.</p>

<p>Hey Lloyd, not really, but that shouldn't stop you. <br>
I just jiggered around the hook maturity model in <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues/195" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues/195">#195</a>, but it's still a discussion or two (or three)  from being incorporated into the spec.</p>
<p>The spirit of the process is that you should submit a PR for a new page, following the <a href="https://cds-hooks.org/hooks/#hook-definition-format" target="_blank" title="https://cds-hooks.org/hooks/#hook-definition-format">hook definition format</a> and that PR should survive as the interim definition of the hook until maturity.</p>
