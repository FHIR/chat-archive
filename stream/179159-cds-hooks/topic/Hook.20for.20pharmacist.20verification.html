<p>I was looking at the hooks that currently exist, and didn't see one that would be appropriate for CDS that is shown to a pharmacist who is verifying a medication order.  The information I'd expect to be sent as context is similar to what is sent for the order-sign hook, except that instead of draft-orders, it would be the information for the order being verified.  Does it make sense to use the order-sign hook for this workflow?<br>
Thank you!</p>

Note that the order being verified is an order that has already been signed.</p>

<p>I think order-sign's structure  could be used to try out some use-cases, but correct there would be some tweaks to the hook context.  Since they aren't draft orders, the CDS Service won't necessarily have all of the same types of guidance and a different hook would communicate that semantic difference in the workflow.  I'm curious what kinds of decision guidance any services in question would be communicating (to help paint the picture).</p>

<p>I feel like the guidance would be roughly the same, just presented to a different user (the pharmacist)</p>
<p>All the decision factors written somewhat humorously here could be possibilities</p>
