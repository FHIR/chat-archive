<p>Hi all,<br>
We are creating plandefinition which have libraries. Suppose we have a Plan definition called CMS 146 which includes some medications. For example a patient has a chronic opioid medication and he is suffering from pharyngitis disease. If we have many number of medications with many plandefinitions. How we know which medication is for which disease? which cds hooks is used to trigger this?</p>

<p>Determining what decision support is evaluated at a hook is an integration decision. PlanDefinitions can help in that determination by surfacing what data is involved in the decision support, but ultimately it's a question of whether that decision support is applicable at that point in the workflow, and CDS Hooks doesn't prescribe that, it's a content question.</p>
