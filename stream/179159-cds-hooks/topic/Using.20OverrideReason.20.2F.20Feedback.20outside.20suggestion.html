<p>Current spec <a href="https://cds-hooks.org/specification/current/#overridereason" title="https://cds-hooks.org/specification/current/#overridereason">https://cds-hooks.org/specification/current/#overridereason</a> and PR <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/519" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/519">https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/519</a> are geared towards using OverrideReason with suggestions. Our patient-view hooks service responds with applicable pathways (as app link cards) for users to interact with based on the patient context. The use case we wanted to try out is as a CDS service provider, present bunch of app link cards (with out suggestions - example below) and let user override the same if they think that the app link card is not applicable</p>

<p>Override reasons are at the card level and feedback is per card.uuid, so I think this is a valid use</p>

<p>Good Point. We were more focused on the flow when provider did not agree with the CDS Service's recommendation to launch the app link (Card Overridden action). But Provider/EHR user can possibly take three different actions when an app link card is presented</p>
<ul>
<li>Card Ignored - Nothing sent to /feedback end point</li>
<li>Card Overriden - User pick one of the override reason. Overriden feedback sent to /feedback endpoint (based on the override reason picked by the user)</li>
<li>Card Accepted by virtue of launching the SMART app link - We weren't expecting anything sent back to /feedback endpoint. Technically a CDS Service provider can tie up an particular SMART launch to a card using appContext if needed or potentially CDS client can also send Card Accepted feedback to /feedback end point</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191644">@Raj M</span> Thanks for outlining the use case. Sounds like a valid use. I suppose based on receiving the feedback with the override reasons the CDS Service would not resend those corresponding cards on subsequent patient-view CDS Service Requests for that patient?</p>

<p>Yes <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192613">@Chuck Feltner</span>  that is the intent in longer run. Shorter term goal is learning the effectiveness of our Hooks service</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191644">@Raj M</span> , any suggestions for clarifying that it is okay to supply overrideReasons on a card without suggestions, in the spec?</p>



<a name="196692906"></a>
<h4><a href="https://chat.fhir.org#narrow/stream/179159-cds%20hooks/topic/Using%20OverrideReason%20/%20Feedback%20outside%20suggestion/near/196692906" class="zl"><img src="https://fhir.github.io/chat-archive/assets/img/zulip.svg" alt="view this post on Zulip" style="width:20px;height:20px;"></a> Raj M <a href="https://fhir.github.io/chat-archive/stream/179159-cds-hooks/topic/Using.20OverrideReason.20.2F.20Feedback.20outside.20suggestion.html#196692906">(May 06 2020 at 20:31)</a>:</h4>
<p>Sure <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191864">@Isaac Vetter</span>.  I am thinking it will be good to clarify 'card' vs 'suggestion in a card'.  </p>
<p>In the current.md (master) </p>
<ul>
<li><code>overrideReasons</code> | OPTIONAL | <em>array</em> of <strong>OverrideReason</strong> | Override reasons can be selected by the end user when overriding a card <del>without taking the suggested recommendations</del> <strong><em>or suggestion in a card</em></strong>. The CDS service MAY return a list of override reasons to the CDS client. The CDS client SHOULD present these reasons to the clinician when they dismiss a card. A CDS client MAY augment the override reasons presented to the user with its own reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the pr#519</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once a CDS Hooks service responds to a hook by returning an info or suggestion card, the service has no further interaction with the CDS client. The acceptance or rejection of a <del>suggestion</del> <strong><em>card or suggestion in a card</em></strong> is valuable information to enable a service to improve its behavior towards the goal of the end-user having a positive and meaningful experience with the CDS. A feedback endpoint enables suggestion tracking &amp; analytics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typically, an end user may only accept <strong><em>a suggestion in a card</em></strong>, or override a card once; however, a card once ignored could later be acted upon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CDS client can inform the service when one or more suggestions <strong><em>in a card</em></strong> were accepted by POSTing a simple json object. The CDS client authenticates to the CDS service as described in <a href="#trusting-cds-clients" title="#trusting-cds-clients">Trusting CDS Clients</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A CDS client may enable the end user to override guidance without providing an explicit reason for doing so. The CDS client can inform the service when a <del>suggestion</del> <strong><em>card</em></strong> was dismissed by specifying an outcome of <code>overridden</code> without providing an <code>overrideReason</code>. This may occur, for example, when the end user viewed the card and dismissed it without providing a reason why.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Raj, Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>A CDS client can inform the service when a <del>suggestion</del> <strong>card</strong> was rejected by POSTing an outcome of <code>overridden</code> along with an <code>overrideReason</code> to the service's feedback endpoint. The CDS Client may enable the clinician to supplement the <code>overrideReason</code> with a free text comment, supplied to the CDS Service in <code>overrideReason.userComment</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I changed your above, like so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once a CDS Hooks service responds to a hook by returning an info or suggestion card, the service has no further interaction with the CDS client. The acceptance <strong>of a suggestion</strong> or rejection of a card <del>or suggestion</del> is valuable information to enable a service to improve its behavior towards the goal of the end-user having a positive and meaningful experience with the CDS. A feedback endpoint enables suggestion tracking &amp; analytics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Effectively, a suggestion isn't overridden -- only a card can be overidden. A card isn't accepted, only one or more suggestions can be accepted. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>This is pretty much what the PR already said, e.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon receiving a card, a user may accept its sugestions, ignore it entirely, or dismiss it with or without an override reason. Note that while one or more suggestions can be accepted, an entire card is either ignored or overridden.</p>
