<blockquote>
<p>What do you see as the main advantage to using CDS Hooks?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This depends on what your alternative is. I initially designed CDS Hooks with two advantages in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advantage over using SMART Apps alone for CDS. When it comes to running a SMART app, clincians can connect all kind of CDS tools to the EHR and run them at-will. For example, you might run a bilirubin management app to guide you towards apporpriate therapy for a neonate. The main challenge becomes the cognitive burden for a clinician: there are too many apps, each doing a small job; how do you know which app to run in any given circumstance? And for apps that are <em>critically useful</em> but only <em>rarely</em>, this is an especially hard problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advantage over vendor-specific deep integration of CDS. Here, it comes down to a marketplace argument: as a service developer, it's very hard to keep up to date with a wide surface area of different EHR vendor APIs. Targeting a standard means you can focus on integrating with a consistent set of APIs, and really polishing the user experience around it. There are trade-offs here (e.g., the standard API is often going to lag behind specific vendor APIs in raw capabilities), but as the community grows, it drives consistency in the user experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I think this first advantage you mentioned is so important. Currently working as a bedside nurse myself, I know clinicians can easily get overwhelmed with many different tasks and may not think to use a specific app that could be beneficial to them. I see great promise with CDS Hooks running these important apps automatically!</p>

<p>From my perspective as an EHR developer, I see the advantage to CDS Hooks as the reverse side of Josh's second bullet -- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>as a service developer, it's very hard to keep up to date with a wide surface area of different EHR vendor APIs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a CDS client developer, it's hard to educate and provide an ecosystem of testing tools and libraries that best enable a CDS service developer to use my own API. By using a standard, integration gets faster and cheaper for everyone.</p>

<p>I actually disagree with Josh's point about consistent "UI". I believe that there's currently little commonality of the display of CDS Hooks cards across widely deployed EHRs.</p>

<p>Lastly, CDS Hooks' modern security architecture and integration with FHIR are distinct advantages over previous remote CDS standards. Additionally, the <code>prefetch</code> mechanism and the CDS service's streamlined ability to query standard, RESTful FHIR APIs are novel.</p>
