<p>I wanted to capture the details of our discussion this morning (cc <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193265">@Matt Varghese</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191355">@Kevin Shekleton</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196616">@Matt Simko</span>) around restricting the triggering of CDS service calls based on parameters.  </p>
<p>Our goal is to allow the CDS service to be called for a specific hook (say <code>order-sign</code>) for a subset of cases (ex. imaging orders vs all orders). Currently, this is either not possible or requires proprietary EMR configuration. </p>
<p>From a CDS service perspective, we prefer not to have to use EMR specific configuration. Instead, we'd like a standard mechanism where, as part of the hook itself, we can specify when we want to be called.</p>
<p>As far as the mechanism itself, the options range from a CQL based specification to a simple list of relevant resources (ex. Imaging Appropriateness service can specify list of imaging orders as part of <code>order-sign</code> hook). My personal preference is to keep it as simple as possible, in order to encourage EMRs to support it. So, I'd be happy with just a list of orders associated with a hook.</p>

<p>Something that we (M*Modal) have been investigating is the use of FHIRPath in order to create this kind of call restricting/filtering. This might be an interesting option as STU3 is more widely adopted.</p>
