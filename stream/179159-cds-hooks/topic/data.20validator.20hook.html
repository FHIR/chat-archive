<p>Has there been any interest in a hook that just validates the data? Where this validation is to a set of local profiles or such. I am thinking things like data entry use-cases to validate the data is not a fat-finger oops. Patient weighs -10 lbs.</p>

<p>(yes, i know the example I gave is just a profile validation... but I am thinking of validation as a service, where that service could be more complex than a profile might expose -- and might be more simply implemented than using the FHIR validation service)</p>

<p>How would that manifest to the end user?  Keep in mind that they're going to be looking at a screen and have no idea what a profile is - or what their data is called in FHIR.  There's also no ability in CDS Hooks right now to tie a message to a data element in a resource (or any expected capability for a service to propagate such a link back to an element in the UI).</p>

<p>I was thinking maybe John meant in cases where CDS hooks are used as part of our own developer tooling?</p>

<p>I was merely expecting that the response to the hook would indicate good vs bad; and if bad there would be a reasonable user consumable message. I was not expecting an implementation existed. I was looking for if the hook was "defined", as I don't see one like this in the list of defined hook types.</p>
