<p>I'm currently looking at the DetectedIssue Resource and happened to notice that - other than OperationOutcome - this resource can only point at the implicated resource, but not at the specific field that caused the conflict.<br>
Are there any plans to add a FHIRPath expression to the resource to be able to be more specific about the  source of the problem?</p>

<p>Not that I'm aware of, but I think that's a good idea. You could have a path pointing to the dosage quantity, for example. An extension on the implicited element would be a good first step.</p>

<p>I think this is probably extension space.  Most systems that support identifying drug-drug, drug-allergy or similar issues wouldn't be able to do more than point to the records</p>
