<p>Based on our discussions around <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues/377">Issue#377</a>, I've put together a pull request that (I think) meets the technical need in as simple a manner as possible.  It's <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/612">PR#612</a>.</p>

<p>It build on our previous discussion about allowing 'simple' FHIRPath in search prefetch tokens, but adds one additional piece - the ability to convert relative references to simple ids.  There's already a custom way of doing that for userId (you can use userPatientId, userPractitionerId, etc.), but this is a one-off and doesn't address the issue of doing it for other parameters (the new order-dispatch proposal has two cases where there's a relativeReference that could be a variety of resources and there may need to be a search with an include on that resource.  It's also needed to solve the "MedicationReference.medication" issue.</p>
<p>Take a read, provide feedback, and hopefully we can discuss on an upcoming CDS Hooks call.</p>

<p>Due to personal reasons I cannot join this weeks CDS telco. If possible can we move the CDS-hooks ballot-reconciliation to the week of the 16th of  February?</p>
