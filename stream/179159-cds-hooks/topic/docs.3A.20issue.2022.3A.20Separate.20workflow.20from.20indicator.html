<blockquote>
<p>Currently the CDS-Hooks specification uses the field ‘indicator’ in a card to describe two different concepts: the urgency/importance of the card, and how the workflow within the EMR should process the card. While these two concepts are somewhat similar and may appear to overlap, they are distinct. The urgency/importance indicates to the EMR how to display the card to the end-user. The workflow processing indicates if the user can dismiss/ignore the card, must explicitly accept a suggestion or provide a reason for not accepting a suggestion, or has no choice but to accept a suggestion.</p>
<p>We would like to suggest modifying Card.indicator to remove ‘hard-stop’ as it explicitly is indicating a workflow processing approach, and add Card.workflowImpact required field with values of ‘no-stop’, ‘soft-stop’, ‘medium-stop’, and ‘hard-stop’:<br>
* <strong>No stop</strong> - Workflow should not be impacted. This is really for completeness as a card which has no clinical recommendations should not impact the workflow at all.<br>
* <strong>Soft stop</strong> - The user can continue the workflow without providing any reason or accepting a suggestion.<br>
* <strong>Medium stop</strong> - The user must provide a reason for not accepting a suggestion before proceeding in the workflow. <br>
* <strong>Hard stop</strong> - The user must accept a suggestion to proceed in the workflow.</p>
<p>Note that these workflowImpact values tell the EMR how the CDS service believes the EMR should behave. It is up to the EMR to determine how that impacts the user's actual workflow. In other words, it is a suggestion, not a demand.</p>
