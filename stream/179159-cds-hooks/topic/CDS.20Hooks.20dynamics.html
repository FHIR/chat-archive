<p>In various discussions during the Connecthaton and over the last weeks a noticed a large difference in the approach to the CDS Hooks Card dynamics.</p>
<p>Some of the variations observed include:<br>
(1) All hooks, except order-select are requested once. Order-select CDS services are recalled when the order changes. The new cards will replace the existing ones.<br>
(2) CDS services are ordered in a list. The first server is called and the cards are shown. When the user closes this card, the next CDS Server will be called <br>
(3) All CDS Services are updated when the context changes. </p>
<p>Card behavior<br>
(1) All cards remain in place, additional CDS calls will add new cards to the list.<br>
(2) Cards are only removed when this is explicitly done by the end-user<br>
(3) Cards are removed when a suggestion is followed.</p>
<p>The specification does not state what the expected behavior is. What is the expected behavior?</p>
