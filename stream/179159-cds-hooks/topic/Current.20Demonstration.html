<p>I'm looking for a current demonstration of a CDS Hooks implementation for either the Patient View or Order Select hook.  Is there someone  who would be willing to demonstrate current capabilities? MaxMD is interested in participating in Connectathon Tracks focused on CDS Hooks but we would like to see some examples of information, suggestion, and app link cards being received and processed by recipient systems.  Can someone point me to implementers who are capable to offer demonstrations?</p>
