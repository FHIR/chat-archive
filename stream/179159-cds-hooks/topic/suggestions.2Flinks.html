<p>We are currently implementing a CDS Hook service suggesting studies for cancer patients. This includes links to clinicaltrails.<br>
I couldn't find a defined way to include links into suggestions, or tie a link to a suggestion.<br>
Is there a best practice on how to do this?</p>

<p>What do you actually want the clinician to see?  It seems like text with a hyperlink to a website is likely to be more useful than a resource reference, as I'm not sure what an EHR would do with a resource reference right now.  (I'm not aware of many/any EHRs that have support for ResearchStudy right now...)</p>

<p>We were thinking about actions creating the patients study enrolment directly, but also providing links to clinical trails for these studies</p>

<p>Currently we are thinking about adding a link element to the suggestion as well. What do other CDS people think about this? Can this be added to the CDS Hook Spec?</p>

<p>If the action creates the patient study enrollment , what FHIR resource is that suggesting be created?  Is the clinical trials link a website?  Why does this need to be on the suggestion? What is the reason for not using card.links?</p>

<p>The action would create a ResearchSubject. Yes clinical trials is a website/DB: <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</a></p>

<p>It does need to be on the suggestion, as the CDS Service queries available studies and proposes the best fitting one(s) via suggestions.</p>

<p>Inside the suggestion there should be a possibility to include a linkt to more details of the study</p>

<p>I'm still not understanding why that wouldn't just come back on the card.  The card is  focused on clinical trials.  The suggestion is FHIR-focused on creating a resource, and the link is supplemental content.  There's nothing for the EHR to programmatically do with the link, right?</p>

<p>right.<br>
So you are proposing putting the link into the label of the suggestion then? Could work, but you'd end up with a link inline in a string label. <br>
Like it is done with the links on the card level, a link per suggestion would be a nice feature.<br>
This link is only meant for human consumption to get background on the suggested action.</p>

<p>Is this a CDS Hooks question? Or is this a FHIR question? <br>
To propose that a patient be enrolled in a study is an action (which will be in a suggestion in CDS Hooks). That action will include a FHIR resource, which is the enrollment of the patient on the study. Shouldn't that FHIR resource be pointing therefore to the study? So isn't this a FHIR resource question?</p>
