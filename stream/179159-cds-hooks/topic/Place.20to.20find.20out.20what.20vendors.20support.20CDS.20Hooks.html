<p>Is there a place to find out what vendors support CDS Hooks and in what versions of their software? We're preparing some CDS Hook services and it would be useful to be able to overlay which of our customers could benefit from CDS Hooks based on the EMRs their providers are already using, or know what version of the EMR they'd have to upgrade to in order to get that benefit.</p>

<p>Best source for integration lists are generally the EHR vendors themselves. Most have advanced FHIR capabilities documented behind a paywall or app program of some sort.</p>

<p>Offhand, I think Cerner and Epic have CDS support of some kind, although I'm not sure whether Epic is pure CDS Hooks or something more proprietary.</p>

<p>My understanding is Epic's CDS Hooks is a standard implementation with support for the patient-view hook as of the August 2018 release.</p>
