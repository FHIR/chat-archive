<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have implemented a new cds service which provides "lipid management" guidelines based on the "NICE guideline CD181:Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification, Chapter 1.3.20-1.3.51". It provides the suggested 'goals' and 'activities' that needs to be added to the care plan of a patient, given his medical summary in the prefetch object. Demo service is available at <a href="http://app.srdc.com.tr/cds-demo" target="_blank" title="http://app.srdc.com.tr/cds-demo">http://app.srdc.com.tr/cds-demo</a>.</p>
<p>The sample CDS-Hooks service is written in NodeJS. The code is available at: <a href="https://github.com/srdc/cds-hooks-example-lipid/" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/srdc/cds-hooks-example-lipid/">https://github.com/srdc/cds-hooks-example-lipid/</a></p>
<p>As explained in the Readme, sample inputs to test the service are available under public/test/sample-inputs.</p>
<p>Detailed description of the pre-fetch configuration of each sample input is also available at public/test/sample-inputs/Sample-CDS-Service.xlsx  along with the flowcharts annotated with test-cases.</p>
