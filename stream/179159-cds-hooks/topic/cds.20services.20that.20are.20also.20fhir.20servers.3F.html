<p>What are the use cases for having a single "FHIR server" that can respond to CDS hooks and <strong>also</strong> expose  the FHIR API (with CRUD on clinical/infrastructure resources)? I understand that all other things being equal <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> would build both kinds of functionality into his test server. But what is the real use case? What do we stand to gain by having both kinds of functionality co-located in a single server?</p>

<p>Of course. But since it's already doing lots of FHIR content, the advantages of using the FHIR definitional layer are obvious. As are the long term advantages for when more formal standardisation is appropriate</p>

<p>And the way we're using the  FHIR operations framework is a bit cumbersome in that regard. Tacking an operation onto a custom resource would help (/CdsService/med-pricing/$invoke), or adding a path parameter to operations (/$cds-service/med-pricing), to make different services easy to route/scale by path. </p>

<p>Well, I think that the custom resource pathway is the best so far identified. You might want to not miss fmg calls for the next few weeks then. Difficult discussion about custom resources there yesterday </p>

<p>Yes, good point! (Yesterday was AMIA in SF.) </p>

<p>My opinion and views on this are that mature/experienced organizations will likely not conflate a FHIR server and CDS service into a single deployment. I do not think this will be common deplyoment/management scenario so while I certainly wouldn't want to preclude someone from going down this path, I wouldn't want this to be primary driver/influencer behind design decisions.</p>
<p>By mature/experienced organization, I'm referring to:<br>
- Large organizations (eg, enterprise)<br>
- Teams/companies who experienced with building/deploying/managing services (eg, they likely already have services deployed today)</p>
<p>With many organizations embracing the architectural pattern of microservices (<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html" target="_blank" title="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html</a>), separating the FHIR server and the CDS service would be a very natural course of action for them. Microservices are certainly buzzy right now (so I don't use the term lightly), but a microservice design has very real benefits.</p>

<p>I also think that most CDS services will not be from the same company as the fhir service.</p>

<p>Just for clarity in my case was referring to that there are likely 3 components taking place, the FHIR data server, a user interface application (cds consumer) and CDS services (that are hooked together)<br>
As is in the cds demo.<br>
I think this will be quite normal that all 3 can and will come from different vendors/systems.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191367">@Brian Postlethwaite</span>!  And after discussing with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191355">@Kevin Shekleton</span> I'm convinced that this special case (a FHIR server that also exposes CDS Hooks) is unduly influencing our design thinking. </p>
<p>Of course some servers may want to  (e.g. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>'s server) but it's probably unusual outside the  FHIR echo chamber.</p>
