<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191355">@Kevin Shekleton</span> and others. You recently posted on GitHub that decisions and the redirect field will be excluded from release 1.0 (<a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/116" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/116">https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/116</a>). The official documentation now has a "1.0" sub-section, which still references decisions and redirect. (e.g. <a href="http://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/#redirect" target="_blank" title="http://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/#redirect">http://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/#redirect</a>) <br>
Could you clarify what the guidance is around that? The redirect seems to be required in order for the CDS service to notify the EHR that the interaction is done and the EHR can ask for the results.</p>

<p>Hi Wolfgang. <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/116" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/116">PR #116</a> had not yet been merged to master which is why you still saw <code>decisions</code> &amp; <code>redirect</code> still on <a href="http://cds-hooks.org" target="_blank" title="http://cds-hooks.org">cds-hooks.org</a>. I just merged PR 116 into master so now <a href="http://cds-hooks.org" target="_blank" title="http://cds-hooks.org">cds-hooks.org</a> reflects the removal of both <code>decisions</code> and <code>redirect</code>.</p>

<p><code>redirect</code> was used for Decisions but with the limited implementer feedback we had received, there were proposals to change the strategy from URI redirects to Javascript postMessages (see <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/26" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/26">PR #26</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/27" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/27">PR #27</a>). The consensus of the community was that we will focus on Decisions post 1.0 to gain additional implementer feedback and come up with a workable solution for the wide variety of EHRs that exist (both web based EHRs as well as native desktop EHRs).</p>

<p>With CDS Hooks today, CDS Services can return a card with a link to a SMART app. For the implementations I have seen, these SMART apps are opened embedded in the EHR.</p>

<p>We are currently using redirect and decisions, however in a non-compliant way (the create/delete with arrays of IDs is currently not workable for us). </p>
<p>In 1.0, is it up to the EHR and the 3rd party to agree on how the 3rd party communicates that the user is done with the interactions in the 3rd party app? And that a result is available? </p>
<p>Would you still expect the 3rd party app to create data via the EHR's FHIR Api?</p>

<p>CDS Services &amp; SMART apps can certainly still create/write data back to the EHR. With CDS Services, they can do that via Suggestions. With SMART apps, they can use the FHIR API. For instance, Cerner's FHIR server supports several different writes today with some of the FHIR resources (see <a href="http://fhir.cerner.com" target="_blank" title="http://fhir.cerner.com">http://fhir.cerner.com</a> for more details)</p>

<p>If you need to communicate something outside of the CDS Hook 1.0 spec, you would need to do it outside of our current API. We do an an issue to determine a strategy for extensions (<a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues/76" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues/76">#76</a>) that will be in 1.0 and can be used in your use case</p>
