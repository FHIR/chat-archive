<p>Hi there. I am working with Bryn Rhodes on a health platform that engages a CDS service using CDS Hooks. I don't have a specific use cases necessarily. I am wondering if there is a pre-defined taxonomy of suggestion card types that could be used for downstream processing to determine how a suggestion should be handled? I can imagine that some suggestions are urgent and should be routed to a provider or patient through a real-time messaging system. Other suggestion cards might be stored and only shown when someone actively logs into the system. Who receives the suggestion card, when they receive it and through which communication channel they receive it could all be based on the suggestion card type. Thanks!</p>

<p>this is a confusing question because the assumption is that there's a user seeing the cards immediately and acting on them</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193282">@Bo Dagnall</span>. Currently, our use case within CDS Hooks has been focused on an interactive/synchronous hook between a user in the EHR and the CDS Service. In other words, when the CDS Service returns cards the expectation is that the EHR is rendering them and displaying them to the current user.</p>
<p>The use case you're describing sounds like an asynchronous hook where there isn't necessarily a user in context. This is a use case we're interested in exploring but we haven't put much thought into it just yet. :/</p>

<p>Thanks Kevin. You are right that we are targeting an asynchronous use case. We are taking a platform approach to health interoperability and interacting with EMRs and other systems as either data consumers or data producers. As such, it is not obvious to our platform what action should be taken for different types of suggestion cards. If you have thoughts on this, perhaps we can set up a time to chat. Thanks</p>

<p>I will definitely look at that. CDS Hooks is only par of the work we are doing, so active participation from us may depend on how many people I am able to send to the Connectathon. Thanks for the offer though.</p>

<p>Revisiting this thread after a long gap..... we are making progress implementing our CDS hooks interface to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span> CDS Service. As stated above, our product is middleware that offers a layer of abstraction between the clinical data sources (e.g., EMR backends) and the end-user interface (EMR frontends or SMART on FHIR apps). As such, we do not have a session with the end user of the system that is querying us for data and therefore have no one to return a CDS suggestion card to. In the short-term, we have a basic data viewer useful for visualizing the data we provide that can be used to at least see CDS alerts, notifications, suggestions, etc. However, the longer term answer needs to be workflow aware. We need to think about a taxonomy of CDS suggestion types that we can use to determine how and who to route suggestions to asynchronously. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194864">@Julie Scherer</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span> and I discussed this at HL7 this week and have some initial thoughts on how to do this using some workflow models that Julie has. However, this seems like an area that the standards group should weigh in on.</p>

<p>Really? I don't think we should limit CDS Hooks to synchronous connections. This async pattern seems to me like a logical extension of the current state. If I am wrong, what do you suggest as an alternative?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>IMO: the purpose shouldn't be limited to just UI integration. CDS-as-a-Service accessed through CDS Hooks has broader applicability and CDS in general isn't always synchronous. In a system-of-systems architecture, we have to allow for different pieces of the ecosystem to gain access to core capabilities like CDS within the operating model and workflow they support.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193282">@Bo Dagnall</span> - currently with CDS Hooks, our focus is squarely on synchronous, UI based CDS to a user. We have discussed asynchronous event based CDS as a future focus but have not yet determined when we'll tackle that.</p>

<p>There is definitely community interest in this use case (I've heard it from lots of folks). Based on this, I'm confident we'll get consensus to explore this use case in the spec.
