<p>looking through the hooks spec, I don't see any way for a hook client to inform the hook service when a user applies a suggestion.  Is this something that has been discussed?  I would see great value in some enumeration of suggestion responses (applied, acknowledged, hidden, rejected) and a webhook or other means for the client to inform the provider of the disposition of their suggestions.</p>

<p>There was an analytics endpoint which was removed (<a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/382" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/382">https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/382</a>) in the May 2018 ballot because I heard there weren't CDS services actually making use of that endpoint to do anything.  If you see validity in adding it (or similar) back, you could log a GitHub issue to start that conversation</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191358">@Dennis Patterson</span> .    I'll look into it.  We certainly have some very strong use cases.</p>

<p>When some action is taken on suggestion, how to notify CDS service which one? as analytics endpoint has been removed.</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="213764">@Anshu Nigam</span> , there is not currently an alternative method to notify the CDS service of the results of its guidance. In practice, my understanding is that this is typically done periodically, through some type of reporting instead of in realtime. We are hoping to pick up this feature and refine it and gain some implementation experience as part of a future release of CDS Hooks.</p>
