<p>Does the CDS community have assumptions around how to document an order check override? Is that an AuditEvent, or is there some other mechanism out there?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191985">@Jay Lyle</span> , the 1.1 feature considerations list has "overrides" as one of the issues we'd like to provide support for. In addition, there is a proposal for <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Acknowledgement-reasons-for-1.1" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Acknowledgement-reasons-for-1.1">acknowledgement reasons</a> that we've been looking at. How the actual override gets persisted in the CDS Client and/or Service is something that would be up to the implementations, but it would be great to get some ideas about how to represent those. Can you provide a little more detail about your use case for an "order check override"?</p>

<p>Thanks Bryn; as we talked about, most of the use case is around capturing the guidance provided in the instance (what, when, to whom, criticality), but we also want to capture, in the event of an override, the override reason text.</p>
