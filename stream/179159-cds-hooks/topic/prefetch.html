<p>Anyone using Prefetch with generated Swagger API code? One problem I see is we have prefetch on the cdsService as well as CDSRequest. The cdsService defines it as String-&gt;String for a call template, the response is a String -&gt; complex object map but should typically be a Fhir resource of some kind of a Bundle which is a Resource. Didn't know if anyone has used / worked around those issues or not.</p>

<p>David, I think you're first to try out generting models from our Swagger API. I thought someone else had but was mistaken. Let me know what else you run into</p>

<p>When filling in the prefetch values before calling the cds-hooks service, sometimes the response can be multiple resources - so I assume the value against the key will then be an array of entries. That means that sometimes the value will be an array, and sometimes it will not doesn't it? Would it not be better to always be an array to make the service simpler?</p>

<p>OK cancel the question - I see that where there is more than one response then the value is a Bundle...</p>
