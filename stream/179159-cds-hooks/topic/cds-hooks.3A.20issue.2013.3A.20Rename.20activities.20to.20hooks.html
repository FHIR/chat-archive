<p>From #10:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case where a single $cds-hook endpoint serves multiple different activities (medication-prescribe and patient-view, for example -- btw, see how using the word "hooks" there would have been akward?), I see the value in having a list of hooks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would have worded that something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case where a single $cds-hook endpoint offers multiple services across several hooks...</p>

<p>Mmm. Maybe the operation shouldn't be called <code>cds-hook</code> though. I mean, is the "hook" something the EHR does, or something the CDS Service exposes, or both? Both feels unsatisfying here, like we need more/better/clearer terms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EHRs offer <strong>hooks</strong> for areas or activities within the EHR in which a CDS Service can *hook* into.</p>
<p>CDS Providers offers <strong>services</strong> which are invoked by the EHR at the desired hook.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So,<br>
- CDS Providers, not CDS Services. This is because it's awkward to say "CDS Services offers services..."<br>
- Hooks, not activities (see above). Activities imply user action and certainly today our hooks are invoked as a result of explicit user action. However, I'm certain we'll see hooks in the future which are purely passive (eg, the EHR offers a hook into an *area* of the application that is always visible; like a notification bar / system tray)</p>
<p>This terminology would have the following ramifications:</p>
<p>- POST /$cds-service for invoking a service in the CDS Provider<br>
- GET /$cds-service-metadata to get the metadata for all services offered by the CDS Provider</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I find this very clear, and I like the notion that hooks are exposed by the EHR, and services are exposed by the CDS Provider. That solves a naming problem that's been bugging me for a while. </p>
<p>Slight tweaks to the overview (see if you are okay with "workflow" in this sense - I do agree with your point about  areas of the screen, but it's hard to express concisely):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EHRs offer "hooks" into specific points in the workflow where external CDS Providers can be consulted </p>
<p>CDS Providers offer services that respond when an EHR triggers a  hook</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I'm still on the fence about "trigger".) </p>
