<p>Hello, I'm at the Cleveland Medical Hackathon and my group is trying to come up with a solution for identifying patients with Parkinson's disease who otherwise would not know to seek a certain treatment. One of the EPIC mentors directed us to CDS Hooks as a way to flag up Parkinson's patients from the EHR who could benefit from the treatment. He suggested we join this group for guidance. We're very new but could anyone advise on how to use CDS Hooks to flag Parkinson's patients?</p>

<p>If you wanted to use the <code>prefetch</code> functionality of CDS Hooks, you could try a Conditions lookup where you search for any SNOMED code associated with Parkinson's. See <a href="https://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/#prefetch-template" target="_blank" title="https://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/#prefetch-template">https://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/#prefetch-template</a> for docs/examples; if you look at the first example with the "a1c" field, that's probably the closest to showing the formatting you'd need to use (though you'd be looking for Condition resources, not Observations).</p>

<p>CDS Hooks allows you to tie into an EHR's workflow - so the first question is "at what point in clinical decision-making do you want to identify that the patient has (or might have) Parkonson's?"  When the patient record is first displayed?  When you're ordering tests?  When you're ordering medications?  When you're doing discharge planning?</p>
