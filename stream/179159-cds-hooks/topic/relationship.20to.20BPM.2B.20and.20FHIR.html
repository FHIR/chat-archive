<p>I have been doing some investigation into the state of the art in CDS and have discovered the BPM+ spec.  My question is around how BPM+ ,FHIR, and CDS Hooks work together to make CDS truly interoperable.  Is CDS Hooks the launcher?  Can it call a BPM+ enabled CDS endpoint like <a href="https://service/execute-clinical-pathway-x">https://service/execute-clinical-pathway-x</a> with a FHIR Bundle in the HTTP Body containing the structured clinical data and get a result?  Would the result be a DiagnosticReport?</p>

<p>CDS Hooks is an integration specification that is intentionally silent about what's on the other side. It would certainly be possible to call to a CDS Hooks service that implemented it's behavior by following the BPM+ spec, it would just need to faithfully implement the server-side of the CDS Hooks specification. What resources are returned depends on the use case. CDS Hooks defines structures for the request and response, with the specific proposals often being represented using FHIR Request resources. For a flavor of the kinds of things that are possible, here's a simple example of building up a CDS Service using the FHIR Clinical Reasoning module to describe the behavior of the service: <a href="https://github.com/cqframework/content-ig-walkthrough">https://github.com/cqframework/content-ig-walkthrough</a></p>
