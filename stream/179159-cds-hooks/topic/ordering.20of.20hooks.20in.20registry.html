<p>One other question related to the list of hooks in the menu.  What order should they be in?  Alphabetical?  Most mature to least mature?  Right now we're not doing either of those things.  It's not a huge problem yet, but it's slightly confusing and it'll get worse over time. I'm happy to update the order once there's agreement as to what it should be...</p>
