<p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>I would like to understand suggestion card response for CDS response object.<br>
We definitely require status kind of field as defined by HL7 specification i.e. <a href="https://www.hl7.org/FHIR/valueset-guidance-response-status.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/FHIR/valueset-guidance-response-status.html">https://www.hl7.org/FHIR/valueset-guidance-response-status.html</a></p>
<p>This gives more information to the cosnumer of this service.</p>
<p>Is there any way we can tell the service user to call other hook if any response returned by the card is not appropriate. We are looking the solution for this kind of scenario in our business.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197188">@Jitendra Kumar Sahu</span> , I'm not sure I understand what you're asking. The guidance response statuses were intended to support a conversational-style where the service could indicate that it required more information, but not necessarily that it could instruct the client to call a different hook. Can you describe a bit more about your use case?</p>
