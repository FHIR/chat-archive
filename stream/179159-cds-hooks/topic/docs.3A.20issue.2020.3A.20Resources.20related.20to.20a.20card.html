<blockquote>
<p>Currently, the CDS-hooks specification does not provide a mechanism associating the CDS card to the order(s), or other resources, that it is in response to. For example, if a CDS information card came back from a CDS service indicating that a prescription dosage was too high given the patient’s age, it would be beneficial for the EHR to know the particular order the information card was referring to so that it might apply special formatting on the order (or other actions) when the user interacts with the card.</p>
<p>Ideally the card should have an additional <strong>relatedResources</strong> field which can contain this set of resources. These resources would generally be a subset of resources provided in the context.</p>
