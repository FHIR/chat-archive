<p>HSPC is putting on an <a href="https://www.developers.hspconsortium.org/events" target="_blank" title="https://www.developers.hspconsortium.org/events">HIT Developers Conference</a> this month in New Orleans (March 30-31). I'll be doing a talk on CDS Hooks (overview of the project, plans for 2017). There are some other great talks lined up that this community would find interesting.</p>
<p>If you're planning on attending, reply here and perhaps we can meetup as group during the conference.</p>
