<blockquote>
<p>Do you think hospitals will be quick or hesitant to adopt CDS Hooks?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think hospitals will be quick to adopt services that work, and that are well-supported by their existing technology vendors. In other words, a hospital that experiences CDS Hooks as just another (helpful, slick, modern) built-in features within their EHR will be the quickest to adopt. There's always a chicken and egg problem here, but in some cases we're seeing EHRs adopt CDS Hooks not as a replacement (or even a complement) to existing vendor-specific CDS APIS, but as their <em>first</em> externally-accessible CDS API.</p>

<p>Are there plans to expand CDS Hooks technology to other care settings such as physicians' offices or urgent care facilities?</p>

<p>Sure; there's no particular focus today on hospital care, and indeed, early implementers have included T System (emergency medicine focused) and also outpatient (athenahealth, for example) in addition to more hospital-centric systems. So far the hooks that we have defined tend to be pretty broadly applicable; at some point we might get into hooks that would make more sense in a particular care context.</p>
