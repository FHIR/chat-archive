<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We have some existing CDS products which have a use case on administration. <br>
Would I be right in saying that there currently isn't a hook for administration and if not, we are ok to suggest support for one? I would imagine if we did it would require extra implementation on the client side.</p>
<p>The basic flow of events would be something like:<br>
When a patient is about to have a medication administered<br>
The clinician starts the administration process<br>
Once the administration details are entered the application triggers the hook to process CDS<br>
The hook services check for issues with the administration e.g. overdose/underdose and sends cards back to the client.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="279019">@Dan miller</span> , yes, there's not currently a hook defined or proposed for medication administration. The <a href="https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/1.0/#hook-maturity-model">Hook Maturity Model</a> in the CDS Hooks spec describes the process for proposing and maturing hook definitions, I'd suggest writing up a hook definition with the proposed workflow there and submitting that as a PR for folks to comment on.</p>
