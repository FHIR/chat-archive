<p>Given this is now open to teaching.. Here is my tutorial on FHIR Privacy and Security -  <a href="https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2019/09/hl7-tutorial-fhir-privacy-and-security.html" target="_blank" title="https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2019/09/hl7-tutorial-fhir-privacy-and-security.html">https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2019/09/hl7-tutorial-fhir-privacy-and-security.html</a><br>
comments welcome. Always looking to improve it</p>

<p>After a brief review: rather text oriented. Less is more.. <br>
The problem (as I've also found) is that when it comes to this subject you either have a newbie to the subject (in which case this kind of material easily leads to information overload), or you have someone who already has an interest in the subject (in which case they need to become aware of advanced topics, which in turn will confuse the newbies). As such you'll need to decide what audience you're creating this for. <br>
You might try an example driven approach to help avoid information overload: sketch a use case, e.g. app accessing data in an EHR. Then illustrate all the various points/options based on the use case, to avoid all the options being un-connected 'fragments' in an overall security solution/architecture. <br>
As for the high amount of text: it's up to you in your role as a pundit to determine the underlying really important principles. If I were to ask you to do a 20-minute talk on the subject, for a IT-savy but non-security minded audience, what would your material be? That's your starting point. You can always add a "further reading" slide at the end with references, preferably materials (video, whitepaper, etc.) aimed at the same (newbie?) audience as your presentation.</p>

<p>I agree, I am just not that good at creating pictures... The third part of the deck is scenario based, so for an audience that has basics they will get more scenario based.</p>
