<p>The Extension-tracking-number has a valueIdentifier code for Birth Certificate (BCT) with a value of 15075 in the bundle-mdi-to-edrs-j-rogers example.   After examining the IG I was expecting a TrackingNumberType for the mdi-case-number and/or edrs-file-number.  Will these not be sent?  If not, is the 15075 equivalent to our edrs file number and if so, does this mean the examples are updates to an existing case within the edrs system as opposed to a new case?</p>

<p>Note that the extension tracking number cardinality is 0..*, so multiple identifiers are allowed to be sent, but currently there are not constraints/rules for what that tracking value is, where it comes from, when or who creates it, etc. Regarding your overarching question/point: what is an appropriate, meaningful tracking number here is key. Titles matter for extensions, but also descriptions and notes to make the intended appropriate use will be key.</p>
<p>The example containing '15075' in J Rogers example is likely from some other birth/death examples that were used as a starting point. But, any use of a birth certificate identifier is for this IG/scenario...definitely confusing and will be updated to a more appropriate/meaningful tracking identifier based on clarifications once we get clarity on how this tracking identifiers relates to other possible identifiers.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="369387">@Diana Wright</span>  The MDI case number in the test case  should match mdi-case-number in <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mdi-ig/ValueSet-ValueSet-tracking-number-type.html#logical-definition-cld">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mdi-ig/ValueSet-ValueSet-tracking-number-type.html#logical-definition-cld</a>. Right?  </p>
<p>I think we can also add edrs-file-number to use for our update api testing.</p>

<p>Even if the cardinality is 0..*, the IG does indicate the binding for the valueIdentifier to valueSet, <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mdi/ValueSet/ValueSet-tracking-number-type">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mdi/ValueSet/ValueSet-tracking-number-type</a>. So Yes, I think having an example that shows this binding would be very helpful. And the the valueSet system has three options to choose (refer to <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mdi-ig/ValueSet-ValueSet-tracking-number-type.html#expansion">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mdi-ig/ValueSet-ValueSet-tracking-number-type.html#expansion</a>).</p>
<p>And, it wouldn't be a bad idea to restrict the values to this binding.</p>
