<p>Hi All, </p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/10155/iJhzH34lTlXHQrkrO1YkK5QG/Da-Vinci-PCT-Ready-to-Vote-and-Apply-Tickets_02_02_2022.xlsx">Da-Vinci-PCT-Ready-to-Vote-and-Apply-Tickets_02_02_2022.xlsx</a> </p>
<p>As Promised, attached is a list of tickets that are Persuasive, not marked for "in person" and the core team feels are not controversial. (note two tabs) Therefore, we intend to move forward in the voting and applying to the IG process.  There are 9 change requests and 13 technical corrections. Please reach out to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="331378">@Vanessa Candelora</span>  with specific ticket numbers if you would like to discuss them.  If you notify me by EOD Thursday (2/3) prior to our Friday at 11am ET open working call, I will add them to the agenda.   </p>
<p>Next step for the Change Requests are to bring the block vote to FM. <br>
Next step for the technical corrections are to apply the changes to the IG, no voting necessary.  <br>
Thank you.  <br>
