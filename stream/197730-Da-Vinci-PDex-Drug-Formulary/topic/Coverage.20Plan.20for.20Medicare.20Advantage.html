<p>For Medicare Advantage Plan, the Plan ID should be CMS Contract Number for each Coverage Plan. We have more than one formulary plan for a particular CMS contract. The issue is FormularyDrug.DrugPlanID must be a reference to CoveragePlan.identifier which is CMS contract number. In this case, I'll have to create multiple CoveragePlan for same contract number to represent multiple drug plan. Also there will be multiple FormularyDrug but I don't know which CoveragePlan should I link from FormularyDrug. I assume this is common for Medicare Advantage Plan and appreciate your feedback on how to represent this correctly.</p>
