<p>There are times that we add drugs to our formulary before an RXCUI is created.  When the IG indicates that we must return back an RxNORM ID, we are interpreting that to mean an RXCUI.  For those cases in which we have added a drug prior to the creation of an RxCUI, we were planning to report back the NDC.  There are two problems with this approach.</p>
<ol>
<li>Version 1.0.1 makes RxNorm required instead of extensible.  What is the recommended approach for these drugs that don't have an RXCui?</li>
<li>For those drugs that don't have an RXCUI, we have a  proxy NDC to represent that drug.  That proxy NDC could end up changing.  Does the FHIR logical ID assigned to the first NDC have to be used for the new NDC? For example, NDC of 59148003085 gets a FHIR logical ID 12345.  It gets a new proxy NDC before it is assigned an RXCUI.  Should the new proxy NDC of 4444900308 get a new FHIR logical ID or should it get 12345?  Does it matter?  When the RXCUI gets assigned, should it reflect a FHIR logical ID of 12345?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="331329">@Courtney Bland</span> <br>
The issue of drugs that do not yet have an RXCUI has never been previously discussed in the context of the Formulary IG.<br>
The <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1/ValueSet-us-core-medication-codes.html">Value Set</a> used by the IG for the medication code defines the subset of RxNorm codes as "Include codes from <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm</a> where TTY in SCD,SBD,GPCK,BPCK,SCDG,SBDG,SCDF,SBDF".</p>
<p>I think you raise several issues questions:<br>
1) In <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-medication.html">US Core Medication</a>, the binding to the same Value Set is 'extensible'.  Shouldn't it be extensible here to deal with drugs that do not yet have an RxNorm code?   -- <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-31579">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-31579</a><br>
2) Assuming an extensible binding, for a given drug how should the not-so-stable NDC code be managed relative to the FHIR id?   </p>
<p>I think both of these would benefit from discussion at the Friday PDEX call.  (My personal take on #2 is that the only stable element of the FormularyDrug is its code, so if the code is unstable, I would suggest allocating a new FHIR id for each incarnation.  But I would like to have this confirmed by wiser folks.)</p>

<p>Hello <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="215604">@Saul Kravitz</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="222957">@Dave Hill</span> .  Thank you for the message.<br>
Unfortunately, I do not have an example to share.  We don't currently store, in any of our databases, when an RxCUI becomes available.  RxCUI is not considered a critical data element in our systems as they stand today.  The feedback was provided by our business partners based on their experiences, but they did not have a precise example to supply.  Since we will be going live relatively soon, we have decided to record an error for any drug in our formulary that does not have an RXCUI at the time the record is supposed to be created for the Formulary Profile or the Coverage Profile in our database.  That drug will not be returned back in any API response until an RXCUI is generated.  If the consuming app asks for that specific drug by name or NDC, they will given the standard message indicating that a record was not found.  If this situation occurs after we go live, then we will provide the examples that you seek from our error log.  It would be great if we could see what other payers might think on the matter.  cc <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="360036">@Mark Neumuth</span></p>

<p>I'm running into the same situation as well. We covered this proxy NDC 50924088401 but there is no associated RxCUI yet. We are also considering not creating a FormularyDrug resource for drug without RxCUI.</p>

That NDC is linked to RxCUI 2004255 and all it says is that the link is not curated by NLM and the concept is "PROPRIETARY" and is not current.  It is not even clear if this is used as a placeholder for a specific thing or a general thing, so stay tuned. Please give us more information on what that drug actually is. Is it a pre-release drug, investigational, a special compounding?</p>

<p>Here is the update on <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194834">@Tun Naing</span> 's NDC - it represents a glucose test strip which is not in scope for RxNorm. This is a great example. So we are going to have an issue given the current Required binding to <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/ValueSet-us-core-medication-codes.html">USCoreMedicationCodes</a> <strong>if</strong> formularies are going to include things defined as out of scope, like test strips. Yes, we could make the binding extensible but that is a big opening (as I noted before) when I'd rather determine how to represent the few known <em>types</em> of things that are out of scope. I'm setting up a discussion with NLM, but we need more examples of these non-drug items that are on formularies. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="222957">@Dave Hill</span></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span>  - I  do want to say that I think this is the exception and not the (Rx)Norm (sorry, couldn't resist!). But it does seem to happen more with OTC products, like the Test Strips mentioned above. Usually, only diabetic supply OTCs are pulled into the formulary. But we have seen with some Medicaid formularies a lot more OTC products that are added. Not all of these even have NDC product types. They only have UPC codes. But we do put the UPC product ID on the formulary.</p>
<p>I found an example from one Medicaid Formulary of an OTC that only has UPC products that I can't find in RxNav.</p>
<p>CALCIUM CARBONATE-CHOLECALCIFEROL TAB 333 MG-133 UNIT<br>
I believe this would use ingredient calcium carbonate / cholecalciferol [RxCUI = 608343]<br>
But I don't see this strength in the list of Clinical Drug Components [SCDC]<br>

<p>Based on discussion with the RxNorm folks, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="217850">@Kate Dech</span> they are also finding UPC codes in submitted information masquerading as NDC codes and they ignore those. They reconfirmed that OTC content will remain out of scope. </p>
<p>They shared a detailed analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recently conducted a review of 1.7B prescriptions from claims data collected from private insurance companies. Here is the breakdown of the NDCs after analysis with the RxNorm API.<br>
The status of the API returned by the API is one of:<br>
ACTIVE. The NDC is recognized by RxNorm as active and is associated with an active concept. The RxCUI associated with the NDC is contained in the returned history data.<br>
OBSOLETE. The NDC previously existed in RxNorm, but is no longer recognized as active. The history data will indicate the time periods and RxCUI(s) associated with the NDC.<br>
ALIEN. The NDC is or was contained only in a source vocabulary other than RxNorm. This status means that the NDC has never been active in RxNorm.<br>
UNKNOWN. The NDC is unknown or invalid. This means that the NDC has never been active in RxNorm, is not in a source vocabulary other than RxNorm, and no history data is available.<br>
Active and obsolete NDCs are curated by RxNorm, as opposed to alien NDCs, only known from some sources, but not curated by RxNorm. Unknown NDCs are absent from RxNorm.<br>
[omitted table]<br>
The vast majority of the NDCs (80%) and even more of the prescriptions (89.3%) correspond to NDCs curated by RxNorm, active or obsolete. Alien NDCs tend to correspond to OTCs, supplements and supplies. They represent a significant proportion of NDCs (14.9%), but relatively few prescriptions (1.6%). Unknown NDCs are uncommon and negligible (0.1%) in terms of prescriptions.</p>
<p>These results are consistent with similar analyses performed on the Medicare dataset over several billion prescriptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that if we <strong>must</strong> represent <strong>ALL CONTENT OF FORMULARIES</strong> we can not bind required to <strong>only</strong> RxNorm. The <em>best</em> approach would be to find a code system we can use to represent <em>types</em> that the UPC codes or NDC codes could be mapped to for exchange, similar to what we do for drugs. I have not done an analysis to determine what we might use for an OTC code system. </p>
<p>I must note that the analysis does show there are <em>rare, but existing</em> drug formulary items that are not in RxNorm. So, a decision that we MUST have all formulary items <strong>encoded</strong> when exchanged may force us to open the binding up to Extensible. Perhaps an alternative would be to come up with a one or more concepts to be used when not in RxNorm and then the actual item can be sent in text along with the generic code we create.</p>
