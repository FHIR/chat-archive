<p>On the formularies that we share with CMS, we have instances of more than one drug that possess the same RXCUI, but are treated as different drugs.  We currently have RXCUI as part of the primary key for our Medication Knowledge/Formulary Drug records so a member won’t get back more than one record with the same RXCUI.  We were hoping to get some advice on how we should handle this scenario.<br>
RXCUI: 309686<br>
Display Name:  Dexamethasone (Oral Liquid)<br>
Full Name:  dexamethasone 0.1 MG/ML Oral Solution<br>
NDC 60432046608 is for Dexamethasone 0.5 mg / 5 mL <strong>Elixir</strong> Bottle 8 oz.<br>
NDC 00054317763 is for Dexamethasone 0.5 mg / 5 mL <strong>Solution</strong> Bottle 500 mL<br>
Both NDCs share the same RXCUI of 309686, according to the NIH, but they are considered different drugs on our formulary because one is an Elixir and one is a Solution.  In many cases, multiple NDCs pointing to the same RXCUI is not an issue because they really are the same drug, but we do have these instances in which they are different.</p>
