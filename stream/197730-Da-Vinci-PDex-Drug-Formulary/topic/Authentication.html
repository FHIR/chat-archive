<p>Our Patient Access API will require authentication for the third party application as well as the member. We (Aetna) have been discussing how non-member requests would be handled since they cannot be authenticated. After researching and taking all input into consideration we have made the decision to support only member-specific Formulary Services on day 1. @Dave Hill @Saul Kravitz @Robert Dieterle <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192609">@Mark Scrimshire</span>  - I'm making you aware as this topic (authentication) was touched upon in a recent HL7/DaVinci PDex call.</p>
