<p>Hi Dave, Sloan,</p>
<p>CVS Aetna is implementing PDex Formulary and we are looking for some guidance and have some questions about the Implementation Guides. We didn't make it to the Connectathon 25 Formulary track, but I was there for the readout last Friday. For example: during the HL7 webinar we saw pricing/cost information being displayed. However, to get pricing/cost data requires multiple steps, such as selection of a particular pharmacy. Just checking, are you the right individuals to reach out to on questions like this or can you point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>
