<p>I brought this concern back to a few of the designers of the authenticated access. The table correctly specifies the expected behavior, though could be clearer. Specifically, the idea for column 3 is that the search is meant to be for plans available other than a plan the member currently has. You could consider this as a search for other plans available. This section should be made more clear and address any expectations regarding searching on FormularyItem and FormularyDrug. I have created a Jira ticket: <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-36330">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-36330</a></p>

<p>Thank you for the feedback and the JIRA. I will watch the JIRA as it goes through the workflow so that we can incorporate the logic properly. </p>
<p>While we wait for those other details, I have one unresolved question. If I use the frame of reference that column 3 is a a search for plans or a search for plans other than what the patient/member has selected, I can understand every table cell except for the zero results that are expected when the user has selected a plan, but is not part of a group (e.g. "Plan selected/no group").  Using the frame of reference you provided for column 3, that user is not allowed to search for other plans as the expected result in all cases is "Zero plans returned (200)."</p>
<p>What is unique about "Plan selected/no group" that we don't allow them or want them to search for plans?</p>
