<p>I'm importing MedicationKnowledge into our FHIR store, and I'm stuck on two things:</p>
<p>1) There doesn't appear to be any concept of "identity" for a MedicationKnowledge (such as <code>identifier</code>). In my case a MedicationKnowledge unique is plan id + drug tier id + code + "member benefit group". I've very much like to import these with a create-or-update-if-necessary process.  Did I missing something here or do I really need to search by the intersection of these fields in order to determine if the MedicationKnowledge is already present?</p>
<p>2) Do folks here know of a way that I can represent the "member benefit group" with the MedicationKnowledge? Maybe as some form of custom extension (that's still searchable somehow)?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>1) If this is your data store, you are free to handle the update process as you see fit. The IG provides a baseline for interoperability between trading partners. It expresses what must and should be present. The Formulary does not disallow a server from supporting or populating more fields. You should just not expect a client to know or do anything with them beyond what is defined in the base standard without some additional out of band agreement. As you mention, you could conceivably use something like an identifier or a meta tag to manage you own backend resource update processes.</p>
<p>2) I have not heard of any requirements around a need to represent and search for records based on a member benefit group. Could you further explain the goal? Is this something we need to consider for the IG? If this is just something you are doing to meet another business need or to just extend the functionality of your interface, there is nothing in the IG stopping you from adding a new searchable extension to your implementation. Again, the use of that by clients would be out of the expectation of the IG.</p>
