<p>I have a related question to <a href="#narrow/stream/197730-Da-Vinci.20PDex.20Drug.20Formulary/topic/CostSharing.20.20Extension">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/197730-Da-Vinci.20PDex.20Drug.20Formulary/topic/CostSharing.20.20Extension</a>.</p>
<p>What is the guidance for populating coinsurance rate (required) when there is only a copayment amount for a tier/pharmacy type? Likewise, what should be populated for copayment money amount when there is only a coinsurance?</p>
<p>There is a coinsurance option of "no charge" but that can be misconstrued as meaning there is no charge to the member. (And the definition of this is that deductible doesn't apply, not that there isn't a value.)  </p>
<p>There is a difference between a $0 copayment and null copayment. Likewise, 0% coinsurance could be interpreted as "no patient pay" (and 100% looks like full member pay).   Can we use the no data absent extension to explicitly state there is no copayment amount  or coinsurance?</p>
<p>Also, have there been any discussions about scenarios where there is both a copayment and coinsurance where comparators are needed for less of/greater of applies?</p>

<p>Here's some additional information to consider.. <br>
A coworker sent me a link to public information about <a href="http://Finder.HealthCare.gov">Finder.HealthCare.gov</a> and their APIs for rendering health plans available outside the Health Insurance Marketplace (non-qualified plans) but they appear to follow much of the structure of the QHP data dictionary for sending HIOS plans to CMS.  <a href="https://finder.healthcare.gov/#services/version_3_0">https://finder.healthcare.gov/#services/version_3_0</a><br>
If you look at their last example (getSMGPlanBenefits Samples), they have a plan with (+) copay amounts and no coinsurance. The coinsurance rate is not included and the coinsurance option is 'no charge'.  They also have a value for just 'flat copay' (first highlighted example) for a tier that isn't subject to the deductible (while the second tier is).<br>
