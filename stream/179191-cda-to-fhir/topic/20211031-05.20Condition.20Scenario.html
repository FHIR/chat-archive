<p>Scenario: Adding to the scenario described in 20211031-02, Before the conclusion of the visit, the practitioner decides, based on her diagnosis of the patient's condition at this visit, that the patient should get some physical therapy for to minimize the symptoms the patient's is experiencing and potentially resolve the problem.  The office staff get an appointment scheduled for the patient at a Physical Therapy practice. The staff person clicks on a button which causes the EHR to generate a referral note summarizing the patient's situation and requesting physical therapy services to be performed. She sends it to the Physical Therapy practice.</p>
<p>At the moment when the digital Referral Note document is generated by EHR and focusing only on the representation of the patient's main problem to be addressed:</p>
<p>What resource would be used in FHIR to represent this information? (Any specific details?)</p>
<p>Who is the recorder? Who is the asserter?</p>
<p>Who is the author? Who is the informant? Who is the performer?</p>
