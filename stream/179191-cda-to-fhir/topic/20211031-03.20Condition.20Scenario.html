<p>Scenario: Adding to the scenario described in 20211031-01, After examining the patient the practitioner comes to the conclusion (based on her judgement of the situation and the information she has considered) that the patient has or might have a specific "named" condition. At this practice, the doctor focuses solely on interacting with the patient and family members at the visit and the physician's assistant interacts with the EHR.</p>
<p>At the moment when the practitioner's assistant is documenting the practitioner's judgement of the patient's condition (diagnosis) in her EHR:</p>
<p>What resource would be used in FHIR to represent this information? (Any specific details?)</p>
<p>Who is the recorder? Who is the asserter?</p>
<p>Who is the author? Who is the informant? Who is the performer?</p>
