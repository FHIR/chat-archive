<p>Hi There. We have a need to establish mappings into FHIR for all of the C-CDA Entry templates.  The US Core Profiles only address a few of the entries that correspond to the Common Clinical Data Set, but for C-CDA on FHIR, we need to provide guidance to implementers for each of the existing C-CDA entry templates.  I've established this thread as a place to seek input on this task.  My first questions are broad.  Is this the right place to work through the needed mappings?  What will it take to establish the correct mapping of a C-CDA Entry template to something in FHIR? I'm assuming the mapping would be to a base FHIR Resource, but will that be sufficient?  When a C-CDA Entry is a "compound' statement that strings together an act with entry relationships to observation, how will that map to FHIR?  What if the C-CDA Entry template is a procedure that includes an entryRelationship to an obsersvation, how will that map to a base FHIR Resource?  What advice can you provide as we get started on the job of mapping all the C-CDA Entry templates that are not addressed by US Core Profiles?</p>
