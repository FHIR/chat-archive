<p>Scenario: A patient or related person is using an app to maintain a record of personal health issues. In that system of record, the patient or a related person asserts a health concern, complaint, or symptom the patient has been or is experiencing.  The practitioner receives a document generated by that system, reads it, and uses that information to enter encounter information into her own EHR. She reads what the person or related person wrote, then documents the issue that was communicated in the document by the patient or related person.</p>
<p>At the moment when the practitioner is documenting the patient's or related person's expressed concerns in her EHR:</p>
<p>What resource would be used in FHIR to represent this information? (Any specific details?)</p>
<p>Who is the recorder? Who is the asserter?</p>
<p>Who is the author? Who is the informant? Who is the performer?</p>
