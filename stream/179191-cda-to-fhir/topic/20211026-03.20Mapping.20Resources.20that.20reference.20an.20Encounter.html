<p><strong>A resource may refer to an encounter. This could be equivalent to a document encompassing encounter or a separate encounter (in Encounters section). How should this be handled?</strong></p>
<p>Proposed Resolution: <br>
FC: It would only be appropriate to populate the encompassing encounter if the document being created is about that encounter.  A referenced encounter can be added by adding an Encounter Activity entry in an Encounter Section and then referencing that entry by using the Entry Reference template within the entry that is being created.</p>
