<p>Hi FHIR community. We are looking for a reliable way to connect Encounters to clinical instances (e.g., procedure, condition, etc.) when converting CCD to FHIR. It seems that aligning CCD encounter clinical entry dates would not work in most cases and may lead to error. Generating a FHIR Encounter from a CCD encompassing encounter works nicely, but the resulting FHIR Encounter would lack required properties such as class and type, thus requiring a dataAbsentReason. Has anyone considered this approach? From a FHIR standpoint, does it seem reasonable? Thanks for any guidance you can give.</p>

<p>If you are working with a CCD, you don't generally have to have an encompassingEncounter (as encounter is defined in V3), it could just be a summarization over a period of time, or it could be the CCD for a given visit.  You might consider aligning based on date from encounter elements in the Encounter section when it is present.  Codesystemz for FHIR Encounter type and class are Example and Extensible, so you should be able to find an appropriate code value to use to express a physician encounter that doesn't carry the essential details about setting or specialty.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This may sound like a dumb question. Im converting the CCDA to FHIR resources, We wanted to get the <strong>problems List</strong> section data from CCDA. Im using the <strong>Condition</strong> resource for this. </p>
<p>What I see is not many  CCDA uses the ICD.10 code to capture the problem. Sometime they use the &lt;Translation value&gt; where they mention the ICD codes. Many times in the value section, they have only SNOMED.  </p>
<p>Is there a CCDA standard that enforces the EMR to provide both these codes?</p>
