<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191336">@Michel Rutten</span> using Forge is really slow and frustrating. Actually, no, profiling is really slow and frustrating. Forge kind of magnifies it a little because it is slow to move from element to element. but what would really save me a lot of time is to be able to right click on an element, and turn all it's children off - set cardinality to 0..0 for anything that doesn't have min  = 1</p>

<p>another thing that would be just sensational - though there are many difficulties - is to copy/paste stuff. I have a set of constraints on .subject that is the same in all my profiles...</p>

<p>Also, on References, this sequence keeps catching me out:<br>
- I set cardinality for children to 0..0<br>
- then I set .reference to 1..1 and update it's documentation to what I want<br>
- then I remember to uncheck all the possible target profiles on the Reference itself, and check the one that applies<br>
- and now I have lost anything I applied to the chidlren</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>, thank you for your feedback!<br>
We could certainly implement a (context menu) command to strike all child elements of the selected node. Never thought about it before, but I see how this would be useful.<br>
Regarding element navigation, maybe we could implement some handy keyboard shortcuts to traverse the element tree. Would that be helpful?<br>
Copy/paste would be really convenient, but unfortunately this is not so easy to implement, as it involves dynamically merging complex (sub)trees and dealing with discrepancies. I'd love to provide such a feature, but realistically, I don't expect this to happen soon. For now, our main priority is to correctly handle the advanced use cases, as we see an increasing complexity in profiles that users try to create.</p>

<p>As for constraining references, if you change the datatype of a (polymorphic) element, Forge will try to re-expands all child elements. This allows you to author complex (deep) constraints on e.g. valueCodeableConcept. However it also implies that when you modify the datatype of an element, you inevitably loose all the existing child constraints. I'm open for suggestions on how to improve this.<br>
The problem somewhat resembles copy/paste, as an ideal solution would involve merging complex subtrees and gracefully dealing with discrepancies (i.e. trying to maintain all compatible constraints after changing the datatype). Currently, Forge doesn't even try to perform a merge, but simply discards all existing child constraints.</p>

<p>I follow the logic of why changing the type resets the elements. But right now, changing the targetProfile resets them. That's the bit I don't appreciate. Changes to targetProfile should not change the child eleements</p>

<p>Forge tries to apply/merge target profiles on the fly, in order to show the inherited constraints from the external profile so the author can then further constrain the elements. Anyway, that is the intent.</p>

<p>e.g. an external target profile might introduce slices and/or extensions that you'd like to see inlined in the tree.</p>

<p>I don't follow how that would happen at all. not for <em>targetProfile</em>. Of course that would be on for the profile element</p>

<p>I think your're right... This looks like a symptom from DSTU2 =&gt; STU3 migration. I'll revisit the event logic, seems like I should disable child re-expansion for .targetProfile.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> FYI I've improved the logic responsible for expanding element type profiles. Forge now only performs (re-)expansion when necessary, i.e. when the (common) element type and/or profile has changed. Changes to the .targetProfile property no longer trigger re-expansion.<br>
The improvement will be included in the upcoming new release.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>, you suggested the following feature request:<br>
"but what would really save me a lot of time is to be able to right click on an element, and turn all it's children off - set cardinality to 0..0 for anything that doesn't have min = 1"<br>
Could you explain use case(s) when such a command would be useful? Would you mostly use this to profile e.g. ResourceReferences?<br>
Trying to determine if/how useful this would in general.</p>

<p>when I'm profiling resources for actual implementations, I find that there's a lot of labor involved. One common operation I do is turn everything 'off' and then bring back what I'm going to use. I've found that I've missed things by getting distracted by the logic of what I'm doing.</p>
