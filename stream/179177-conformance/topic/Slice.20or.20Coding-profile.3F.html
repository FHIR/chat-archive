<p>Dear community, <br>
sorry if my question is quite simple, I just want to confirm my theory or have it contradicted:</p>
<p>I'm in the area of nursing summaries. There I have nursing problems, nursing goals, and nursing procedures. For them I can use classifications, e.g. NANDA &amp; NIC, ICNP, LEP, and SNOMED CT. In our nursing summary  we currently don't restrict to one classification but leave it open to the IT systems. Therefore we have no constraints to cardinality etc. </p>
<p>My theory now is: If I profile this in Forge and want to tell people which <code>system</code> should be used in which context (e.g. <code>urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.6.97</code> for ICNP) I have the following options:</p>
<ol>
<li>make an open slice, add slices for each CodeSystem, and set codeSystem to a fixed value,</li>
<li>profile Coding for each CodeSystem, make an open slice, slice for each CodeSystem, and reduce the type to the corresponding Coding, or</li>
<li>profile Coding for each CodeSystem and add them as Profiles for the Type(s),<br>
and these options are equivalent to each other, as no more constraints are made.<br>
Am I right</li>
</ol>
<p>One minor drawback of 1. would be that if I get a CanonicalURL for one these classifications, I would have to look at each resource. Using Coding-profiles would just mean changing one profile.</p>
<p>And before someone tells me: I know that Canonicals are preferred to OIDs, but as I do only have OIDs for most of the classifications, this is better than nothing. Those who have canonicalURLs are invited to contribute to <a href="#narrow/stream/179202-terminology/topic/canonicals.20for.20classifications.20of.20nursing.20interventions" title="#narrow/stream/179202-terminology/topic/canonicals.20for.20classifications.20of.20nursing.20interventions">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179202-terminology/topic/canonicals.20for.20classifications.20of.20nursing.20interventions</a>. <span aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes" class="emoji emoji-1f601" role="img" title="grinning face with smiling eyes">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span></p>

<p>I think #1 is likely to be the most straightforward and understandable, based on how I'm reading your descriptions.  It's a little unclear to me how you are envisioning that #2 and #3 would look using the multiple profiles on Coding.  Maybe you could share some examples?</p>

<p>Creating profiles for each Coding is a lot of extra effort/maintenance, and the effect wouldn't be any different, so option #1 would be preferred.</p>
<p>Note: would strongly recommend submitting a change request asking for a URL for ICNP rather than going with urn:oid.</p>

<p>Thanks for your replies. <br>
As you, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span>, asked for examples: <br>
For #2 an example would be <a href="https://simplifier.net/germanenursingsummary/gensnursingprocedure" target="_blank" title="https://simplifier.net/germanenursingsummary/gensnursingprocedure">https://simplifier.net/germanenursingsummary/gensnursingprocedure</a>.<br>
For #3 an example would be <a href="https://simplifier.net/germanenursingsummary/gensnursingproblem" target="_blank" title="https://simplifier.net/germanenursingsummary/gensnursingproblem">https://simplifier.net/germanenursingsummary/gensnursingproblem</a>.</p>
<p>In the corresponding implementation guide we now have #2 and #3, and I would like to reduce it to one option.</p>
<p>Also please note for the <code>urn:oid</code>part: I know that the use of <code>urn:oid</code>should be avoided, that's why  I started the topic linked above. There I wrote that I submitted a change request. This request is currently waiting to be processed.</p>
