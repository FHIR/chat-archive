<p>About two months ago I volunteered to speak about 'GraphDefinition' at the upcoming Amsterdam DevDays - volunteering to speak about a subject I know little of is a good way to motivate me to start looking at something in earnest. It turns out there are many open issues related to the exact use cases as well as the specification of the resource.<br>
Question for this forum: if we regard GraphDefintion as a conformance resource (for it defines a constraint in the form of a specific graph of resource types), could/may one claim conformance to it in a resource (e.g. a "graph=canonical_url" meta tag) ? Think of a Composition resource which wishes to claim conformance to a particular document structure (graph).<br>
Related question: can a message claim conformance to a MessageDefintion resource?</p>

<p>We had talked about the notion of DomainResource.meta.profile being able to point to GraphDefinition, but I don't think we have any language that specifically allows that yet.  (We'd need to think about the implications for backward compatibility too.)</p>

<p>For messaging, obviously a more 'RESTful' way for messages to work is to drop 'event' and just point to the canonical URL of the MessageDefinition.  However, that might freak people out a bit.  It might be appropriate to have a choice?  (eventCode or Reference(MessageDefinition))</p>

<p>And would we want GraphDefintion declared on the root-resource of a Graph, or on the bundle (if the graph is contained in the bundle, a graph need not have a root node) ? The current GraphDefinition resource is a rooted graph, there are pros/cons to that.</p>

<p>Re: messaging - well, the trigger could be "A01", but depending on the context the actual structure could differ on a system by system basis. Same trigger, different GraphDefinition. After all, next to the focal resources there's a lot of variability in message content.</p>

<p>I don't really understand the point of a rootless GraphDefinition, though I'm not opposed if you make a case for it.  In terms of "identified nodes", that's easy enough to do, but what about situations where you have a Patient which is referenced by multiple Encounters and there's a need to ensure that certain content links to specific encounters.</p>

<p>Re: identified nodes: In the latter case you'd have a graph with multiple encounter nodes (explicit nodes), not just one generic node which could occur /be instantiated multiple times. This way you can define that one of the encounter nodes has to have an inbound reference from some other resources.</p>

<p>A rooted graph only makes sense if one has a rooted instance-graph, which may be true for documents or messages but won't be true for all fhir instance graphs. <br>
Let's assume that GraphDef  'example' defines [a graph with a Patient resource, which must have a 1..1 inbound reference from a weight Observation resource, and the Patient resource shall have a 1..1 outbound reference to an Organization].<br>
If I instantiate this and have 3 resources Pat, Obs and Org, then either one of those (or all of them) can claim conformance to 'example'. Effectively the resource would state "I'm a node in a instance-graph, and seen from here I'm compliant to a specific GraphDef", or "As a node in an instance graph I was created in compliance with a specific GraphDef".</p>

<p>In the encounter scenario, the graph wouldn't identify how many encounters there should be, only the expected behavior for content nested within a particular encounter.  So the graph couldn't assign a specific 'id' to each encounter.</p>
<p>In your example, I'm looking for a practical benefit.  For FHIR IG validation, so long as one of the resources declared the graph, you'd get identical validation.  (And declaring the graph 3 times would actually force triple the work - and a need to suppress duplicate errors/warnings.)  So I'm not really seeing the benefit.</p>

<p>The only benefit is in situations were it would be difficult to identify a root, other than by randomly picking one of the resources in the graph and declare a profile meta tag on it. E.g. a graph of resource instances which conforms to a data set (or dare I say: a graph of logical model definitions). Such instance graphs don't have a root. Randomly picking one will work however.</p>

<p>Why not? A node in a GraphDefintion defines what profiled resource type we're talking about, plus expresses expectations as to inbound and outbound references. Thus, if there are encounters which differ in their definition (wrt strucDef profiles, inbound/outbound references)  from other encounters, they are represented by two different nodes in the graphDefinition, and hence have different ids. </p>
<p>In mother/child scenarios, with 2 encounters, one of them must have an outbound reference (the one about the child), and another must have an inbound reference (the one about the mother). If we want to have the encounter (for the child) to also have a 1..* inbound reference from a Observation [profiled, to be a Billirubin observation], the two encounters nodes have different definitions in the GraphDef. In order for the Billirubin Observation type [a node in the GraphDef] to be able to reference the 'correct' encounter type, we need an id on all nodes in the GraphDef (just defining 'this needs a reference to Encounter' won't cut it [this is what the current GraphDef does], because there are two encounter types/nodes in the GraphDef). Theoretically one could create a single encounter-instance that would comply with both the encounter types as defined in the GraphDef, so we'd need an additional rule [akin to the rules we have in the current GraphDef] to state that the encounter instances should be different, and that there should be one of node X and one for node Y. </p>
<p>The confusing thing in Graphdefs is that we're talking about a resource-type graph, which may have many resource-instance graphs as valid instances of it. That's certainly one of the key messages I'll try to convey during my presentation.</p>

<p>The primary use-cases we have for GraphDefinition right now are documents, messages and queries (e.g. all diabetes data for a patient, data that should be included in the discharge summary for an encounter).  All of those have a root.  I'm not really understanding your 'data set' or 'logical model' examples - why would those not have a root?</p>
<p>I'm not arguing that you <em>couldn't</em> have specific individual identified nodes in a graph that  you'd want to point to.  I'm saying that there will be other cases where you might want to point to a non-identified node.  E.g. A graph could have 0..* encounters.  However, within the subgraph beneath those encounters, all of the resources would be required to point to the encounter they're a sub-graph of.  If we can do that, then presumably we can handle the individual identified node situation too.</p>

<p>Agree that in the described sub-graph scenario the id would be superfluous, because it can be implicitly identified as well. But for other scenarios, you'd need an id, so in my mind we'd better ensure that all nodes have a unique id.</p>

<p>I do understand that the primary use cases happen to have a root - but the mother/child+encounters+observations model mentioned earlier on does not. Nor does a 'QA dataset based on lab observations for multiple patients'. One could have a rule that says that in a single-patient graph, that the patient shall be seen as the root, but that's very arbitrary, one could also pick the encounter, or any other resource to be the root. In my mind it doesn't matter that much, as long as the GraphDefintion defines the graph not as a a tree-like structure (which is what the current GraphDef does), but as a 'true graph'.</p>

<p>We have the ability to put ids everywhere already.  It's more a question of how to reference.  If the graph definition nodes are x..1, then the id will refer to a single node in the instance.  What I'd like to figure out is what referencing the id would mean if the referenced node was x..*.</p>
<p>In the mother-child case, you'd either have a graph for a pregnancy, where root is mother and graph includes all children, or you'd have graph for a single birth where root is a child and graph includes just the mother.  I don't understand the use-case for rootless graph in that scenario.  I don't understand the QA dataset example.  Having a rootless graph increases complexity of definition and of referencing, so we should have a pressing use-case if we're going to go that way.</p>

<p>I don't want the id to be about resource-instances at all, but I'd like them to define a node in the type-definition-graph. if I have a node which is a "us-core-patient which shall have a 1..* inbound reference from a us-core-observation", it needs an id. Otherwise I'll never be able to distinguish it from a "us-core-patient which shall have a 1..* inbound reference from a us-core-encounter" node. If I'm at any other node somewhere in the graph you'd need to express "..and from this node, you'd have a 1..1 outbound reference to node [someId]". Currently nodes in Graphdef don't have an id. That's exactly what the problem is. The endpoint of an edge is currently defined by using a StucDef name - that's not sufficient, in my example that would be "us-core-patient". A node in a GraphDef is about more than just what's in a StrucDef.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, Rene is hinting at allowing GraphDefinition to first define nodes in the graph with "virtual" identifiers (separate from resource id), then define the relationships between the nodes by referring to the previously introduced identifiers. A single virtual node id could represent a group/category of instances.</p>

<p>Right.  But if a node represents a group/category but you want others below a particular member of that group to point to that specific member, we need to do more than just point back to the group.</p>

<p>It depends. This morning I came to the realisation that one can see GrahpDefinition as something that closely mimics the resulting instance-graph. Thus a GraphDef for a "Patient which SHALL have 3 inbound subject references from Observations, and which SHALL have 3 inbound references from Encounters" could be fully expanded to a GraphDef with 7 nodes. Or, as I had in mind originally, it could be a concise type graph, so there'd be only 3 nodes (there are only 3 types). Now what if we added a rule to state that "each Observation shall have a reference to a different Encounter resource" - that's easier to define in the 7 node (expanded) expression than in the 3 node (concise) expression. In the latter case we'd need some special rules around the instances, perhaps using some FHIRPath expression.  The current GraphDef has a similar set of rules on instances, using compartments.<br>
The expanded model however doesn't work if we have open ended cardinalities e.g. 1..*.  As such we'll always have problems related to what i called the concise graph definitions, and we'll need some special stuff to make statements about instances.</p>

<p>Thinking about Lloyd's example scenario. We could describe constraints for such a graph by introducing multiple "virtual" node identifiers for the same profile. The edge list would describe how the different nodes are linked within the graph. For example, node list introduces patients P1 and P2, both conforming the <code>MyPatientProfile</code>. Some edges would connect to P2, other edges to P2. The edge list describes the shape of the graph. The algorithm to verify conformance would need to be more advanced than a simple tree walk, i.e. memorize already visited nodes to handle cycles.</p>

<p>If a structure allows for * patients (n2's in my graph), there's no knowing ahead of time how many patients will be instantiated, so taking care of it that way sounds problematic. IMHO a constraint on the edges sounds like a solution that's easy to understand and implement.</p>

<p>I don't think it would be problematic. The actual number of  instances that fit a specific position in the graph is initially unbounded ( <code>0...*</code>) and can be constrained by the graph definition. Each node represents a set of <code>0...*</code> instances in a specific position in the graph, associated with a unique virtual identifier that is referenced by edge definitions. Different nodes can conform to the same profile, but connected to different edges. A validator would need to match actual instances to nodes (advanced, but algorithms exist).<br>
Such an approach would allow defining constraints on any type of graph, not limited to trees. Again, not sure if the additional complexity is warranted, but it seems possible if required.</p>

<p>Patient may have multiple encounters, and encounters are referenced by tons of clinical resources (let's call it graph C) associated with that encounter. But so is the patient (lots of references from C), and a Concern resource may have references from multiple encounters (C graph instances). So if we define a sub graph C, we'll have to accept it has external references. If it's not allowed to have any of those, then having subgraphs will only help in a small subclass of the problem space.<br>

<p>Another issue is the 'direction of the edges'. Observation has a reference to Patient. But in the GraphDef one needs to define that a #1 'Patient SHALL have 3 Observations'. (and not: the Observation shall have references to 3 Patients). We could have the requirement (#2) "Observation shall have a 1..1 reference to Patient". To me #1 is best taken care of in an edge directed from patient to Observation (the current GrapDef has a 'reverse' indicator and a FHIRPath based on the target node), and #2 in an edge directed from Observation to Patient.</p>

<p>Reverse relationships are already covered by the current GraphDef (I think). link.target.params "criteria for reverse lookup". <br>
What Michel and I are advocating is an overhaul of GraphDef, not just adding some tweaks to it. Before a proposal can be made some aspects have to be discussed first, to ensure the new approach (defining a GraphDef as a collection of nodes and edges) will indeed work.</p>

<p>See image for proposed new structure. The old GraphDef allowed for one single profile per node, this version allows for multiple profiles on a node. This obviously complicates matters significantly. Question is whether we need to support multiple profiles. IMHO if a node conforms to two profiles, where one is not a specialization of the other, then we'd need to support multiple profiles on a node.</p>

<p>? nodes may have heaps of edges, sometimes an edge corresponding to a slice in a strucdef. You may be tempted to use a structure like  n * ( node, all-edges-which-have-node-as-source ). That's mappable to graphML, the source of an edge need however not be the source of a reference, so the above grouping/ tree like structure will then seem rather arbitrary to some. Needs more discussion anyway.. my approach was to follow a cross-industry standard like GraphML.</p>

<p>basically, yes. The only problem being that an edge is a "requirement (as defined by the source of the edge) when it comes to a reference OR a reverse reference".  Let's say a Pat resource is required to have 3 Obs resources. The reference is from Obs to Pat, but the requirement (the edge) as defined from Pat to Obs has (sourceNode=Pat, targetNode=Obs, link.min=3 and link.max=3 link.reversePath=true link.path=patient). There is also an edge from Obs to Path to express that an Obs shall have exactly one Pat subject (sourceNode=Obs, targetNode=Pat, link.min=1 and link.max=1 link.reversePath=false link.path=patient). The latter requirement is probably also expressed either in the core models or in a profile on Obs (node.profile).</p>

<p>Ta. I’m wondering if reverse edges are needed, Obs[3..3] to node patient[1..1] via path=node. <br>
Is clear, the list of nodes reflect bundle entries and relationships in the bundle.<br>
(I believe I can generate graphML (and so a graph), tabular version of graphdefinition and a Skelton bundle. Which is helping a developer several ways)</p>

<p>Dunno, if we throw slicename into the mix (which may be different depending on the direction of the requirement) it gets hairy pretty soon. I'm not saying collapsing a ref and a reverse-ref into one structure won't work, but it's an optimalization which can perhaps be added later. Right now I'm waiting on feedback from this proposal as it will be presented at DevDays, let's take it from there..</p>

<p>I addition to cardinality I  am wondering if we need to provide conformance expectations for each node or edge.  namely to say RE in v2 speak.   Right now have 1..1 = R,  0..1 = O or ?.   0..1 +  MustSupport flag (or extension) would seem like a logical choice to me.  there is already a rule element for compartment but I frankly don't understand the compartment bit and ignore it.</p>

<p>We probably don't want to replicate anything which is already there in StrucDef (for nodes). But I could imagine a mustSupport type of flag on the edges.  As for the compartment bit: this allows one to ensure that e.g. there's just one single patient resource instance in a graph. In my proposed structure we deal with that challenge in a different way - a more flexible way, but also less elegant way. Using compartments doesn't scale, it only solves a small subset of the problem space.</p>

<p>I don't think you can create a v2-like diagram of a FHIR message because FHIR intrinsically allows you to link to the same resource from many places and there's no intrinsic ordering to the list of resources.  While you could theoretically constrain out those things, it'd be very bad practice to do so.  (You're not supposed to impose order constraints where order has no meaning and prohibiting re-use is going to force exposing the same instances with different URLs which would be confusing to most systems.)</p>
<p>One of the challenges is you can't necessarily know what profiles a given instance will be validated against.  If practitioners get validated against profile p1 when referenced as an encounter admitter, p2 when validated against an encounter dischargers and p3 when validated against an order author, you may have some messages where the same practitioner is pointed to by all 3 places and must be valid against all 3 profiles.  In other messages, there'll be distinct practitioners for each.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for the newly proposed GraphDef is a requirement to have nodeIds. The current R4 GraphDef uses the 'profile name' as a unique identifier for a node, but given there can be multiple nodes that claim conformance to the same profile that won't work other than in some simple use cases. <br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191687">@Kevin Mayfield</span> as for profiling sub-parts (e.g. a section) of a resource: that's a much wider ranging/separate methodology issue. StrucDefs are currently associated with the resource level.</p>

<p>So basically you only have links, where path indicates the 'from', and target the type-of-destination. I don't see any id's in your example. If multiple links have the same node as theird efintion, with the same structureDefinitions applied to it, then how would you accomplish this? Your solution will probably work for composition, which is a tree-like structure and not a fully interconnected graph.</p>

<p>In the R4 GraphDefinition resource, one can (loosely reworded) define that an instance-constraint applies, some  "edge/reference" references have to point to the same/different resource instance. 4 options were listed in R4 to state the relationship between the instances referenced by two different references, they can be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identical: have the same literal reference</li>
<li>Matching: be about the ‘same thing’, but the reference may be different</li>
<li>Different: be different</li>
<li>Custom: comply with a FHIRPath expression</li>

<p>as for your Composition problem: one can define a Composition node which has a StrutDef defined for it which only constraints the non-section-parts of a composition, and another Composition node which e.g. has a strucDef which only covers the AdmissionDetails section.  Currently we have to have a reference between the two, so even though GraphDef is a 'type graph' we can't really specify that these two Compsition nodes need to be implemented as one single Composition resource. <br>
As long as FHIR deals with strucdefs solely at the resource level I don't think we should even attempt to create a 'workaround' in GraphDef.</p>

We use a graph of type definitions (aka nodes) to describe a graph of instances (aka resources).</p>
<p>node.minInstances/node.maxInstances : the resulting instance graph SHALL have between minInstances and maxInstances instantiations of this node (thus allowing one to state that there must be 2 different patient resources, or 2 different encounter resources, or that there shall be a max of 1 patient resource).</p>
<p>node.must-support : StrucDefs allow for must-support on OUTBOUND references. If you want to state that a "Patient resource shall have 3 INBOUND references from Observation resources" then node.mustSupport allows you to flag that inbound reference. StrucDoc doesn't allow you to do this.</p>
<p>node.profile is 1..* - * becasue it could comply with multiple profiles. 1 because we need at least a base/core profile (resource type, even if that's as basic as the Resource resource type to represent ANY). Node is a type definition, so we'd need at least one profile.</p>
<p>edge.equalTarget - edge is a type definition of a reference. If A has a ref (ref1) to B, and C has a ref (ref2) to B, how does one state that 'both instances of B' have to be one and the same instance, if node.minInstances is &gt; 1 ?  ref1 has the same 'target' as ref2. "ref1.equalTarget = ref2"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>need to more graph in MessageDefinition to focus node, not message<br>
Could you elaborate?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does this fit with compartments? No idea - I've never understood their use (and I've tried) beyond certain academic access control scenarios. My starting point for the proposal were discussions around common use cases, not on copying all of the functionalities of compartments.If all of the above can be accomplished with compartments then by all means, bring it on. But also make sure it'll work for any compartments, also compartments based on logical models, e.g. an expression of CDA in FHIR, or Dutch ZIBs in FHIR.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>we could really see why mininstance/maxinstances for the whole set - as opposed to on the edges - made sense. where's a use case where you'd use it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>must-support - I think you mean, must-exist then? But isn't that min/max on the edge? if not, how is it different</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do you need the base profile if you have another profile do you? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I guess that explained equalTarget, but it's still not clear what equal source has to be - isn't the source the source?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the message definition can have multiple focus nodes. each focus has it's own graph, so graph needs to be on focus rather than the definition as a whole</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>compartments don't do any of the stuff you did, they do something else. It's fundamental: I want to retrieve all the stuff, but I want to make sure it all references the same patient or encounter and doesn't cross into others - and if it does, I want you to ignore the links or raise an error. We don't have conpartments in logical models</p>

<ul>
<li>mininstance/maxinstances: e.g. for wishing to make sure there's only one single encounter resource, or patient resource. Probably similar to what what you'd do using compartments. But compartments don't allow you to specify that there shall be 2 patients (e.g. mother/child observations), right?</li>
<li>must-support, as in <a href="https://build.fhir.org/profiling.html#mustsupport" target="_blank" title="https://build.fhir.org/profiling.html#mustsupport">https://build.fhir.org/profiling.html#mustsupport</a> , i.e. not a cardinality, but a conformace type statement on inbound references, given that one cant declate must support for inbound references anywhere else</li>
<li>no need for base if one has a derived profile. </li>
<li>equalSource: sometimes you'd like to make a statement about the source of an edge (edge = reference, or reverse reference) being the same instance as the source of some other edge. Just being able to make statements about equalTargets won't be sufficient.</li>
<li>agree that each focus in a message would be its own graph, although I'd actually like to have GraphDefs without a rootnode anyway. Don't need a root when one has a graph. All focus references could be to one and the same graph. But as long as we have a root node,  we'd need multiple (overlapping/overlaying) GrahpDefs to describe a message (which is juck, both conceptually as from an implementation perspective). I tried to stay away from having to define subgraphs and joining graphs, but as long as messages are allowed to have multiple different focus types, and GraphDefs have a rootnode, we're stuck.</li>

<p>I look at must support as way to say the edge isn's optional as <code>0..1</code> may suggest to an implementer, but is a requirement if the target node exists in their system.</p>

<ul>
<li>If we don't have a rootNode on a Graph then the validator will have to be smart enough to somehow match the type-graph to the instance-graph (which need not have a rootNode either). So it's (a lot harder) for a validator.</li>
<li>regarding messsage: if we have a Graph starting at MessageHeader, there'd be no need for subGraphs (for multiple focus resources). Node currently references a cononical(StrucDef), but we could extend that to be canonical (GraphDef) so at least we'd be able to define some node to be equal to a rootNode in another Graph.</li>
<li>Compartments: as I understand the situation Compartments are trying to do a different thing then what I'm trying to do in my proposal, with some area of overlap. Question is then: can/should compartments be enhanced to support of of the functionality (is that within scope for compartments), or are we talking about something similar yet different? And yes, I'd like any solution also to work with logical models.</li>

<p>I saw the GraphDefinition XML profile. The attributes do make an edge connection between nodes, but how will you run traversals and operations without a stack or array object to encapsulate the traversals? I mean I guess if the XML/JSON is created in order of the graph's traversal you can parse portions of it from top to bottom, which leads to the question how will the traversals take place in the XML? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191687">@Kevin Mayfield</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191372">@René Spronk</span>.</p>

<p>There might not be choice in certain situations about conforming to orthogonal profiles, e.g., jurisdictionally required profiles (such as US Core) for a resource, where an IG might impose other, non-jurisdictionally required constraints.  On the other hand, it's easy enough to create profile C which has all the requirements of profile A and profile B.  Having multiple profile support in GraphDefinition isn't an absolute requirement to support multiple profile conformance.  Honestly, I think it depends on tooling support.  If there's appropriate tooling to combine constraints from multiple profiles and apply them at once, this is technically feasible.  Existing tools (e.g., validation) can be used to test for multiple profiles.  So I don't see adding multiple profiles to graph definition as being that much more complexity, and I do see cases where it might be required to ensure conformance to jurisdictional constraints in addition to IG constraints (to localize an IG to a jurisdiction).</p>
