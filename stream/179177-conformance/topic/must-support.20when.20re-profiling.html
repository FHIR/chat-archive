<p>I am currently working on a IG and want to base it IPS. Accordingly, I would base most of the profiles on the IPS profiles, i.e. do re-profiling. Now suppose I mark further elements as must-support in one of my profiles. Then profiles may contain must-support elements originating from both IPS and from my IG. However, my own IG might have a different definition of what must-support means than IPS. So the question is: which definition holds for the must-support elements in my profiles?</p>
<p>I would suppose the answer is my definition, i.e. that the definition in the IG now applies to all must-support flags, regardless of origin. But is that actually captured anywhere in the spec? And is there an (informal) expectation that must-support definitions in derived IG can somehow not be less restrictive than the underlying definition (similar to how profiling cannot loosen cardinalities)? It may be a bit theoretical, but I am wondering if it could still lead to issues if one introduces an extremely weak definition of must-support in the derived IG, causing systems to handle the data in ways that are not permissible per IPS.</p>

<p>'Direction' might have made sense in v2 when there was a presumption of only 2 exchange partners (sender and receiver), but that's not a safe assumption in the FHIR space.  While there is the notion of 'client systems' and 'server systems', one can't presume that the expectations for all clients will always be the same, or event that all server expectations will be the same.  For example, you might have clients that are decision support systems and other clients that are rendering apps.  If an IG defines expectations for both, the notion of 'direction' won't help.  The way 'direction' is handled in FHIR, when it's relevant (i.e. different expectations for different systems in an exchange) is by having distinct profiles for each type of participant system.  This approach is necessary because it's not just mustSupport expectations that might vary by system type - cardinality, invariants and even just descriptive guidance might all vary depending on the type of system.</p>
<p>As discussed previously, the notion of 'expected data' also doesn't make much sense in FHIR.  FHIR has no concept of 'null'.  Simple elements can have a value or not.  And they can have extensions or not.  They must have at least an extension or a value.  However, extensions don't necessarily indicate null.  The extension might be a reference, might be text, might be an alternate encoding, might be a formula, or might be a whole lot of other things.  So there's no simple boolean flag that can be used to talk about 'expected data'.  And even if there were, it wouldn't be handled as part of mustSupport because mustSupport doesn't deal with the types of value present - that's not its scope.</p>
<p>The <em>only</em> aspect of mustSupport that could potentially be coded is 'functionality' - i.e. is the expectation the element must be captured in a UI, displayed in a UI, retained in persistent store, transmitted to downstream systems, considered as part of decision support logic, etc.  If this was captured via code, it would need to be 0..* because multiple functions could be required.  It would also have to be extensible because there's no chance we could ever come up with standard codes covering all possibilities.  The question then would be "what's the benefit of having this information exposed in computable form" (as opposed to text, which is what we expect now).  This far, I haven't heard an answer to that question.</p>

<p>I know that there is no null flavor in FHIR. But in each IG there is a specific extension that is used for that purpose. And it is not boolean but a Codesystem to express that. I would also expect that is refined in each IG individually so that it can be adapted to formalize the needs.</p>

<p>It's not a question of creator/consumer.  You might have two different consumers with different mustSupport rules.  So the way you describe it is a separate profile for each participant - if the rules are different depending on participant type.

<p>In each IG there IS NOT a specific extension that is used for that purpose.  Some don't list any extensions, some might list one, some might list more than one.  Even if not listed, in most cases implementers are free to make up their own extensions and use those too instead/in addition.</p>

<p>For that reason they should be combined , if necessary.<br>
Depending on the Codesystem for referring to Extensions that can be adapted. It is not defined per se, but allows to formalize what is described in an IG. It is replacing natural language sentences into codes.<br>

<p>The idea behind those extensions is to translate the natural language requirements into something that is computable. As a first step, the IG should drive the codes. In a subsequent step the instances should be analysed whether we can find commonalities. Probably it is not explained good enough so far.</p>

<p>They can't (and won't) be combined.  'null' is not a special concept in FHIR.  There's "has a value" and "doesn't have a value".  "Doesn't have a value" can cover numerous possibilities.  There is no notion of 'null'.   And there is no chance of all IGs having a common approach to what extensions are allowed.</p>

<p>I have never said that there is a null flavor. On the contrary, but there is a recognition that something comparable is necessary. As you said, this is the reason why IG writers have designed a special extension for that. This named differently. It may cover different values. And there may be more than in a single IG.<br>
May proposal should use a Codesystem to identify that. Therefore it can and most probably will be different in every IG. Is this a problem - no.<br>
But such an individual Codesystem would identify all natural language requirements.<br>
One can use that alone or combined with others. Just as necessary.</p>

<p>The comparable thing to v2's notion of 'null' is PATCH - that allows you to say "changing some things, but not other things".  There is <em>no</em> way to do that in a regular FHIR Update (and, at this point, it's safe to say there won't be).  The notion of 'null' in v3 is different in FHIR too - and there's no intention to ever have anything directly the same.  IG authors create extensions for all sorts of things - and they don't necessarily neatly overlap with v3's notion of 'Null flavor'.</p>
<p>In any event, the notion of 'null flavor' <em>does not belong</em> in MustSupport - it's a different concept and is orthogonal.  You could place constraints on what extensions are allowed for elements that don't need to be supported; and you can have elements that are silent on the use of 'null-like' extensions but are marked as mustSupport.</p>
<p>So combining the notions of 'what must be supported' vs. 'are null-like extensions allowed' vs. 'who do these rules apply to' is simply not appropriate.  In FHIR, "Who do these rules apply to" is covered by the CapabilityStatement.  If the rules are the same for multiple participants, they'll all point to the same profile.  If the rules differ for different participants, then each participant will have it's own profile - and those profiles will have different values for mustSupport, cardinality, invariants, descriptions and any other elements in the profile.</p>
<p>Replacing natural language with computable content is not something that "must be possible".  It's something we <em>could</em> choose to do.  But it's only something we should choose to do if there are clear use-cases for what could be done computably with a statement of "must display" vs. "must store" vs. "must allow capture on data entry", etc.  You haven't shared that yet.</p>
<p>Note that saying xyz and abc are the only extensions allowed is, generally, really bad practice.  It interferes with re-use as well as future evolution  and generally increases costs for the community.</p>

<p>In IHE we use Must-Support like we have used "R2" or "RE" in the past. Required If known, but not mandatory. Used to force populating an element when the data are available, but recognizing that many times the data are not available.   The problem we have run into is that a Profile derived off a minimal Profile, where the minimal Profile used Must-Support widely, the derived profile that has stricter mandatory elements ends up with an element marked both Must-Support and Mandatory. This is a conflict as an element can't logically be both mandatory and required if known. One solution would be to allow the Must-Support flag to be removed when the minimal cardinality is increased. As it stands today that is not possible (unless I don't know a trick) . So the best I can do is to define Must-Support in a more complex way, indicating that Must-Support means nothing when minimal cardinality is not zero but otherwise means required if known (R2).</p>

<p>mustSupport + mandatory are not conflicts.  It's possible to be mandatory with mustSupport=false.  I.e. "There has to be a value here, but it's fine if you send a hard-coded fixed value, don't store it, don't expose it on your UIs and don't pay any attention to it."  If that's not your expectation for a mandatory element, then you need 'required' too.  Mandatory, by itself, is not enough.</p>

<p>You can't redefine mustSupport in that way.  mustSupport <em>can't</em> reflect anything about cardinality in the instance.  It can only reflect what system is expected to do with the element (display, capture, store, consider in logic, etc.).  If you have a concept that integrates notions of both "what must be supported" and "what must be sent", then in FHIR, that'll have to be represented as two distinct elements.</p>

<p>Population is governed by cardinality and invariants alone.   The <a href="https://build.fhir.org/profiling.html#mustsupport">profiling page</a> makes clear that mustSupport is separate from cardinality.</p>
<p>If you want data to be populated if it exists, mark it as mustSupport=true.  If you want it to be fully optional mark it as mustSupport=false.  If the element is mandatory, you still need mustSupport if you want the system to actually 'support' the element and, as a sender, not just hardcode a fixed value or, as a receiver, completely ignore the element.  (That's what it means if the element is mandatory and mustSupport=false - there's no requirement to 'support' the element as a receiver at all, and the only support required of a sender is to ensure a value is there - even if there's no slot in any data base, UI, or anything else for it.)</p>

Is it a requirement to derive from the profile with the MustSupport flags? If not, could you copy-paste the differential and then delete the MustSupports you don't need? </p>
<p>And I agree with you about MustSupport flags. The spec says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Labeling an element MustSupport means that implementations that produce or consume resources SHALL provide "support" for the element in some meaningful way. Because the base FHIR specification is intended to be independent of any particular implementation context, no elements are flagged as mustSupport=true as part of the base specification. This flag is intended for use in profiles that have a defined implementation context.</p>
<p>For this reason, the specification itself never labels any elements as MustSupport. This is done in StructureDefinitions, where the profile labels an element as mustSupport=true. When a profile does this, it SHALL also make clear exactly what kind of "support" is required, as this could involve expectations around what a system must store, display, allow data capture of, include in decision logic, pass on to other data consumers, etc. </p>

<p>This is what we've done on the Canadian IPS variant--the actual IPS MS flags are too restrictive, so rather than derived profile of IPS, we've developed parallel profiles that let you conform to IPS but don't require it.</p>
<p>As for R2 or required-if-known, we've made or left elements optional (min cardinality 0), flagged them as MS, and made the definition of MS "senders shall populate if they have a value".</p>
<p>I'm a little confused about how to apply the MS definitions of a parent IG to elements that I flag as MS in my IG, and how my definition of MS applies to elements in parent IGs, but I think that's mostly a separate issue from how to indicate R2.</p>

<p>You can make the definition of mustSupport conditional on cardinality if you like.  You can say that mustSupport says "must be capable of sending and must transmit if known (and consent and other business rules permit)".  If an element is mandatory, then that automatically means the 'if' must be true.</p>

<p>Cardinality, by itself, has no meaning around mustSupport other than "must be a value on the wire".  You <em>can't</em> enforce that it has meaning other than that.  We specifically split off all meaning around "what systems must do" behavior-wise into the mustSupport element.</p>

<p>If the purpose of a profile is defined as "what must be persisted", then I guess mandatory would apply to that.

<p>IGs can do all sorts of things.  They can say "every element whose name starts with an 'a' or 'q' must be persisted in its own relational database table" if they really want to.  But in terms of using elements as they're defined to be used, "cardinality" is about "must this element be present in the instance" and "mustSupport" is about "what is the system expected to do with respect to the capture, display, storage, use, re-transmission, etc. of the element".  An element being mandatory in the core spec sets <em>no</em> expectations around capture/display/storage/use/etc.  Interpreting cardinality to mean things that are meant to be communicated by mustSupport is going to cause grief - especially when it comes to dealing with HL7 core elements that are mandatory and with the ability to leverage profiles defined by others.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>&quot;Something useful&quot; is context dependent and impossible to describe in the base FHIR specification. For this reason, tue mustSupport flag is never set to true by the FHIR specification itself - it is only set to true in profiles. A profile on a type can always make musSupport = true if it is false in the base type but cannot make mustSupport = false if it is true in the base type. This is done in Resource Profiles, where the profile labels an element as mustSupport=true. When a profile does this, it SHALL also make clear exactly what kind of &quot;support&quot; is required, as this can mean many things. Note that an element that has the property IsModifier is not necessarily a &quot;key&quot; element (e.g. one of the important elements to make use of the resource), nor is it automatically mustSupport - however both of these things are more likely to be true for IsModifier elements than for other elements.

<p>I will try one more time. For example in MHD I have a profile on DocumentReference for "minimal" metadata, it has many elements as optional, but they are marked with MustSupport. Where MustSupport is "required if known". I then have a "comprehensive" profile that is derived off of that minimal metadata and  changes some elements to mandatory (for example, because XDS requires them). These elements happen to have been MustSupport in the minimal metadata profile that this comprehensive profile is derived off of. Thus the comprehensive profile has some elements that are cardionality 0.. with MustSupport (no problem), but also some elements that have cardionality 1.. with MustSupport. It is these second category that are manditory because of the comprhensive profile, but still have MustSupport from the minimal metadata profile.</p>

<li>One solution is to define MustSupport as "Please ignore MustSupport if the element is cardionality 1.., otherwise the indicated element must be populated if the sender knows a data value for the element".  I can define MustSupport this way, it is just really messed up.</li>
<li>I could just NOT derive comprehensive DocumentReference off of minimal DocumentReference. but this sure makes keeping everything nicely defined and aligned harder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just seems to me that decades of experience by HL7, DICOM, and IHE to use "Required if Known", would have something like it ready for use in FHIR. I thought that MustSupport could be that.</p>

<p>so I just don't see at all what needs solving. You seem to think it's somehow bad to say that the minimum cardinality is 1, and that it's also must support. Why?</p>

<p>I don't see a problem with deriving the comprehensive profile from the minimal one. The minimal one says send these elements if you have them; the comprehensive says you'd better have content for some of those if you want to send it.</p>

<p>"Some elements marked as must-support have a minimum cardinality of 1, so that they must be sent. This combination indicates that other variants of the same profile, they are marked as RE, but this label in addition to a minimum cardinality of 1 makes it explicitly clear that the value in the element SHALL come from a stored value, not some aribitrarily added fixed value to meet the cardinality requirements"</p>

<p>but how many others really need R2/RE... just want this on the stack of iprovement opportunities for next generation beyond mustsupport</p>

<p>because I have absolutely seen engineers hack fixed values into minimum cardinality elements, and then claim that there's nothing to say that they can't. Clinical Safety be damned.</p>

<p>As an example, I have some profiles where I'll have min=1, mustSupport=false on MedicationRequest.intent.  The context is "this is always a prescription, it must always be a prescription".  Therefore, it's totally fine if the system can't capture, display, store, or do anything useful with MedicationRequest.intent.  Profile sets a fixed value for it.  All the normal rules that go with "mustSupport" don't apply to that element.  So it's meaningful to say mustSupport=false there.  However, MedicationRequest.medication is also 1..1.  And that's definitely mustSupport=true.  Which means there are expectations around actually supporting the concept in their system, letting users capture it, see it, etc.</p>

<p>I get that your definition of MustSupport fits you well.. and overall I  like it... but I need R2/RE concept, and your MustSupport does not help with that need.</p>

<p>It works just fine.  "must send if have" works fine with "must have".  If you've got no requirements about display, capture, store - so be it.</p>

<p>Right, MS and 1..1, and the presence of that code is what identifies the resource as meeting the  BP  profile, so it makes perfect sense to have it both hard-coded and MS.</p>

<p>Better to say "need not be processed" as "may not be processed" is the form of a command to not process</p>
