<p><a href="http://build.fhir.org/compartmentdefinition.html#bnr" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/compartmentdefinition.html#bnr">http://build.fhir.org/compartmentdefinition.html#bnr</a> states:<br>
"The practitioner compartment includes any resources where the resource is explicitly linked to a Practitioner (usually as author, but other kinds of linkage exist)"<br>
For Practitioner, unlike the other compartments defined, there is PractitionerRole as an indirect way to link a Resource instance to a certain Practitioner. So, logically, every Resource instance that refers to a PractitionerRole of Practitioner X would belong to the Practitioner compartment instance X. This becomes more important, since PractionerRole itself becomes more important from R4.</p>
<p>So either indirect references/links via PractitionerRole should be included in the above text and in the Practitioner CompartmentDefinition.</p>
<p>Or, if there are reasons to not include that type of linkage, it should at least be explicitly stated that these indirect links are not included, maybe also on <a href="http://build.fhir.org/compartmentdefinition-practitioner.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/compartmentdefinition-practitioner.html">http://build.fhir.org/compartmentdefinition-practitioner.html</a> .</p>
<p>I don't know if that has been discussed before, just came across that and didn't find any info.</p>

<p>In short:<br>
Should every resource instance that refers to a PractitionerRole that is contained in the Practitioner's compartment instance also be contained in that compartment instance?</p>

<p>i think that's what that's saying.  I know my server doesn't do that...</p>

<p>I think, that's what it's meaning, but it should be stated explicitely.<br>
Should I create a tracker item for that?</p>
