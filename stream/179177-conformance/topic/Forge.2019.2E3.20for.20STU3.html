<p>I installed 19.3 but there appears to be a lot of garbage leftover from the old version 16.x. How do I get rid of that? There is no uninstall option for Forge.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192228">@Brian Reinhold</span>, you can uninstall Forge via Windows Control Panel, Programs and Features.</p>

<p>Michel, <br>
That is what I had hoped. I see version 19.3 in the control panel. but not the old 16.3 (it was 16.x, not sure what it was). However, there are lots of files leftover from the November 2017 install date. For a while I had windows open for both versions (after I unstalled 19.3) but I closed the old one.</p>
<p>So if I uninstall, I will just uninstall 19.3</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could clean up old installation folders manually. The Options menu provides a command "Open Application Folder" that will open the install folder in Windows Explorer. Don't delete the opened folder itself, as this represents the latest version. However you might also see one or more sibling folders that contain older (obsolete) Forge versions. You can then safely delete those folders.</p>

<p>When I do this I see 11 folders dated today (the date of install 19.3). I see 11 more folders dated 18/8/2017 and two folders dated 24/11/2017. So I assume I can safely delete all 11 folders not dated today?</p>
<p>Actually I tried and I got a message I could not because they were being used by the system. Not sure why; one that gave me this message was an old forg..tion_30cf8f29be5d8a3f_0010.0005_e53d7991a5e076d1 folder.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192228">@Brian Reinhold</span>, the installation folders are created by ClickOnce in a deeply nested folder structure below %APPDATA%, with long and cryptic folder names. Usually, Forge installation folders will have a name that starts with "forg". You'd have to inspect the contents of the individual folders to determine which application and version they contain, e.g. by opening forge.exe file properties or readme.txt. If Windows prevents you from deleting a folder because files are in use, then that folder probably contains the currently running application version, and you should maintain/restore the folder contents.</p>
