<p>For educational purposes, when looking at slicing, I'd like to distinguish between "simple slicing" (the 80% use case, the common/simple use cases) and "complex slicing" (advanced slicing). What in your mind would be things that would fall into the "simple slicing" category?</p>
<p>(a bit of background: I'm working with Firely to produce some metrics derives from the Profiles in <a href="http://Simplifier.net" target="_blank" title="http://Simplifier.net">Simplifier.net</a>, to see what conformance options are actually being used - which will influence how much time we spend on these topics during our FHIR training courses. No need to talk in any detail about advanced stuff if it's almost never used. We don't have detailed metrics yet, we'll share whatever comes out of it).</p>

<p>Though in practice, I'd actually like to see most slicing done by pattern rather than by value because that's safer/smarter</p>

<p>Simple slicing = slicing by value with a single discriminator and fixed values with open slicing.  Complex slicing = multiple discriminators, slicing by anything other than value, slicing by value with value set,s closed or ordered slicing, constraining or re-slicing existing slices</p>
