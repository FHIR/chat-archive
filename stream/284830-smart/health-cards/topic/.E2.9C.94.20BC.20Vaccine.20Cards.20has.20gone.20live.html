<p>Someone on Twitter has advised me the QR scan starts with 'shc:/', so that's some good news.</p>

<p>Yes... it is SHC.. you can use it with SHC framework however public keys and issuers are yet not part of VCI directory and due to which FHIR bundle is not responding with all the fields of user however you can decode JWS response to read the fields values and normalize it to FHIR bundle. It will take little time for Canada to get all issuers listed under VCI directory until then you can at least know the date of vaccination &amp; vaccination status of an individual.</p>
