<p>There's no documentation around expectations for what includeIdentityClaim values are valid?</p>

<p>We don't really have any experience with this feature; didn't want to over specify -- I think currently they're really just hints for a server. Interesting questions include: should there be a way to request existing elements but "blurred" like a birth month instead of date, or initials instead of a name. Would love to see issuers experiment with this kind of thing; right now other than the demo <a href="http://c19.cards">c19.cards</a> I'm not sure any issuers support this "includeIdentityClaim" feature in any capacity.</p>

<p>Is there additional conversation about the intent of includeIdentityClaim elsewhere (this topic is definitely a great start)? Following/I'd like to link to this topic and to where this is mentioned in the <a href="https://spec.smarthealth.cards/">SHC spec</a> from the FAST Identity project page for continued discussion, since it sounds relevant to identity and matching...</p>

<p>Beyond here + GitHub, nothing I'm aware of</p>
