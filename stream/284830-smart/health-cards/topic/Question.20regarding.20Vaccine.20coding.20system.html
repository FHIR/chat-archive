<p>Hi All. I need a bit of help with the Immunization coding system. I'am not sure what coding system do I need to use for Vaccines which are not included into CVX coding system.  I can see that GTIN (<a href="https://www.gs1.org/gtin">https://www.gs1.org/gtin</a>) is also supported as coding system but I'm not able to find any code for either "Sputnik V", "Astra Zeneka" and Chinese "Sinopharm/Sinovac".  We are currently located in N. Macedonia in Europe. I would appreciate any information you may give.</p>

<p>Hello <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="413223">Hristijan Curukoski</span>  -- to add to what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194174">@Paul Denning</span> said above, the answer depends on what terminology is available for you.</p>
<p>The GTIN can be found on the physical packaging for many vaccines, but may not be on some (not sure about Sputnik or Sinovac). Some places like the US and UK have a centralized way to determine the GTIN for a given vaccine, but this may not be the case everywhere. So if the system of record for vaccines doesn't already include GTIN, it may not be easy to add support for this without a central database.</p>
<p>SNOMED GPS, ICD-11, or ATC/DDD may also be options, but note that these code systems do not identify the "formulation" of the vaccine (and ATC/DDD doesn't identify anything other than "COVID-19 vaccine"). So if you use one of these code systems, you will also have to identify the manufacturer (which for the purposes of COVID-19 vaccines implies the formulation). <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/branches/main/StructureDefinition-vaccination-credential-immunization.html#vaccine-manufacturer">There are two options for doing this</a>: (1) include the GTIN, or (2) separately specify the manufacturer with a GLN.</p>
<p>If none of these options work well for you, please let us know -- if there's a way to extend the IG to support the specifics of your use case, we will try do do so!</p>

<p>I'm not actually sure if GLNs exist for Sputnik and Sinovac -- we wil investigate this further. In the meantime, any additonal information you can give us about how the vaccine is currently identified in your system of record would be helpful.</p>

<p>Just following up on this, it looks like CVX codes have been issued for some additional vaccines <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/COVID-19-related-codes.html">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/COVID-19-related-codes.html</a>. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="322501">@Max Masnick</span> could these be used for Sputnik or Sinovac?</p>

<p>Yes if the description on the CVX code matches the vaccine then they can be used in the CVX slice. I’ll see about getting the terminology server to reflect these updates if it doesn’t yet</p>

<p>I was hoping at some point we could get GLN's for some of the non-US vaccines, but good to see some more added to CVX.</p>
<p>"not counted toward immunity in US" is an interesting note.</p>
