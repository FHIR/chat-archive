<p>Nothing surprising here, but figured I'd share these from my notes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q. How can a verifier be certain that the health information presented belongs to the presenter? How is identity binding achieved and to what level of assurance?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A. Josh Mandel<br>
The answers will vary across different standards, but the most common frameworks use two components: a QR code with signed clinical information and a small set of demographics (typically just name + birthdate), and a "traditional" ID like a driver's license or passport. A verifier needs to cross-check that the demographics in the QR match the traditional ID. This is how SMART Health Cards works, and also how EU Digital Green Certificates work.<br>
Re: level of assurance, this can vary by issuer. In practice, I think quality of identity checks at time of vaccination are highly variable. SMART Health Cards provides a standard flag to indicate "Identity Assurance Level" but in practice most issuers don't achieve higher than LOA1.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q. If QR codes are used to share PII and PHI how is security and privacy maintained? Is this at the cost of interoperability?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A. Josh Mandel<br>
For SMART Health Cards <a href="https://smarthealth.cards/faq.html#privacy">https://smarthealth.cards/faq.html#privacy</a> talks through the approach. There is indeed PII in a SMART Health Card, and it's important that consumers understand exactly what's encoded in a QR like this. Transparency is key; beyond that, we've designed the data set to address the use case of vaccine and lab result verification, focusing on data minimization (e.g., demographics in a QR are limited to those needed to cross-check with an external ID like a driver's license or passport).</p>
