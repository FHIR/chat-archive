<p>I just submitted <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-33728">FHIR-33728</a> so that we can have the discussion about whether to keep lot number designated as must-support.</p>

<p>I support the proposal to remove the lot number, as you've pointed out in the issue it's not of any practical value to a verifier.  I think if there were an issue with a particular lot, it would fall to the local health authority or administering clinic to invalidate that vaccination record when they get in touch with the patient to redo the shot.   The health authority I worked with also indicated that the lot number was inconsistently recorded in their database and so they wouldn't provide the value (suggesting we provide "0" or "N/A" if the value was mandatory).</p>
