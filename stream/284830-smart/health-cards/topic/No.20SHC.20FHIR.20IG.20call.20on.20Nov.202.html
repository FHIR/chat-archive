<p>We are canceling the regular Tues 4pm ET call tomorrow (Nov 2). We went through all the ballot comments and we either have a solid proposed resolution, or we are waiting on more information (either from the commenter, or from the various vaccine terminology people).</p>
<p>If you have something you’d like to discuss with us, please message me and we’ll put it on the agenda for Nov 9.</p>
