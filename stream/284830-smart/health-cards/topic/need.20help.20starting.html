<p>I own/operate a small covid testing company in western Colorado. I am hoping to implement SMART health cards, but need help... is there anyone who can assist me? I do NOT read code and am utterly confused and unsure as to what my first step would be. Anyone?</p>

<p>For DIY I'd recommend reading through the specs if you haven't already:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://spec.smarthealth.cards">SMART Health Cards Framework</a><ul>
<li>Framework for enabling individuals with verifiable health data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://vci.org/ig/vaccination-and-testing">SMART Health Cards: Vaccination &amp; Testing IG</a><ul>
<li>Applies SMART Health Cards to vaccinations and testing, including for COVID-19</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://spec.smarthealth.cards/#what-testing-tools-are-available-to-validate-smart-health-cards-implementations">SMART spec also has links to developer tools</a> to help you get started including example code, libraries for various languages, Jupyter notebook and demo portal walkthroughs, and validation tools.</p>
