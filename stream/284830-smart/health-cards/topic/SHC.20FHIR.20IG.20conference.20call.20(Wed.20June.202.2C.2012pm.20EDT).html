<p>Our every-two-weeks conference call focused on SHR Vaccination &amp; Testing FHIR IG content is <strong>tomorrow</strong>, June 2 at 12pm EDT. <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PHWG/2021-06-02+SHC-VT+Agenda-Minutes">More info here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Agenda:</strong> We will provide an update on our int'l terminology support, and then have a working session on our experimental profiles. These include the vaccination-related adverse event profile that's been in the IG for a while, as well as the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/branches/issue-157/StructureDefinition-infectious-disease-condition-covid-19.html">new profile for represting a past COVID-19 infection</a> that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194164">@Neelima Karipineni</span> has been prototyping.</p>
<p>Some other programming notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a new <code>vaccination@lists.hl7.org</code> listserv under the Public Health WG that we are going to use for communication about the FHIR IG. Our primary channel will still be this Zulip stream, but we will cross-post important messages there and will encourage implementers who are not already on Zulip to join the listserv instead.</li>
<li><a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PHWG/2021-06-16+SHC-VT+Agenda-Minutes?src=contextnavpagetreemode">Our next every-other-week meeting on June 16th</a> will include discussion of the lab results profiles.</li>
</ul>
