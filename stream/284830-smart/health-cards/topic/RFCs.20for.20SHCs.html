<p>We've been having discussion about a few new features for the specification and I created a kind of "holding area" for content that we are considering (and want to get specific about, and want to promote trial implementation of) but are not yet ready/committed to standardize.</p>
<p>So: I added an "rfcs" folder to the main specification repo at <a href="https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/health-cards/tree/main/rfcs">https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/health-cards/tree/main/rfcs</a> (borrowing a bit from practices in the rust community, although over-simplifying the process for now).</p>
<p>This is a process experiment, but if you want to submit new proposals to the specification that we haven't yet decided are in scope, adding content to this folder would be a good way to do it (and you can use <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/0000-template.md">Rust's template</a> as a starting point).</p>
<p>Of course, let me know if you find this structure to be a help or a hindrance.  We are not committed to it!</p>
