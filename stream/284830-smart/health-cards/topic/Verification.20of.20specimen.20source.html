<p>I used our audience with OO to ask about how to handle the method of specimen collection (<a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhir-shc-vaccination-ig/issues/165">https://github.com/HL7/fhir-shc-vaccination-ig/issues/165</a>), meaning one of <code>lab-collect | individual-collect-unobserved | individual-collect-virtual-observed | individual-collect-in-person-observed</code></p>
<p>They thought <code>Observation.component</code> was a reasonable place for this. We would need to find a code for <code>Observation.component[].code</code> to indicate "method of collection", and then figure out the value set for the concepts listed above (create our own, get SNOMED codes, etc.)</p>

<p>I really don't think that this should be called 'method of collection' - that will make any body connected to the process think about venepuncture etc</p>

<p>looks like LOINC doesn't have a code for this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Details about the exact source and collection method (e.g., blood drawn from the right arm and maintained on ice) are not a proper part of the test name</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(and that's not even about this method)</p>

<p>I don't think "verification of specimen source" conveys this idea to me very well, either.</p>

<p>Copy/paste from my comment on the github issue in July -</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>I did a LOINC and SNOMED search and did not find codes that really convey the options above, either single codes or even combinations that could be used together. There isn&#39;t a code that generically represents a patient-performed procedure such as sample collection, and did not find anything close to &#39;observed&#39;, &#39;supervised&#39;, &#39;monitored&#39;, etc.

There are encounter status codes that sort-of represent in-person vs remote encounter, but that was the closest I could find.

<p>This seems sort of like "collection process type" (not that I particularly like that term, either).</p>

<p>FYI, for Urine collection, people generally use the term "Monitored Collection" to mean supervised but not directly visual, generally using audio cues, as opposed to "Direct Observation" which means visually seeing it (either by video or in person)</p>

<p>Since the value set really does seem to be pretty much all about supervision (more so than the "who" aspect), I think that "specimen collection supervision status" should work.</p>

<p>Thanks Rob. It sounds like that’s the winner then.</p>
<p>I believe we are going to attempt to get SNOMED codes rather than coming up with our own bespoke codes.</p>
