<p>Hi. I would like to obtain a Smart Health Card but my state (Massachusetts) is not on the list of states that provide the Smart Health Card. How can I do this? What are the first steps?</p>

<p>MA doesn't yet have state-wide support for SMART Health Cards, but you may be able to get a SMART Health Card from a provider in MA. See <a href="https://vci.org/issuers">https://vci.org/issuers</a> for a list of issuers, to see if there's one where you may have access.</p>

<p>For example, if you have access to a <a href="https://www.mychart.com/covid">MyChart account from any of the following MA-based health Epic systems</a>, that might be a good source:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atrius Health</li>
<li>Boston Medical Center</li>
<li>Harbor Health</li>
<li>Mass General Brigham</li>
<li>NYU Langone</li>
<li>OCHIN</li>
<li>Pediatric Physicians' Organization at Children's</li>
<li>QuadMed</li>
<li>South Boston Community Health Center</li>
<li>South Shore Hospital</li>
<li>UMass Memorial Health Care</li>
</ul>

<p>My PCP at MGH (Mass General Brigham) pulled in the immunization info from the MA IIS, so I can get an SHC from the MGH Patient Gateway (Epic MyChart).</p>
