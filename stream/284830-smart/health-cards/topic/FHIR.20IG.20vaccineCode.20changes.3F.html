<p>Following up on the ongoing discussion of the difficulty of supporting GTIN as a Verifier (due to the lack of a central list of valid GTINs), and more mature COVID-19 vaccine code support in some of the code systems we use, I want to open a discussion on the following proposed changes that would in theory be part of STU1 ballot reconciliation (making <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-33475">FHIR-33475</a> from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191864">@Isaac Vetter</span> persuasive with mod):</p>
<ol>
<li>Creation of a value set that includes codes for identifying COVID-19 vaccines that are sufficiently granular for Verifiers to determine whether the proper dose series was followed, AND have a centrally maintained list of codes that is freely accessible to Verifiers. Currently I believe this includes CVX and AIR, and could potentially include SNOMED as well depending on how "freely accessible" is defined and what codes are in SNOMED GPS. If other code systems meet these criteria, they should be included as well.</li>
<li>Issuers SHALL include at least one code from #1 for all COVID-19 SHCs. (There is a generic CVX code that could be used as a fallback if a more specific code doesn't exist, and if SNOMED is included in #1 then that has generic codes too.)</li>
<li>Verifiers SHALL support interpretation of all codes in #1 that map to vaccines they support in any code system. (So if a Verifier reads CVX#207 for the Moderna vaccine, they would also be expected to read AIR and SNOMED codes that mean "Moderna vaccine".)</li>

<p>I'm interested in feedback on whether or not we should support "supplemental codes" or expect Issuers to only use codes in the value set described above for <code>https://smarthealth.cards#covid19</code> cards. Some thoughts on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>There was some discussion of asking for SNOMED GPS codes that mirror the granularity/scope of CVX's COVID codes. These could be included in the value set described above. If we did this, should we still include the country-specific SNOMED edition codes as part of the value set, only allow these as supplemental codes, or not allow them at all?</li>
<li>The CVX/AIR/SNOMED(?) value set would likely be implemented as a required binding in a slice in a separate COVID-19-specific profile of Immunization. We would still have the generic profile as well, and Issuers could fall back to this if needed (mirroring our approach to lab tests).</li>
<li>I think we want to keep the value set bindings for <code>vaccineCode</code> as <code>required</code> because wallet and verifier apps need to be able to know the full universe of codes they may encounter.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I think that this makes sense. Not sure I'd include AIR on the list though. A code system should only get on the list if it's unencumbered, and there's evidence it's not country specific</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="322501">@Max Masnick</span> I think you're saying that <em>any</em> vocab that met these conditions would be added to our valueset. From an interop perspective: why do we need to include so many? Why not pick one (either an existing one, or or own) instead of accreting synonyms?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> my main goal here was describing why we would pick just CVX and maybe SNOMED (assuming AIR drops out per above), but I agree that we don't necessarily want to keep adding additional code systems that start to meet these criteria.</p>
<p>My main concern with using only CVX is that as far as I know there's not a process for requesting new codes. So I think we would at least need one other code system that supports this and has permissive licensing (e.g., SNOMED GPS).</p>
<p>I think the main arguments against defining our own code system are that we don't have the infrastructure in place to manage regular updates (and CVX/SNOMED do already), and defining a new code system creates implementer burden. So if we did this, the benefits would need to outweigh the burden, and we'd need to figure out how to handle issuing new codes. There may be other concerns I'm missing here too -- I'm not a terminology expert.</p>

<p>Another option would be to use CVX + define our own code system to be used in case a vaccine is missing from CVX (even temporarily). We could then provide mappings from our code system back to CVX. This addresses the implementer burden argument (most are already using CVX as far as I know), and the regular update argument (only needed if implementers identify a code missing from CVX).</p>

<p>Right, I assumed that was part of the input into this topic. requiring a CVX or SCT code and mandating that they are understood would avoid the need for allowing display, but can a rule like that stick? I suspect not.</p>

<p>I agree <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="322501">@Max Masnick</span> ; I think this is worth exploring.

<p>One of the problems with CVX is that the human-readable value we would want for <code>display</code> isn't defined in a consistent place.</p>

<p>And Astrazeneca too! And yes, that's a true but it's not the name it had when you had it, so there's more than one way to look at it. But it would ease our concerns a wee bit if there was an official set of 'consumer friendly names' maintained by CVX. But probably just a wee bit; we need to have the display values from the smart codes be codes that police and bouncers etc immediately recognise as valid vaccines here in Australia.

<p>The Commons Project's Verifier app handles translation of CVX codes into human-readable strings. I recognize that supporting all the code systems currently allowed in an IG is a problem for a Verifier app, but if we downsize the terminology and provide the <code>display</code> values as part of a value set, it would at least be a lot easier.</p>

<p>i18n is another reason why embedding <code>display</code> in the SHC may not make sense -- if Verifiers are going to have to support look-ups to deal with translations from int'l SHCs anyway, they might as well just do it all the time.</p>

<p>so far, that has only english. The base language of the resource is english, so the unadorned display is in english. In addition, the codes all have an Australian consumer friendly display, and also some example UK and NZ terms.</p>
<p>adding other languages etc is a linear extension of this idea</p>

<p>There is a general need for vocabulary display strings for non clinicians. For example the subject of the medical data, the patient. These display strings need just as much translation as the clinician display string.</p>

<p>Packing strings into these payloads we're going to limit our capacity very quickly. Even if we do provide an official set of consumer-facing display names (which I think is a nice idea), I'm concerned about packing these names into our <em>instance data</em>, given the space constraints (and competing pressures like including additional vaccines, relevant durable labs, and probably more to come over time).</p>
<p>If the vocabulary is licensed appropriately, any verifier app can easily maintain an up-to-date set of names (and in a multitude of languages, character sets, etc) and layer them on to the UI in context.</p>
<p>(And context matters -- like, "Moderna" is an ok name if I'm presenting a list of covid vaccines in March 2021, but with brand names, or as Moderna produces new vaccines for other conditions, not so much.)</p>

<p>I think "don't populate <code>display</code>" can be a stronger recommendation if we have that value set with display names.</p>

<p>That's a huge <em>if</em>, and also, I think you and I use the word 'easily' differently. Particularly since it isn't happening now</p>

<p>there's no coherent user experience unless the set of applications that the typical consumer encounters describe the codes coherently. There needs to be a story about how that can happen in the spec. My preferred solution is "provide the correct consumer friendly display for the jurisdiction" and make the rule that 'international apps default to using the provided display unless they know better' (and if one isn't provided, then use look up).</p>

<p>Do we have any examples of consumer-friendly terms from countries who have implemented COVID-19 vaccine credential apps (e.g. NHS)? I'd like to think that we could agree on a common prefix, e.g. "COVID-19 vaccine" that even an Australian nightclub bouncer might understand and then add product/manufacturer names.  If you look at this collection of COVID-19 vaccine codes from around the world, this might be the most feasible approach...<br>

<p>All of this info can be derived from existing CDC IIS standards assets. I don't think we need to be maintaining a separate set.

<p>I'm jumping into this (lively!) discussion a bit late (thanks to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191339">@Pascal Pfiffner</span> for alerting me to it!). This has, indeed, been a struggle for us. I imagine if we're struggling with it, just about anyone else would as well.</p>
<p>I totally see <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>'s point that the only way to ensure absolute consistency in display names across a variety of apps is to use the <code>display</code> name that comes with the record. But as has been pointed out, we can't force any app to do this, and some display names are downright hostile to patients because they were designed for use by providers.</p>
<p>In the Health app, for example, we currently have a hierarchy of Category -&gt; Concept -&gt; Record. We've curated custom, user-friendly "Concept" names such as "COVID-19 Vaccine" or "Flu Vaccine." Within the "COVID-19 Vaccine" Concept room (which is what we call them) you'll find all of the COVID vaccines that we've mapped to that concept via its CVX code. We're currently using the "Sole Proprietary Name" for these COVID vaccines since those seem to be the most user-friendly.</p>
<p>From our POV, having a curated set of (localized?) COVID-19 vaccine names with a permissive license would mostly solve the problem. Apps would gravitate towards using it and you would likely achieve consistency over time simply because it's 1) freely available and 2) high quality (assuming it's actually high quality). The million dollar question is how we actually get to this Nirvana? Perhaps we need to create our own open terminology and call it ERTH (Entire Reference Terminology for Health)? ;)</p>

<p>We’re not taking on a general terminology for this, that’s for sure. No matter how tempting it is for this problem. But we can do a value set that solves this particular problem - i18ned consumer friendly terms for common covid vaccine codes. Logically, it would be a value set next to the vci registry json file, and some group of editors curate the PRs for jurisdictions (I’d be happy to volunteer to admin it at first), with shared responsibility between HL7 and VCI. That’s a location that the clients already trust, and that we could reference from the specification in a “SHOULD” conformance requirement</p>

<p>We are talking to CDC to make sure we're not missing anything re: CVX, but assuming they don't throw up any flags it sounds like...</p>
<p>1) We have general agreement to move forward with a proposal to (1) publish a CVX value set with localized display names; and (2) add a SHOULD conformance requirement to the <a href="http://spec.smarthealth.cards">spec.smarthealth.cards</a> that anytime an SHC is displayed it should be using these display names. <br>
A maintenance/governance plan should be part of this proposal, and can be based on what Grahame said above on this.</p>
<p>2) In a separate-but-related parallel path, we will propose changes to the FHIR IG that reduce the scope of SHALL-support code systems for <code>vaccineCode</code> to only CVX and possibly a small number of other equivalently granular and permissively licensed code systems. The first discussion about this will likely be in Public Health's Q4 session today, and will continue in our upcoming <a href="#narrow/stream/284830-smart.2Fhealth-cards/topic/FHIR.20IG.20ballot.20comment.20reconciliation.20meetings">ballot reconciliation calls</a>.</p>
<p>I believe that all of the above can apply to vaccines for all diseases, but the value set will likely only include robust localization for COVID for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>I wrote the above in definitive-sounding language, but this is really a question to to make sure I got this all correct...if not please propose edits accordingly. Thank you!</p>

<p>We just discussed this on the PHWG Q4 call.</p>
<p>The additions of non-US vaccine CVX codes was a one-off for CDC and it took a lot of time, so they likely can't keep that up to date without somehow getting support from the community.</p>
<p>Everyone agrees that having a small number (one ideally, or two if needed) terminologies that meet the needs for SHCs is critical. We are going to pursue CVX, SNOMED GPS, and ICD-11 as the possible options for this.</p>

<p>Quick update from some internal discussions here at the American Immunization Registry Association on code sets. We are very supportive of trying to find a good common Interational code set that we can use. We are trying to do our own research on ICD-11 and Snomed to see how well these codesets might work, in comparison to what we have in CVX right now. (Because we know CVX, and not because we think it should be the primary standard.)</p>
<p>The only wrinkle in all this, is that our community wants to use VCI beyond Covid. So we are looking at how all vaccine codes will be represented in an international set. We know that Covid is getting all the attention, and we should focus on supporting that first, but there is a larger need for credentials for all immunizations to support school entry, international travel, employment, etc. In our community we are pushing the adoption of VCI, not as just a Covid-specific solution, but as a general solution that will help meet public health goals we've had for decades.</p>
<p>So we are going to look and give our feedback first on Covid and then secondarily what would be the benefit/drawbacks when we expand beyond this. Hopefully I'll have updates for the group on what we find out in the next week after a little investigation and comparison.</p>

<p>Confirmed. I have some interest in helping with this as well, although don't necessarily need direct write access. We have an interest in the vaccination codes for all vaccines, not just covid. We are working to get some initial mappings together between CVX, Snomed, and ICD-11. It will be start, and something that can generate feedback from others. We also have a process for updating CVX codes, we could look to see if we can extend this to automatically propose updates as CVX codes are released. That might be helpful long term.</p>
