<p>We are freezing the list of issues/pull requests that will make it into the stable release of the FHIR IG. If you have a change you would like before the stable release and it's not <a href="https://github.com/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/issues?q=label%3Abefore-1.0+">in this list</a>, please add it with the <code>before-1.0</code> label <strong>before Saturday, May 8</strong>.</p>
<p>Anything that's not on that list before then won't make the stable release. Thanks!!</p>
