<p>Implementers from outside the US: please take a look at <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/branches/vaccine-tx-improvements/StructureDefinition-vaccination-credential-immunization.html">these changes to our Immunization profile</a>.</p>
<p>This adds support for using the following code systems to identify vaccines: GTIN, AIR (Australia), SNOMED-CT (universal; includes SNOMED GPS codes with a more permissive license), ICD-11, and ATC/DDD.</p>
<p>Some of these code systems only identify the vaccine's disease target or the general type of vaccine. In these cases, manufacturer MUST be specified as well. We support using GTIN, GLN (a part of GTIN), or MVX for this. GTIN is the preferred approach.</p>
<p>This also adds LOINC answers for lab test results (in addition to the SNOMED codes we were previously using).</p>
<p><strong>If there are any other code systems you would like to see support for or any other comments, please let us know before our content freeze on Saturday, May 8.</strong></p>
<p>Please leave comemnts on this topic or <a href="https://github.com/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/pull/132">on the GitHub pull request</a>. Thanks!</p>

<p>According to Derick Ritz on IPS Cross-SDO call, GTIN is at the product packaging level, not at the "product" level (e.g. different GTINs for 50 caps, 100 caps and 500 caps of the exact same product).  Is this a concern?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think so. For US GTINs, the product can be extracted by ignoring digits on the right-hand slide of the GTIN, and we're told by GS1 that the GTINs for COVID vaccines are the same everywhere.</p>
<p>Presumbly the product can also be identified by doing some sort of GTIN lookup, though I couldn't figure out how to do this myself with the public lookup tools I found.</p>
<p>I have a list of questions for the GS1 folks, so I added this to that. We'll plan on providing more context on GTIN inside the IG once we talk with GS1.</p>

<p>THO has GTIN <a href="https://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem-gtin.html">https://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem-gtin.html</a> but i don't see GLN there.</p>

<p>In the US, the GTINs for 50 caps, 100 caps, etc. of the same product would just differ by a few trailing digits + the check digit. We will want to confirm this is also true outside the US, but if not I still don't think it's a deal-breaker as long as there's a way to do a lookup on the GTIN.</p>

<p>GLN is just the manufacturer prefix from the GTIN with some padding.</p>

<p>Edited:<br>
<del>Should probably use the NamingSystem for MVX in the identifier.system <a href="https://terminology.hl7.org/NamingSystem-MVX.html">https://terminology.hl7.org/NamingSystem-MVX.html</a> </del></p>
<p>Apparently, the value used for identifier.system is taken from NamingSystem.uniqueId<br>
So for MXV see<br>
<a href="https://terminology.hl7.org/NamingSystem-MVX.json">https://terminology.hl7.org/NamingSystem-MVX.json</a><br>
which has NamingSystem.uniqueId[1].value = <a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/MVX">http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/MVX</a><br>
(which may be wrong, but still following up on that ...)</p>
<p>We should work with UTG/HTA/THO to add GLN as a NamingSystem; they should approve the use of <a href="https://www.gs1.org/gln">https://www.gs1.org/gln</a> (after coordinating with GS1)</p>
