<p>Has anyone discussed what it would mean to produce SHCs for self-performed RAT tests for covid?</p>
<p>if your knee-jerk reaction is 'no way': what kind of record do you think - if any - people should be able to produce?</p>

<p>For observed self performed tests, we've discussed metadata. I think "purely self reported" was one of the options -- <a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhir-shc-vaccination-ig/issues/165#issuecomment-888480678">https://github.com/HL7/fhir-shc-vaccination-ig/issues/165#issuecomment-888480678</a></p>

<p>right. but who would issue a card like that, and what kind of procedures would they need around id verification for the commons project to add them to the directory?</p>

<p>interesting question. i don't think many organizations meeting the current <a href="https://github.com/the-commons-project/vci-directory#types-of-issuers">VCI Directory inclusion criteria</a> would be issuing SHCs for fully self-administered tests.</p>
<p>i know that some current issuers are or are contemplating issuing SHCs for observed self-performed tests via telemedicine visit (per Josh's comment).</p>
<p>i would not be surprised if a pharmacy or lab started issuing SHCs for tests done with self-administered sample collection kits.</p>
<p>i could very much imagine test kit makers with mobile apps wanting to go this route, but we haven't contemplated adding orgs of that type in the directory at this point.</p>

<p>well, I have a query from an importer in Australia who's interested in this - pure retail, wants to provide after-market service, including sharing test outcomes for integration into workflow e.g. entry into a retirement home etc</p>

<p>Actually the validity of any lab test which is consumer performed can be called into question.  Supervision of performance by a health professional helps ensure the specimen is collected from the patient appropriately and not their dog, swabbing their ear, etc.  "Trust" is vital for health professionals who want to stake clinical decision making on consumer performed testing, and why even for a pregnancy test, most providers confirm by a health professional (lab) performed test.  There are medical legal implications too.</p>
