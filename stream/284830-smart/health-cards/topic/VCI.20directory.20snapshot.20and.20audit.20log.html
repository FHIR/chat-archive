<p>I'd like to point out the VCI directory now <a href="https://github.com/the-commons-project/vci-directory/tree/main/logs">produces</a> a daily signed snapshot of the issuer keys and an audit log; see the <a href="https://github.com/the-commons-project/vci-directory/blob/main/logs/README.md">README</a> for details. The snapshot allows applications to validate SHCs in an offline manner.

<p>how it would help? Well, it would be following a standard, vs project defined schema... we are a standards organization, right? so we should use our own standards when they are indicating they are fit for the purpose.  <br>
The exercise might also inform improvements to AuditEvent... we are a standards organization, so should also eat our own dog food.</p>

<p>Are FHIR AuditEvent meant to log interactions with a FHIR server (which is not the case here)? The current audit log reports statistics and analysis on the VCI directory content. I'm not sure I understand how this information fits the AuditEvent <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/auditevent.html#bnc">use cases</a>.</p>

<p>Hello to all that read this.</p>
<p>I am Anthony Gonzalez and my firm, AG Consulting, is attempting to aggregate, to an end to end lab solution for a client, the creation of Smart Health cards with labs results and possibly immunization data as well.  After reading over the available material online that provides an overview and the Smart Health card creation and deployment process (this will be a strictly "print" solution via paper or PDF with QR Code embedded), one of the first steps described is to acquire a VCI for the customers medical practice operation.  In this case, as previously mentioned, a lab testing and immunization clinic.  </p>
<p>I have reviewed much of the available documentation, including the Vaccine Credential Initiative Directory Agreement, and finally I have found the VCI Directory Issuer Request Form in Google Docs.  My firm will be subcontracted to maintain the SHC's on it's own server as part of the working arrangement.  Obviously being a medical bespoke software firm, we ARE NOT the clinic, thus, my question is as follows:</p>
<p>Who fills out the request form, the the lab or the company maintaining the data for the lab?  Who is supposed to register based upon the records and who maintains them?</p>
<p>I need clarification before I send this to my client to confirm which domains need to be listed under the lab's name.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any help.</p>

<p>Re: VCI Directory: The clinic (your customer) is the entity that needs to be registered with the VCI Directory, because they are the entity responsible for making trusted assertions. As a technology provider you can help tor.giode them with submitting the paperwork, but they need to be parties to the agreement.</p>

<p>What do you mean by "not matching"? The card's issuer <code>iss</code> URL does not appear in the VCI directory (which, for CVS, should be "<a href="https://api.cvshealth.com/smarthealth/v1/card">https://api.cvshealth.com/smarthealth/v1/card</a>")? Or does the signature fail? You can try the test <a href="https://demo-portals.smarthealth.cards/VerifierPortal.html">verifier portal</a> to see if there are issues with the card.</p>
