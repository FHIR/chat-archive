</ul>
<p>This is the last RC before our official stable release. We will be accepting bug reports until Friday, May 21 for anything that needs to be fixed before the stable release goes out. We will hold feature requests for a subsequent release unless they are absoltuely critical for our core use case.</p>
<p>There are a number of breaking changes in this release, but most are minor. Please let us know if there are any unexpected or problematic breaking changes (again, by Friday, May 21) -- this is still a RC, so there is still time to put in fixes before the final <code>v0.5.0</code> release.</p>
