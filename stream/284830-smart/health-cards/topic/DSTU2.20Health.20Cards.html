<p>Thus far I've only seen R4 implementations of health cards being done by other vendors.  We are trying to decide if we should add DSTU2 support per vendor request or work with this vendor to use the $health-cards-issue operation via R4.  Is there anything about the health card spec that would make a DSTU2 implementation impractical?  Or would adding this to DSTU2 be straight forward?</p>

<p>Verifiers will not be prepared for parsing dstu2 payloads.</p>

<p>The one thing you might consider is hosting a DSTU2 endpoint for the $health-cards-issue  operation, still retuning Health Cards JWS as output parameters (where the fhirBundle in your JWS is R4, following the VCI IGs)</p>

<p>This is useful if you're trying to support consumer apps that <em>do</em> correctly process (r4) Health Cards but haven't yet integrated with the FHIR r4 rest API. It's a corner case for sure.</p>
<p>Bottom line: strongly recommend sticking to the VCI profiles for the signed content of any Health Cards you issue; distribution of health cards can be more flexible.</p>
