<p>Last week, Cerner released its Health Card APIs to all Millennium EHR clients in the US. Health cards can be requested by consuming apps through standard patient access flows. No additional configuration is required by Cerner clients or developers to use the API. The API also is available for continued testing from our developer sandbox alongside all of Cerner's supported FHIR API endpoints.</p>
<p><a href="http://fhir.cerner.com/millennium/r4/other/health-cards/">http://fhir.cerner.com/millennium/r4/other/health-cards/</a></p>
<p>The API currently supports only Vaccine health cards, but will be enhanced in the coming weeks to support the Testing profile as well.</p>
<p>QR and download workflows will be facilitated by Cerner's patient portal product, HealtheLife. We expect consumer-facing features in the portal to be released near EOM.</p>
