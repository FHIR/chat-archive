<p>Hi all -- we <strong>do not</strong> have the weekly IG meeting this week (would have been on Jan 25). We are pretty close to having resolutions to all the ballot comments, so we will decide this week whether we need to re-start the series going forward -- we may be able to handle the remaining issues more efficiently along with votes on the main PHWG call.</p>
