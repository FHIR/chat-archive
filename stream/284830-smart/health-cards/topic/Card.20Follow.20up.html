<p>Another discovered issue from the Australian connectathon around Lab testing: the lab test omits the DiagnosticReport. That's.. potentially problematic.  Long term, we think it will be necessary to  provide some kind of link in or next to the jwks.json that refers to a service where the issuer may provide some additional services to (a) renew cards and (b) get more information about the cards for authorised users</p>

<p>Worth writing up some use cases here -- very interesting area (and significant complexity, but if labs are willing to invest, we can support with specs).</p>

<p>well, so far, I have two particular cases. One featured very prominently in this weeks podcast of The Dropout (about the fall of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos, which is recommended listening for anyone working in health it and interested in the intersection between business, tech, and health): you never share lab results with a patient with out some context or guidance. mostly, this is left to the doctor who requested the test, but that's not how SHCs work, and so labs will want to - and may have regulatory obligations to - provide the patient with a path for advice / guidance / treatment pathways / etc. As featured in the podcast, in the absence of this, patients often don't seek advice / follow up at all, which is <em>very bad</em> or they decide that they should, but pursue it through the wrong channels (e.g. business sales support for the lab provider).</p>
<p>But this isn't unique to labs. Any provision of a healthcare fact raises the same conceptual issues (though not necessarily the same regulatory requirements).  So any number of workflows beyond lab would benefit from a standard arrangement where the provider published, along with their key, the URL of a service to seek more information about the card. When invoking that service, the client submits the card, and... something happens. </p>
<p>Also, if the card is revoked (this is my second case), then the service can automatically offer a replacement (if they deem it is appropriate). or they can provide further advice as appropriate based on clinical context</p>
<p>For me this is also a sales thing: like branding your SHC, and turning the SHC into a branded channel. Feedback to me (general feedback about APIs, not SHCs) is that this is critical to getting CEO / business buy in to sending SHCs. (See also this card from the Australian connectathon yesterday):</p>

<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/10155/AqqHmpwV4MmjwcGu6sjuk20I/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/10155/AqqHmpwV4MmjwcGu6sjuk20I/image.png"></a></div><p>So I think it would be really useful for the issuer of the card to have a URL with a name, declared at the &lt;&lt;issuer&gt;&gt; that a client would submit the card to, and then... magic would happen. Obviously I haven't worked through that but what follows smells suspiciously look a CDS Hooks kind of thing - one of a number of cards could be returned. The invocation context is kind of different, so CDS Hooks might need some context, but it's pretty much the same thing, right?</p>

<p>I think it would be nicer to define a framework to consume cards (e.g. Trust Registry for Verifiers) as opposed to let the issuer dictate where to go for more information. For instance, a Lab Result should be consumed by a Clinic/Hospital that would not only be liable to have the appropriate understanding of the payload but are also in tune with the latest scientific knowledge and public health policy of the region to provide individualized medical recommendations upon request. Having a fixed URL from the issuer might block use-cases that are outside the purview of that issuer, e.g. multi-jurisdiction use cases. Also, let's try to avoid mixing the lab results are are designed to go straight to consumers (COVID testing, pregnancy test, etc) from the lab results that clinicians request.</p>

<p>Sure. but a lab result that goes to the patient is likely to go to a clinic next. But sure, it's not the same thing. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>how? It doesn't stop the client from doing whatever, it just makes it easy for the client to ask the issuer as well as anything else</p>

<p>It depends on who is the client. if the client is the wallet of the Patient, then it shouldn't be a problem, but if the client is any other verifier, then there is a massive privacy issue. Verifiers should not be allowed to communicate with issuers directly. That's the whole point of verifiable credentials. If they are allowed to ping the issuer then suddenly the payload doesn't even need to be signed anymore.</p>

<p>Agree with Vitor here about the privacy concern. There may be some capabilities that are helpful to advertise, but we definitely do not want to get in the game of enabling back channels between a verifier and issuer <em>for the purpose of verification</em> or <em>with a consequence of trekking individual credential use</em>.</p>

<p>I really don't understand why we would <em>forbid</em> communication. I really don't understand why defining a channel to allow follow up suddenly becomes 'you must follow up' or why you suddenly don't need to verify the payload. </p>
<p>The point of a follow up channel is (a) the user doesn't need to use it and (b) the client only uses it if someone asks to and (c) privacy and security still need to be right on the channel</p>

<p>Because then the individual has a better concept of what is being shared. Specifically: the things they decided to share. </p>
<p>I'm not saying there is no use case for advertising more endpoints and details in an issuer specific way, but this is something we want to be very cautious about.</p>

<p>I don't really understand. If you don't standardise this, then institutions will do one of two things, since the use case is genuine:</p>
<ul>
<li>use something other than SHC that don't have any privacy properties at all</li>
<li>make custom arrangements that happen behind the scenes</li>
</ul>
<p>Better to describe how to do it properly and create conformance expectations about privacy.</p>

<p>At least one of the use cases you mentioned above was about an endpoint for providing information directly to patients. There is no problem with those kinds of patterns. It's something we are starting to explore in our directory metadata, and something that we could easily push into a standardized discovery file if it turns out to be useful.</p>
<p>The concerns are about discovery data that expect and allow for direct communication behind an individual's back.</p>

<p>well, I don't want to expect communication behind an individuals back, but I don't see how you're going to stop allowing it. But if you describe it, you can also describe how to make it require an individuals authorisation, or at least, to ensure that they get a notification if it's used</p>

<p>let's start with the case where the card that's been issued has an expiry date, or the key it was signed with has been revoked. Getting a new one is technically straight forward, but administratively difficult. And particularly in the case of key revocation, likely to be extremely embarrassing - I'm going about my business, some one scans my QR code, and then, bingo, it's not valid. Whoever scanned my code isn't going to think that there's a problem with the infrastructure; they're going to think that I'm lying to them. And most people will just be angry and confused because what happened is nothing to do with them, but their life is disrupted - potentially very severely</p>
<p>To extend this, if I was asked to break the SHC system, this is precisely where I'd try first: if I can entice the issuer into thinking that their key has been compromised, then they'll revoke the key, and suddenly 100k's of users will have invalid SHCs that they are rightly convinced are valid, and keep showing, because they don't have the time or knowledge to go through the adminstrative processes to get themselves a new card. And bingo, trust in the SHC system collapses, and I can present any card I made up and claim that it really is valid, it's not my fault</p>
<p>So I think that a good system to re-issue cards seamlessly is very necessary. And that's the first use case I had. There'd be a link "get a new card" when it's not valid, and upon proper authentication, the user would get a new card (delivered immediately or mailed or emailed or whatever). </p>
<p>so the issuer would have .well-known/links.json:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="JSON"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nt">"re-issue"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">"link"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"http://www.acme.com/shc/re-issue"</span><span class="p">,</span>
   <span class="nt">"name"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"Get a new card"</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And when the card fails, and the holder of the card (assumes that the software understands from it's context that the card it has is on behalf of the user), clicks on/touches "Get a new card", then the software posts the card to <a href="http://www.acme.com/shc/re-issue">http://www.acme.com/shc/re-issue</a>, and the response is a CDS Hook card:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="JSON"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">{</span>

<p>We do have a "website" metadata item in the VCI directory  for this purpose. It is intended to be a link that a consumer can follow to get information about how to obtain a health card from a given issuer. ( In general, we're looking at metadata in the directory as a kind of trial ground for things that we might want to standardize and push up to issuer based discovery endpoints.)</p>

<p>(I should also know that for issuers of supporting smart on fhir, it would typically be a wallet app responsible for checking and obtaining any available credentials on some regular basis, or when a credential  issuer key is discovered to have been revoked.

Certainly this could be defined, but it starts to overlap pretty quickly with the FHIR API for issuance we have today, and so far the issuers we have seen using non FHIR approaches don't offer an API at all, but rather want to interact with a consumer to have them verify control of a phone number or email address before issuing a card to them.</p>

If you wanted to expose an API where anyone could trade in a copy of a card that was signed with a bad key and obtain a new card signed with a good key...

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> are you specifically looking for an API automation for re-issuing? Meaning the server at the API can use more robust algorithms to prove that the old card "was" issued properly, so it issues a new card? If this is just an api to create a "fresh" card given an old card; then there is not much downside... but the new card should not invalidate the old, the old should stand on its own. Meaning this should not be an method for a malicious actor to scan a targets card, send that card to the API, so that the target is now holding a revoked card. The re-fresh API should not affect the old card status; while it is fully based on the old card authenticity.</p>

<p>the old card should be sufficient. no need to have the request extract these into api parameters.. right? The card already has them, and has a signature... even if the issuing certificate has expired or been revoked, the issuing service can look at the signature "in context" of the issuing time, and understanding why/when a revocation happened.

<p>The problem is that broadening the support for these use cases defeats the purpose of the entire spec. There are a lot of options that allow verifiers to talk directly to issuers. Grahame can choose any of them. What makes a Verifiable Credential different is exactly the fact that the communication between an issuer and a verifier is MEDIATED by the holder at all times. If you don't want that, you don't need a verifiable credential. There are simpler, faster, better ways to develop that communication outside the Verifiable Credential ecosystem. </p>

They don't wait for a third party app to come by and make an API call requesting it <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> So Grahame's use case here is a bit different. It's about cases where the issuer isn't willing to or can't just proactively send out a new card  and  instead is waiting for a  third party  app to trigger this step  (I'm not sure why? Maybe because the issuers don't know an email or SMS or physical street address where they can send a new SHC?  Or to account for cases where proactive sending was attempted but didn't really work and the user still needs help?).</p>

<p>proactive sending might be a useful "best current practice" that could be informatively said.... not clear to me that Grahame's use-case would not like that solution.</p>

<p>The UX problem here (the user needs help renewing their cards) is real and very common. There are many ways to solve it: One could allow the verifier to get a new card for the holder, a very convenient UX for the holder but one that breaks the triangle of trust model; or we can just extend the wallet/issuer requirements to include an API for the holder to do that by him/herself.  The more we empower the holder, the better the system gets.</p>

<p>Agree with this principle <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="458846">@Vitor Pamplona</span> ; to Grahame's point, some kinds of API endpoints that an issuer advertises fall into this category (individual holder requesting reissuance does) and others don't (e.g., "is card X [still] valid?).   The mechanism of discovery is the same.</p>

<p>To take this discussion forward, I think it would make sense to add an "extensions" or "rfcs" folder to our spec repository outside of the core spec content, akin to the FAQs we have today at <a href="https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/health-cards/tree/main/FAQ">https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/health-cards/tree/main/FAQ</a>...  where we try to outline a spec for this kind of discovery and see what serve adoption we can get. I don't want to start cramming new functionality into the specification unless someone in the real world wants to support it, but I understand there's a catch 22 here and I think there may be some common ground.  Anybody interested in drafting such a thing? Otherwise I can take a crack.</p>

<p>it does seem adjacent, or "trial"... yup. I just don't agree that having this specific kind of API is  contrary to SHC. Grahame has indicated the use-case is about a proper use of SHC, but where the issuing cert is revoked. That is why it is within SHC.  I would agree that this is not just an API for checking status, but why would a "check status" use-case of this same API be contrary to SHC?  Yes, a dominant design requirement of SHC is off-line-proofing, which an online "check status" is clearly contrary to; but the format of the card issued can be SHC and the validation from the point of the API returning can be the same SHC processing.... more important is that a service can explicitly reject "check status" if that instance of the service has a policy forbidding that use-case, while that service instance allows for "re-issue card that was invalidated by a issuing cert revocation".</p>

<p>That works fine if there's a login. It doesn't work if there isn't. What's important to me is the UX of passing the card to the issuer to establish the context of which card needs re-issuing, instead of trying to figure out how to describe that in human language</p>

<p>do we expect issuers to archive everything they have ever issued? Or do we think the design of SHC is such that they don't need to archive every card issued? I would hope the second. Not saying that they must not archive, but if the design requires archive of all issued cards then we move into needing to define functional and non-functional requirements of that archive.</p>

<p>how do you get the 'current key'?<br>
Note that https (TLS) will already be negotiating the current TLS keys, and using that to support encryption of the channel. Thus you get this for free. (recognizing the MITM risk if one does not do TLS (BCP195))</p>

<p>Can you help me understand what you mean here? Like the issuer name, for example? The way we have defined an issuer in health cards, and issuer would have one name and multiple keys  as it rotates them over time. But I might be missing something among your lessons learned.</p>

<p>In the Health Cards context,  We don't make any guarantees about an issuance hierarchy. So from your example either you have state-based issuance (perhaps with a national trust  that ties these together); or you have national issuance. </p>
<p>Issueres are free to rotate keys or segregate keys as they see fit, and the abstraction barrier is such that consumers can be oblivious to this. I understand now the tension between this model and what you are describing.</p>

<p>Understood.  But I don't think these would replace the top level issuer label, in this case; for example, a directory might only vet the top level issuer label, and any sub-issuer key-specific labels would be below the abstraction barrier. Of course, you could publish  such metadata on each key and it might be worth exploring this.  But I don't think it would obviate the need to do it at the top level, and the sort of metadata you would publish per key might be more in the realm of the hints. Anyway, probably worth starting a separate thread or proposal for this <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>The EU registry, for instance is quite interesting. Some countries have just one key. Those are easy. Others give individual keys to private corps that will in turn issue credentials. The EU Gateway also does not provide any information at the registry level beyond the keys themselves. Verifiers have to manually FIND and ask those companies for the appropriate way to represent the Issuer Name in their own certificates.</p>

<p>I would be in favor of packaging up some top level metadata that support wallet UI, and would prioritize that work over key-specific metadata, but these are separate points.</p>
