<p>No. Issuers with compromised keys can revoke their signing keys by omitting them from their jwks.json, but there is no standardized way to revoke an individual SMART Health Card.</p>

<p>Thank you <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>  for the quick revert. Signing key meaning the Issuer's private key right? Hmm, then revoking the issuer's private key will revoke all keys issued under that signing key. What is your recommendation to have the ability to revoke a single credential?</p>

<p>This hasn't been a design goal, so we haven't standardized a mechanism. Practically: Trust Frameworks could establish their own patterns on top of the SMART Health Cards spec. For example, via revocation lists. e.g., participating issuers could add unique identifiers to each Card via a JWS claim, and the trust framework or specific issuers could publish lists of revoked identifiers. One key consideration is privacy (e.g., protecting users from being tracked by issuers); it's important to ensure that checks don't reveal a specific certificate ID (but rather, ensure that revocation checks can be aggregated at the level of a group of, say, 10^5 or more certificates).</p>

<p>When I first implemented our system,  I backed the entire thing by PKI.  Every cert was signed with a RSA private key and every VC was backed by a digital certificate.  That would enable certificates to be revoked.  I am still maintaining that branch; however there are some technical concessions that have to be made to do it this way.</p>

<p>Hmm, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="396697">@Richard Braman (FLY.HEALTH)</span> does this imply that you were using a different <code>iss</code> URL for every Health Card you issued? This would create a direct and unavoidable privacy/tracking concern, and it's a behavior we probably want to prohibit at the spec level. (This isn't something that has come up in discussion before, as far as I'm aware.)</p>

<p>The spec does not detail a method of 'expiration' for the health card today. The card could be 'revoked' if the public keys associated with the Issuer's signature are no longer valid or are not registered with a trust network the Verifier uses.</p>
<p>Edit: went to 'Mentions' and didn't see all the responses - doh!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> No, the iss URL was the same.  In the PKI model, the credential subject is created from the certificate Subject and extended Subject attributes.  So it was not the FHIR bundle.  But truthfully, the data in the extended subject attributes could be converted back to the FHIR payload for purposes of conforming 100% to the SHC spec. In its current form, the PKI implementation conforms to the Wc3 VC spec, but not 100% to the SHC spec.</p>

<p>Which revocation scenario do you have in mind? Revoking erroneously issued health cards? As Josh said, not part of the spec, and might not be "critical" since there is no user key material to protect, but issued cards could be put on a revocation list using any UID derived from it (e.g., hash of the JWS).</p>

Erroneous, yes. Also, like issuing Lab results, it may only be valid for a few months, right? So, like if we are verifying a VC, should we consider it still valid even the contents are already expired?</p>

<p>Revocation is typically for "unplanned" situations (key compromise, creds issued in error, etc.), should be a different strategy than "planned" or defined usage, such as a limited validity period. The scope of the spec is to provide the clinical data, what happened, when, by/to whom. The fact that the lab result might not be valid anymore to make a health assessment doesn't make the health card itself invalid; verifiers will be able to make their authorization decision based on the data authenticated by the issuer.</p>
