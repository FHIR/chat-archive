<p>There's an old provisional scheme (prov/resource) sitting in the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml">IANA registry</a> next to (prov/oid, which incidentally appears to be the OID scheme FHIR uses). It was used by firefox back in the day, but I don't think this usage is meaningfully related.</p>

<p>If we wanted to change from <code>resource:0</code> I guess we'd just use <code>r:0</code> as the MITRE team suggested in a previous round of edits. I don't see value in breaking our "v1" implementers for this (given there's no practical implementation issue) but if folks feel strongly that it'd be a benefit, we could look at this as part of a v2 (I expect we'll have... a lot of proposed changes as we enter the HL7 consensus process).</p>

<p>Warning: FHIR validation currently does not work</p>
<p>The FHIR Validator currently generates a number of spurious errors when validating resources that are in fact valid. This is due to the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>For data minimization reasons, we use absolute URIs in resource:# format within our Bundles. We recently received clarification that this is supported in FHIR R4, but the FHIR Validator does not fully support this yet.</li>
<li>We do not include id elements in our resources for data minimization reasons. This element is not required as the cardinality is 0..1 (though this is only strictly allowed for sending resources to a server for create operations). The FHIR Validator requires id to be populated for all resources.</li>
<li>The terminology server used by the FHIR Validator (<a href="http://tx.fhir.org">tx.fhir.org</a>) does not support a number of value sets that we use, and some of the value sets that are supported our out of date (like CVX). This causes errors both in validating codes and Bundles that slice based on profiles with required value set bindings.</li>
<li>You will see warnings related to <a href="http://meta.security">meta.security</a> when validating that say A code with no system has no defined meaning. A system should be provided. This cannot be suppressed, but can be safely ignored.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yeah, I mean it's an important "capability to have" because in real life nobody is checking anything, and issuers that actually have id verification policies need a way to say it. But I don't think it'll make any practical difference, and mostly it'll be missing so the byte count is theoretical ;-)</p>

<p>the assurance level that the vaccine-credential relying-parties "want" is very unlikely to be the one under which the patient was given the vaccine.

My family experience in Wisconsin is that they are requiring a government picture ID, but they have procedures for accepting a friendly face. I am sure the scale and urgency of covid vaccine, they are never sending someone  away. That someone may not realize they would not qualify for a high assurance vaccine-credential.</p>

<p>Adding to the 'assurance level' discussion, as a vendor, we do not have visibility to an Issuer's SOPs related to identity verification, so we will not be populating that field. To do so would be a 'guess' on our part (and likely a default across all Issuers we support), which seems to defeat the purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a practical matter the type of identification provided to get immunized at the point of service varies. For my use case involving tourism in Europe, I know the traveller will have a passport so I got a development license for a passport reader sdk which processes the data from the e-passport using a passport reader  and will combine that with the data minimized Immunization resource to sign it.</p>

<p>I thought that might still be up for discussion; until we are more formally capturing something like a declaration of identity (subject claims the indicated demographics belong to them), it's certainly less meaningful to indicate "self asserted" (IAL1). My thoughts are that taking 1 away leaves its absence more ambiguous, though (NULL could mean either self asserted OR unknown); I also thought that some level of assurance was always required in the SHC spec. (What does that mean for an entity that cannot assert 1.2, 1.4, or 2?) If the community feedback is that "1" is not meaningful and won't be used, that does say something &amp; I can understand the decision in that case. I suppose IAL1 is still in the new ValueSet so other workflows can opt to use it if it makes sense in their use cases.</p>
