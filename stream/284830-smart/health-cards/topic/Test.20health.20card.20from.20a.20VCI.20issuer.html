<p>Any issuer in the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-commons-project/vci-directory/main/vci-issuers.json">VCI issuer directory</a> has a public test SMART Health Card? We're adding the ability to validate against the VCI directory in the <a href="https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/health-cards-validation-SDK">validation SDK</a>, and it would be helpful to add public data to our test suite.</p>

<p>This may be tricky given (6) and (7) of <a href="https://github.com/the-commons-project/vci-directory/blob/main/VCI%20Directory%20Agreement.pdf">https://github.com/the-commons-project/vci-directory/blob/main/VCI%20Directory%20Agreement.pdf</a></p>
<p>One way around this is for individuals to donate their own data; I'll be happy to do this whenever I'm able to get a SMART Health Card (I can see two possible issuers who may be able to give me one soon... but neither is online/working yet).</p>

<p>Would it make sense to have the issuer directory as an option (e.g. <code>-i, --issuerdirectory &lt;url&gt;</code>) which defaults to the VCI directory.</p>
<p>It would be really useful to have for Connectathon testing so that we could create a connectathon/test issuer directory to test health cards issued by test servers that wouldn't be registered in the official directory. A repo with a test directory and test data from different organizations issued by test servers (e.g. the Cerner test server, SMART Health Card spec examples) could also be useful for verifiers testing their issuer directory verification code without needing real examples or having to create and host their own directory. Just a thought and would have to be well marked to avoid misuse.</p>
