<p>I have a small testing company in western Colorado. I need assistance with this build. Can someone assist? I do not know anyone around here who can do this, so am reaching out to this group. ANY information would be incredibly helpful!!<br>

<p>The implementation California has done is open source: <a href="https://techblog.cdt.ca.gov/2021/09/releasing-our-digital-vaccine-record-code-on-github/">https://techblog.cdt.ca.gov/2021/09/releasing-our-digital-vaccine-record-code-on-github/</a><br>
I'm not sure how much that helps and even less sure if _they_ could help but it's the best advice I can give.</p>
