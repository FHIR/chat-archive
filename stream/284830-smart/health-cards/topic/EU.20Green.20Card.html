<p>Hi Guy, Does anyone have any insight into the European Union Green Card Covid Pass work that T-Systems (SAP) has apparently been asked to work on? Are they looking at our SMART Health Cards? The way the Green Card is described sounds very similar. <br>
Does anyone know anything?</p>

<p>Thank you both <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194174">@Paul Denning</span>  I've managed to find what I need, Paul your link appears to be the technical info I was looking for. Grrr wish we could all agree on one global standard for this, and world peace while we're at it</p>

<p>Anyone know/understand the rationale behind using CBOR instead of JSON for the token?<br>
Also interesting is that they define a sketchy blueprint for the trust model.</p>

<p>CBOR is a good fit for constrained payloads like QRs. We looked into CBOR for Health Cards, but the level of developer familiarity and library support is still low, especially for cryptographic operations (the CBOR equivalent of JWS). And after compression the CBOR artifacts aren't necessarily smaller (actually for long repetitive payloads, compressed JSON turned out to be a bit more space efficient than compressed CBOR).</p>

<p>Trust is the hardest part of this whole endeavor. We intentionally say very little about it in the Health Cards spec -- we just mandate one common method for key discovery, and leave hooks for trust frameworks to layer on top.</p>
