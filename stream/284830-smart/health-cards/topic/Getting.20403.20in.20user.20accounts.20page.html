<p>Is this set in stone? One of our main concerns is around adoption, and we've found that small "snags" in the workflow like this can cause a good amount of users to give up. Either they don't know/can't find their password, or just don't want to bother, especially given the hesitancy out there on this topic, having it "just work, and work well" might make the difference.</p>

<p>That's a great question - from my understanding, the goal of the project is for the patient to be able to integrate with their different hospitals/clinics/etc. to personally retrieve their health cards.</p>
<p>This might be a question we need to direct to the larger group in the <code>smart/internal-health-cards</code> chats.

<p>SMART Health Cards is focused on sharing data with consumers. When a consumer wants to connect an app of their choice to their health records inside of a clinical provider system, we use the SMART App Launch to accomplish this; the pattern is based on consumer approval and right of access, rather than business to business trust.</p>

<p>It's always possible for a clinical provider to enable business to business trust through use of technologies like SMART Backend Services, but the details of those kinds of arrangements are out of scope for the scenarios we established for this connectathon.</p>
<p>(On a practical level, I hope it is very clear what that would look like -- e.g., a somehow-authorized app could use Backend Services to obtain an access token with scopes like <code>system/patient.read system/Immunization.read</code>, and then could invoke an issuance operation just like we do for consumer authorized apps.)</p>

<p>Is there a potential middle ground here? We are a "connected health" company, and as such, our users authorize us to and have the expectation that we will collect their medical information once they authorize the connection one time. We only collect the information on behalf of the users, to be viewed/used at the users' sole discretion.<br>
Being able to pull in the SHC info along with, say, the rest of the Cerner EHR data could drive adoption of the use, as it would just show up in the app as ready to use and wouldn't require an additional, extra flow that might discourage adoption.</p>

<p>What you are describing is the crux of interoperability! And (...to be a bit provocative here -- please understand that I totally know where you're coming from!) from a certain vantage point, what you are asking for is that the ecosystem simply trust you because you're going to do the right thing. I'm not saying that's a bad idea; I am only saying it does not scale well, and does not build an end-to-end model of consumer trust.</p>

<p>If you can negotiate this level of trust with Cerner and with healthcare providers, the APIs are there to support you. But in my experience this negotiation is extremely challenging, slow, and (for some good reasons) limited; as such, it is safer to fall back on a consumer's right to access, which trumps these kinds of organizational trust decisions.</p>

<p>The forces of HIT Certification rules, HIPAA right of access, and Information Blocking prohibitions are all aligned to ensure the consumers have this kind of choice, but the alignment breaks down (i.e., you no longer get these <em>guarantees</em>) as soon as the trust decisions move into the hands of a covered entity.</p>

<p>I understand all that and strongly sympathize. The place where I'm getting a bit stuck thinking it through is: Say we (my company) have authorization to pull EHRs that include immunization information, and the customer requests that we pull their data: that immunization info is already going to be in our system. <br>
In such a case, I'm not sure if there is a greater risk for a immunization SHC to be pulled over as well, without requiring the user to OAuth all over again. We already have the information, we just don't have the SHARABLE information.<br>
I would, of course, not want to be able to pull information that we are not authorized to have via SHC, but if we are authorized, allowing the automatic sharing of the SHC as an extension of EHRs make sense to me, if there is not a technical reason why this couldn't be done.</p>

<p>I would say that's a good topic of discussion for you to work out with the vendors where you are currently authorized to pull data, building on whatever mechanism you're using there.
