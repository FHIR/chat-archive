<p>Hi Guys, just a few questions about available mobile device functionality for SMART Health Cards.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can the Apple iOS 15 release directly scan a QR Code barcode to get the SHC into the device or can it only be downloaded from a SMART on FHIR enabled FHIR API?</li>
<li>Can the Android CommonPass App directly scan a QR Code barcode to get the SHC into the device or can it only be downloaded from a SMART on FHIR enabled FHIR API?<br>
-Is Common's 'SMART Health Card Verifier App' a separate app dedicated to verifiers?  If so why is it not seen in the google play store, I only see the former app?</li>
</ul>
<p>What I am trying to work out is if we currently, or very soon, will have the ability for both iPhone and Android users to manually scan a SMART Health Card QR Code to allow them to store it on their phone, without the use of SMART on FHIR and a FHIR API.</p>
<p>Thanks guys</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, scanning in the camera app will offer to open in the Health app. (And in the 15.1 beta, these can be added to Apple Wallet also.)</p>

<p>There's a SMART Health Card Verifier app (on Android and iOS; see <a href="https://thecommonsproject.org/smart-health-card-verifier">https://thecommonsproject.org/smart-health-card-verifier</a>) for verifying SHCs; this is distinct from the <strong>Common Health</strong> app which is for storing/managing health data including SHCs (analogous to Apple's Health app on iOS). I'm not sure what you mean by "only see the former".</p>

<p>You definitely never need a FHIR API to access a SMART Health Card. Even without any special wallet app, you can just save it as a file or print it out. (FHIR API access can be a convenient way to access a SHC if you <em>already</em> have an app connected to your FHIR API, but by design this is definitely in the "nice to have, not required" category.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>  Thanks for the info on the Apple app. Just what I wanted to hear. <br>
It will be good to hear if the CommonsApp can do the same. <br>
I have now found the 'SMART Health Card Verifier App' on the Google play store, so thanks on that as well.<br>
I understand you don't need a FHIR API in the sense that you can print a QR Code or save it as a file. I was rather referring to the digital wallet Apps and how you can import a SHC into them. I feared that some only allowed the import via a FHIR API and not via a camera scan. If the CommanApp can import via camera scan then that covers off Android and I am good.<br>
Thanks again for your help.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191391">@Angus Millar</span> sorry for missing this earlier in the week. CommonHealth supports the following methods of importing SHCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Via SMART on FHIR for data sources that support it</li>
<li>Scanning a QR code via the camera from within the app</li>
<li>Importing an image or PDF that has a QR code in it</li>
<li>Importing a <code>.smart-health-card</code> file</li>
</ul>
