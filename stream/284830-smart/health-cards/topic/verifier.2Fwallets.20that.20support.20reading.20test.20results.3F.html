<p>Generally, it seems like there are many more apps that support reading/importing SHCs containing Immunizations than lab results. What verifiers/wallets support reading lab results in SHCs?</p>

<p>We do support them but don't have built out the proper SNOMED support</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191339">@Pascal Pfiffner</span> , thank you! I know that your application supports the .smart-health-card file import, and I think the FHIR operation, does it also supporting scanning a QR code to ingest a lab result SHC?</p>

<p>Yes, QR code scanning is supported but only for non-multi-QR codes at this time.</p>

<p>CommonHealth supports SHC lab results as well. :)</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="328301">@JP Pollak</span>, CommonHealth supports lab results in an SHC, but I think that SMART Health Card Verifier doesn't. Are there plans to add support for SHC lab results in the verifier application?</p>

<p>hey, yes- i don't have a timeline for this but test results is one of the next things i'd like to see addressed</p>

<p>Hi Friend, wanted to revise this thread to see what had changed. Are there verifier apps that support reading test results? It seems like this is a feature more important than ever.</p>
