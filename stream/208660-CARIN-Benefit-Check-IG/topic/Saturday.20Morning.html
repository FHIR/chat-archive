<p>Good Evening All - we look forward to seeing you tomorrow for the connectathon.  We have room 104 and 105 reserved in the morning for a quick huddle before heading to our table.  I plan on being there around 8:45 am if anyone is interested.  Looks like the team has made some good progress already so we are looking forward to getting some good feedback on our approach by the end of the weekend.  Have a great evening and see you tomorrow!</p>
