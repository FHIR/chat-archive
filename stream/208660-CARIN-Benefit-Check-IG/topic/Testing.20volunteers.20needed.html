<p>If you are a PBM or a health plan that has its own PBM and have built a FHIR infrastructure, we need your help! Please let us know if you would like to test this IG at an upcoming HL7 connectathon. We would like to work with you to test the IG (<a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-rtpbc/index.html">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-rtpbc/index.html</a>) with PBMs and third-party applications so consumers can get more access to their real-time pharmacy benefit information.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196361">@Ryan Howells</span>  - did any PBMs take you up on this offer? I'm curious if there are any test/demo implementations available. Thanks for your work in pushing this effort forward.</p>

<p>Yes, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="329194">@Jay Smith</span>. Multiple PBMs have expressed interest in testing this IG. Since many of them are connected to a health plan, we are waiting until they get their FHIR infrastructures set-up to be compliant with the CMS rule before we can begin testing. We expect that to happen for most of the big PBMs in Q1 of next year. If you or others are interested in being a client or server to test this IG, please email me and we'll get you on our list. We anticipate having virtual connectathons about every other month in 2021 either via HL7 or CARIN so it should provide ample opportunity for folks to get involved.</p>
