<p>Hello, I am inquiring about any resources the community is aware of regarding ECC certificates that can be had for free for testing and development purposes in conjunction with Smart Health solutions.</p>
<p>While it would not appear there are any, I wanted to ask in case someone might have found something obscure.</p>
<p>If not, are there any providers that are recommended from within the community?</p>
