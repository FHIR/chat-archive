<p>I am working on adding support for DateTime and Time literals and resource values, and I just noticed that the newly published R4 now adds support for leap seconds in time values (see the regular expression for the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#time" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#time">time data type</a>).  In particular, "60" is now allowed as a value for seconds, and ideally one would have 00:00:59 &lt; 00:00:60 &lt; 00:01:00 .   JavaScript does not like 60 as a value for seconds, and seems to have no support for leap seconds in general.  I am thinking about just replacing "60" with "59" when I see it.</p>
