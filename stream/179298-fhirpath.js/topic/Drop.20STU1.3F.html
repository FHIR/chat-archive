<p>There is at least one minor breaking change between STU1 of FHIRPath and what I gather will be called R2, having to do with the quoting of identifiers.  Does anyone have a need to support STU1 FHIRPath-specific features once R2 comes out?  I am thinking that it might not be worth the effort to maintain two branches of the code, and that it might be better to just move to R2 and stop development of the STU1 version.</p>
