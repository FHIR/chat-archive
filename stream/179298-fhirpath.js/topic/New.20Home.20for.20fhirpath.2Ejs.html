<p>The main repository for fhirpath.js is now in the HL7 space on GitHub:  <a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhirpath.js" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/HL7/fhirpath.js">https://github.com/HL7/fhirpath.js</a>.   The lhncbc/fhirpath.js repository will be deleted and recreated as a fork of HL7/fhirpath.js.  I will work on copying issues from the old repository to the HL7 one; unfortunately there seems to be no way to directly transfer issues between the two "organizations".  Also, the latest two GitHub "releases" (counting the new one that I will announce below) have been published on HL7/fhirpath.js, but I am not planning to re-publish the earlier ones, although they could be recreated if needed.</p>
