<p>When I started converting the IPS (International Patient Summary) IG to FSH, I ran into trying to figure out how to set <code>ValueSet.compose.include.version</code> to a specific code system version.  I didn't see any examples or other documentation on how to do that.  Mark Kramer suggested that using <code>* ^compose.include.version = “v123”</code> is the way to do that and has been supported for some time - and that makes perfect sense, except that so far it doesn't seem to be working.  This is the FSH syntax that I am using (except for most of the content - &gt; 26000 rows):</p>

<p>You can see that <code>compose.include.version</code> isn't flowing through to the ValueSet resource instance that Sushi generates.  Do I need to do something different in the FSH syntax.  Or is this a Sushi bug?</p>

<p>Because the CodeSystem syntax manages the components for you (grouping codes into components based on common systems, etc), we disabled <code>^</code> syntax on elements of <code>component</code> because it would be difficult for authors to identify the right component by index in complex code systems.  That said, SUSHI should produce an error when you attempt to do that (rather than just ignoring it).</p>

<p>Luckily, there are actually several ways to do what you're looking to do.  For example purposes, I've added one more code so you can see how it goes for multiple codes.  Here are some of your options:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>// Approach A
// Use {system}|{version}#{code} syntax for each code

ValueSet: VersionedSystemApproachA
* SNOMED_CT|http://snomed.info/sct/900000000000207008/version/20200731#109006 &quot;Anxiety disorder of childhood OR adolescence (disorder)&quot;
* SNOMED_CT|http://snomed.info/sct/900000000000207008/version/20200731#999999 &quot;Fake code for example purposes&quot;

// Approach B
// Set an alias to the full canonical URL of the system: {systemURL}|{version}
// then use the alias when defining each code

Alias: SCTv20200731 = http://snomed.info/sct|http://snomed.info/sct/900000000000207008/version/20200731

ValueSet: VersionedSystemApproachB
* SCTv20200731#109006 &quot;Anxiety disorder of childhood OR adolescence (disorder)&quot;
* SCTv20200731#999999 &quot;Fake code for example purposes&quot;

// Approach C
// Use syntax that lists codes and then ends with &quot;from system {system}|{version}&quot;

ValueSet: VersionedSystemApproachC
* #109006 &quot;Anxiety disorder of childhood OR adolescence (disorder)&quot; and
  #999999 &quot;Fake code for example purposes&quot;

<p>I will pick one of these approaches and get all of the "GPS" value sets defined with the correct version in FSH.  I'm also planning to convert the "GPS subset" value sets (like 'allergy-intolerance-substance-condition-gps-uv-ips') to be defined intensionally, using 2 instances of <code>ValueSet.compose.include.filter</code> inside a single <code>ValueSet.compose.include</code> (which should return the intersection of the two filters).  Can you point me to a way to do that in FSH?</p>

<p>The syntax for multiple filters is shown in the 4th row of the first table in the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/shorthand/reference.html#defining-value-sets">spec section on defining value sets</a>.  The basic syntax is:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>* include codes from system {CodeSystem name|id|url} where {filter} and {filter} and ...
</code></pre></div>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>* include codes from system SNOMED_CT where concept is-a #1234 &quot;Foo&quot; and concept is-a #6789 &quot;Bar&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>That example probably doesn't make actual sense, but it shows the basic approach.  Note that you can wrap the filters onto different lines if you want to make it more readable:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>* include codes from system SNOMED_CT where
    concept is-a #1234 &quot;Foo&quot; and
    concept is-a #6789 &quot;Bar&quot;

<p>Also, I just want to note that we have a new beta of SUSHI coming out soon (probably Monday) that has an improved <code>CodeSystem</code> syntax.  I don't know if you are defining code systems in FSH, but if so, you might want to check out the new stuff that allows for hierarchical codes and setting the individual concept elements (like designation and property).  See <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/reference.html#defining-code-systems">Defining Code Systems</a> and <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/reference.html#caret-paths">Caret Paths</a> in the current build (STU2) FSH spec.</p>

<p>Thanks, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191469">@Chris Moesel</span>  If in doubt, read the documentation! :)  When I looked at that before I was mainly trying to figure out the code system version issue in the include (which I missed), and I didn't really recall what was there for the filters.
