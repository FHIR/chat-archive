<p>Mark, here is what MFSH (Macro FSH) currently does.<br>
Lets talk about this and see what parts make sense to move into FSH.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Macros</p>
<p>Macros are inserts with the following additions.<br>
a) Named parameters.<br>
When the macro is defined, named parameters are defined. When called, each of those<br>
parameters must contain a value.<br>
#macro XXYYZ(alpha, beta, delta)<br>
#apply XXYYZ("alpha value", "beta value", "delta value")<br>
Anywhere in the code that 'alpha' is found, it is replaced with 'alpha value'.<br>
b) Global parameters.<br>
There are parameters that are defined globally, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>the id of the current profile</li>
<li>the url of the current profile.</li>
<li>parameters that can be set on command line<br>
many others<br>
These can be referenced in any macro just as if it was a named parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>c) Redirection<br>
The output of a macro can be redirected to a non-fsh file.<br>
The output file name can contain global and named parameters which will get expanded when the macro is called/executed (not when it is<br>
first defined)<br>
I use this to collate info such as node graph commands I process externalluy to generate svg images, and also to allow embedded<br>
macros to generate the --intro implementation guide files for each profile.</p>
<p>#macro XXYYZ() &gt; 'redirection path'<br>
d) Once flags<br>
The once flag allows a macro to be called only once, even if it is executed multiple times.<br>
Example of how this can be used:<br>
Several macros are defined that add distinct sliced Observation.component items. These macros are sometimes used in a profile together, and<br>
in some profiles separately.<br>
Each macro calls a common macro to add component slicing; this should only be called once per profile.<br>
One way to handle this is to force the user to call this macro separately, once per profile, but this requires the user to<br>
manually add this and allows opportunities to not call it.<br>
So a macro is defined that implements the required slicing commands, and it is called with the once flag set, so it<br>
only generates FSH output the first time it is called.<br>
There are two flavors of the once flag.</p>
<ul>
<li>restrict calls to once per profile</li>
<li>restrict the calls to once period.<br>
Named Parameters can be a problem here, as multiple calls can be made with difference named parameter values, and only<br>
the first call will create output with its unique parameter values.</li>
</ul>
<p>// this is expanded once per profile.<br>
#macro once XXYYZ()<br>
#end</p>
<p>// this is expanded once, no matter how many times it is called.<br>
#apply once XXYYZ()</p>
<p>Fragments</p>
<p>A fragment is kinda a cross between a profile and a macro.<br>
The purpose of a fragment is to define a profile fragment that<br>
a) can be added to multiple profiles (like a macro)<br>
b) is intended to signal to code generators that each fragment can be treated like a separate 'thing' (class or interface).<br>
c) breaks the output profile into separate pieces that are functionally unique, implemented in multiple profiles, and documented as separate 'thing'.</p>
<p>Example.<br>
I create a fragment 'f' that is three Observation.component items.<br>
I include the fragment in multiple profiles 'a', 'b', and 'c'.</p>
<p>I generate a c# project that implements a class to process these profiles.<br>
I can generate a method 'm' that can accept an interface 'f' that mimics the fragment 'f'.<br>
Classes are created that mimic profiles 'a', 'b', and 'c', each of which implements interface 'f'.<br>
I can call method 'm' with an instance of 'a', 'b', or 'c'.</p>
<p>So a fragment is a part of a profile that is to be implemented in multiple profiles but treated like a 'distinct' item<br>
in generated artifacts (including implementation guide).</p>
<p>The fragment would have a parent class (like Observation).<br>
It should generate an item in the implementation guide showing exactly what it implemented.<br>
It should generate documentation in the documentation guide indicating what profiles implement it.</p>
<p>A profile can include one or more fragments just like a macro.<br>
No named parameters are allowed in a fragment call.</p>
<p>The fragments generate structure definition and other meta data allowing external code generation tools to recognize<br>
when a fragment has been defined, and where it is used. Programming artifacts can be generated from this info.</p>
<p>#Fragment: Observation.Component.NotPreviouslySeenFragment<br>
#Parent: Observation<br>
#Title: "NotPreviously Seen Fragment"<br>
#Description: """</p>
<p>Adds NotPreviously Seen Component slice.<br>
"""<br>
#apply Observation.Component.Add("notPreviouslySeen", "0..*", "Not Previously Seen", "Not Previously Seen",</p>
<h1>"""</h1>
<h1>This slice contains the optional components that define prevous encounters in which this abnormality was not seen.</h1>
<h1>The value of this component is a codeable concept chosen from the NotPreviouslySeenVS valueset.</h1>
<h1>""",</h1>
<h1>"ObservationComponentSliceCodesCS#notPreviouslySeen")</h1>
<h1>#apply Observation.Component.SetConcept("notPreviouslySeen", "1..1", "NotPreviouslySeenVS")</h1>
<p>#end</p>
<p>Conditional compilation</p>
<p>This is completely experimental and I have not found it to be useful so far, but there may be instances where it may become useful.<br>
This is identical to conditional compilation in c++, c3, etc.<br>
We may want to ignore adding this to FSH. Not sure if it will ever be usefull, though we still need some way to implement<br>
different countries using similar profiles.</p>
<p>i.e.</p>
<p>#if (value1=="true")<br>
if value1 is true, then include all text here.<br>
#else if (value2=="false")<br>
if value1 is false, then include all text here.<br>
#else<br>
otherwise include all text here.<br>
#end</p>
<p>The original purpose of conditional compilation was to allow a profile to be made that could be compiled for different countries.</p>
<p>i.e.<br>
Profile: Hello<br>
Parent: Observation<br>
#if Country == "US"</p>
<p>greeting = "Hello"<br>
#else if Country == "CA"</p>
<p>greeting = "Hello, eh"<br>
#else if Country == "NO"</p>
<p>greeting = "Uff da"<br>
#else if Country == "AU"</p>
<p>greeting = "G'Day"<br>
#end</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192611">@Kurt Allen</span> Chris is out for the next week and a half, and I would like to wait for him before we have a discussion. In the meantime, I have captured your suggestions and some initial questions/responses in the attached MS Word document (I find it easier to comment on particular aspects of your proposal in that format): <a href="/user_uploads/10155/lrb0O1iPV6RoMLWt5lmgCzuy/Macros-Kurt-Design-Document.docx">Macros-Kurt-Design-Document.docx</a></p>
