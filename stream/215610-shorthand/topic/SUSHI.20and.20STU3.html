<p>In the UK, there is a project at <a href="https://github.com/yorkshire-and-humber-care-record/fhir-ig">https://github.com/yorkshire-and-humber-care-record/fhir-ig</a> that appears to be using SUSHI to create derivative STU3 profiles.<br>
Does SUSHI work with STU3? I thought it was R4 onwards.</p>

<p>SUSHI does not support STU3.  It only supports FHIR 4.0.1 and up.</p>
<p>Looking at that IG, it looks like they're doing something interesting.  As far as SUSHI is concerned, they are working in  FHIR 4.0.1 (see <a href="https://github.com/yorkshire-and-humber-care-record/fhir-ig/blob/master/fsh-tank/sushi-config.yaml#L13">config</a>).  The interesting bit is that it looks like after SUSHI generates the R4 JSONs, they have <a href="https://github.com/yorkshire-and-humber-care-record/fhir-ig/tree/master/fsh-tank/scripts/convert-stu3">scripts</a> to that translate the generated R4 to STU3.</p>
