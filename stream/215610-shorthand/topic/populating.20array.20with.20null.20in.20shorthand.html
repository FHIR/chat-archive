<p>I am trying to populate an array in an example instance with null for a special use-case. <br>
I have searched up and down the "language reference" site but there isn't a single word on the subject. I also goFSHed a JSON file that has a null where I would like it but the FSH file shows nothing. Is there a way to do this in FSH or is this a special case where I am forced to work directly on the JSON? If so, this is a problem, as SUSHI always deletes the resources folder so this means I would be forced to save the JSON in a separate location, which is problematic at this point.</p>

<p>If you want an element in an array to be null, this can be accomplished by skipping an index when assigning values in the Instance. Note that SUSHI will emit a warning when doing this, since this is not usually correct. If you want the array element itself to be null, however, SUSHI does not currently have a way of doing this.</p>

<p>I'm not sure of your use case, but FHIR doesn't support nulls.  If you don't have a value for an element you would need to omit it (or use an extension with Data Absent Reason).</p>

<p>As a note, in <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/json.html#primitive">JSON</a> there is a time when <code>null</code> is present.  If you have an array of primitives that have extensions and not every element has both, the indexes have to match and you end up with explicit nulls (edit: note this can be in either direction):</p>
