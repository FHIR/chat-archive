<p>Hello --</p>
<p>When gofsh processes files, it looks at the "name:" in the JSON file. This will produce the fish file with that "name". However, when you run the produced file through sushi, it'll complain about the files having to be ASCII encoded. </p>
<p>Granted, this is but a minor annoyance for anybody working with Latin-1 alphabets (ISO/IEC 8859-1 - <a href="/user_uploads/10155/jHXDs_UAdhJ3f2xZvD18qned/sushi-ascii-centrism2.png">sushi-ascii-centrism2.png</a> the people with the ás, the és, the ças, the ås, äs, æs etc), but this is too anglo-centric, IMHO, if I dare say so.  Like I said, for Latin-1 alphabets, that's a minor nuisance - but what about non-romanized alphabets?</p>

Is this really something that is necessary? In 2021, the toolchain for many languages already have embraced UTF-8 encodings (e.g., Rust etc.). <a href="/user_uploads/10155/dYECVvZEPHEKDxqoW_3ntgyz/sushi-ascii-centrism2.png">sushi-ascii-centrism2.png</a></p>

<p>I can do regexp searches and pipe them all to iconv (on Unix/Linux - there's probably an equivalent with Power Shell), though. But it would be nice if sushi could automagically do this.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="437401">@Hank Lenzi</span>.  I understand your concern, but SUSHI is just following the recommendations and constraints established by the FHIR specification itself.  If you look at how FHIR defines <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-definitions.html#ValueSet.name">ValueSet.name</a>, you'll see this:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/10155/MiSq4WMm-sUqQftVBEe_53Zl/image.png">image.png</a> </p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/10155/MiSq4WMm-sUqQftVBEe_53Zl/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/10155/MiSq4WMm-sUqQftVBEe_53Zl/image.png"></a></div><p>The bit outlined in red is saying that a name <em>should</em> start with A-Z and consist only of A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _. Anything else should produce a warning (which is what SUSHI does).  But again... this was established by the FHIR spec, not SUSHI or FSH.</p>
<p>If you want SUSHI to suppress these warnings, you should be able to do so via a <code>sushi-ignoreWarnings.txt</code> file, documented <a href="https://fshschool.org/docs/sushi/project/#ignoring-warnings">here</a>.</p>

<p>Name is intended to be used for computation purposes only (class names, table names, etc.)  The rules were established to ensure that names would work with most/all such software tools and languages.  (I'll admit that many of these suffer from being overly presumptive around the use of the U.S. character set.)  If you want to convey something intended for reading and use by humans, use 'title' - and you're free to use any valid Unicode characters you like there.</p>
