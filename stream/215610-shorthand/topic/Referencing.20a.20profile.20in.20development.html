<p>Good morning! My team is currently working on an IG and are developing a few different profiles at the same time. One of these profiles (a Condition-based profile) needs the subject to reference the Patient-based profile we're currently working on. Is there a way in FSH to reference this profile since it hasn't been put online anywhere yet but is just another structure definition in the folder?</p>
