<p>Hello everyone, </p>
<p>I would like to know if there are any ways to combine SNOMED codes in hierarchy in a Value set. For example, I would like to represent "Tumor Invasion of renal sinus fat"  as three SNOMED codes 370052007 "Tumor Invasion",  66558008 "Renal Sinus Structure" and 256674009 "Fat" in hierarchy (The codes are not related in SNOMED). </p>
<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="425098">@Shruthi Rajasekar</span>.  There are ways of combining multiple codes into a value set (see <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/shorthand/reference.html#defining-value-sets">Defining Value Sets</a>), but that groups them into a flat list and doesn't denote the types of relationships your talking about.</p>
<p>What you describe sounds more like a <a href="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/postcoordinated+expression">postcoordinated expression</a>.  I think this type of combination of three concepts to express a single idea would normally be represented as a single Coding or CodeableConcept with a SNOMED <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/snomedct.html#4.3.1.0.5">expression</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not an expert in this area, and I don't know how well post-coordinated expressions are supported in systems today. You might want to discuss this further in the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179202" href="/#narrow/stream/179202-terminology">#terminology</a> stream.</p>
