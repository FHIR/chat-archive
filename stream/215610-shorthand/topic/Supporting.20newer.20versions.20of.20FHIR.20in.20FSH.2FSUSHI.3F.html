<p>I thought I had posted about this before, but I couldn't find the proper search-fu to find my old topic.  I have an IGuide that is dependent on resource changes that are in at least v4.5.0 of FHIR.  As we all know, SUSHI/FSH supports R4 but not anything more recent.  I'm kind of stuck since my guide is all in FSH but I do need the 4.5 versions of some resources.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191469">@Chris Moesel</span> do we (and by we I mean the royal we) have a timeline on when SUSHI/FSH might support 4.5.0 or current?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192166">@Jean Duteau</span> -- it depends on what you need from 4.5.  If you don't need native FSH support for <code>integer64</code> or <code>CodeableReference</code> then you can probably get by with the next release of SUSHI (due in the next two weeks).  That release will be the first release that allows you to specify your version of FHIR as <code>4.5</code> or <code>current</code>.  That said, the 4.5/current stuff isn't heavily tested yet, so you should think of it as a beta experience.</p>

<p>I might not need CodeableReference yet and I can probably muddle by without that for a bit.</p>
