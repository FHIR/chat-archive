<p>So I just did a silly thing on an extension definition:<br>
Extension: blah<br>
Id: blah</p>
<ul>
<li>extension.value[x] only CodeableConcept</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you see it?  I accidentally added extension in my first constraint.  Obviously a user error, but I feel that a warning from SUSHI would be appropriate here because, without any other constraints, this probably isn't what the user really wanted.</p>

<p>Hmmm... so that is <em>technically</em> valid (essentially saying all sub-extensions must have CodeableConcept values), but I agree that it's almost always a mistake.  So far we've only flagged "probably mistakes" in rare circumstances (the only one that comes to mind is when we changed extension syntax).</p>
<p>If we were to issue a warning, what would you suggest the condition be under which we issue the warning?  Constraints on <code>extension.*</code> without a <code>contains</code> rule to declare sub-extensions?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, that is probably the condition.  Did you actually mean to constrain extension.* when you didn't declare actual sub-extensions?</p>

<p>OK.  I logged an issue so we can keep track of it, but we probably won't address it right away: <a href="https://github.com/FHIR/sushi/issues/514">https://github.com/FHIR/sushi/issues/514</a></p>
