<p>I'm trying to horn in a JSON vocabulary (we have a few hierarchical ontologies we need added). I'm just testing with one I grabbed from the genomics working group, it's called "input/vocabuary/CodeSystem-SequencePhaseRelationshipCS.json" but when I run sushi, it doesn't get added to the IG. I've tried moving it to "resources", but that didn't change. Is there a setting I need to change someplace to get it to look for these types of things?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="387261">@Eric Torstenson</span>.  I assume that <code>input/vocabuary</code> (with a missing L) is just a typo, right?  That <em>should</em> work (when spelled correctly).  Can you check to see if SUSHI is adding it to the <code>ImplementationGuide-{packageId}.json</code> file it generates in <code>fsh-generated/input/resources</code>?</p>
<p>Also... SUSHI 2.0 will be coming out in the next few weeks, with support for hierarchical code systems, so... you can look forward to that!</p>

<p>OK. I'm officially embarrassed! So, should it have worked in resources (presuming no typos) as well, or must they be in vocabulary? Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>Yes, I'd expect it to work in either case.  So if it's not, then there is something unexpected going on...</p>
