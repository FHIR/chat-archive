<p>Has there been any thought about supporting import in FSH?<br>
This ties back to my previous efforts to work around FHIR's lack of multiple inheritance. My thought is to define a rule (in IG 1) and have profiles in IG 1 and 2 insert that rule. Right now it looks like the only way to do this would be to symlink the file IG 1 rule file into the IG 2 project directory.</p>

<p>Re-usable FSH modules is something we've thought about in the abstract, but haven't yet gone much further than the "gee that would be neat" phase.  This brings with it all sorts of questions about dependency management -- how should it work, do we leverage existing IG dependency management, what if the sharable FSH isn't in an IG, etc).</p>

<p>Yes, I was thinking about those challenges too. I think the fact that the fsh files don't end up in the generated product (or npm) adds to the complexity. Also the fact that sushi doesn't treat the input as separate files, but instead as one bag of content makes it hard. That said, having a "library" of rules that could be brought into an IG might be useful.</p>
