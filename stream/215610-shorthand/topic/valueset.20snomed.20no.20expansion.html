<p>I wrote the following fsh defining a ValueSet which uses codes from the Swedish version of SNOMED (with URI <a href="http://snomed.info/sct/45991000052106">http://snomed.info/sct/45991000052106</a>)</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Alias : SCT_SE = http://snomed.info/sct/45991000052106
ValueSet: SeverityValueSet
Id: severity-value-set
Title: &quot;Severity Value Set&quot;
Description: &quot;&quot;
* include SCT_SE#442452003 &quot;livshotande&quot;
* include SCT_SE#59021000052107 &quot;skadlig&quot;
* include SCT_SE#59031000052109 &quot;besvärande&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>When running sushi on the fsh-file I do get out a resource, but I do not see an expansion of the valueset with links to each concept in the valueset (see screenshot). I do get an expansion if I indicate the "base" version of SNOMED, however.<br>
Is this known behavior/as it should? Or am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>I don't know if that is the right way to express a national release of SNOMED.</p>

<p>you are still referring to SNOMED. The problem is that the terminology server does not know the swedish extension, so those codes are not known in the normal SNOMED</p>

<p>Thank you for your answer Jose :)<br>
I do think that is the way to refer to a national release of SNOMED and that the ID of the swedish edition is right, at least according to this <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/snomedct.html#4.3.1.0.3">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/snomedct.html#4.3.1.0.3</a><br>
There it says that if one does not specify the version, the terminology server might revert to the latest version of the international edition. I at the moment do not specify the version, so that might explain why the codes are not known.</p>

<p>thanks Gino, I did not know of this syntax. The next issue may be if the server does not support the Swedish edition of SNOMED</p>

<p>I know that the department of health and welfare are trying to get the swedish version published in the terminology server and are talking with Graham about this.<br>
We refer to a swedish Snomed codesystem like this: <a href="http://snomed.info/sct|http://snomed.info/sct/45991000052106">http://snomed.info/sct|http://snomed.info/sct/45991000052106</a></p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192129">@Daniel Karlsson</span>  will know more about this</p>

<p>Right.  It hasn't been explicitly mentioned yet -- but I don't believe that this is a SUSHI/FSH issue.  SUSHI doesn't expand value sets -- that is the job of the HL7 IG Publisher; and if the HL7 IG Publisher doesn't yet support the Swedish edition of SNOMED, that would explain what you're seeing in the published value set.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="195664">@Arvid Thunholm</span> This is a long delayed response.  But I want to let you know that I was working for a while with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192129">@Daniel Karlsson</span>  on getting the Swedish edition of SNOMED CT imported and supported on <a href="http://tx.fhir.org">tx.fhir.org</a>, but we ran into some impediments and since then it's been on the back burner for a while.  I have the importer issue resolved now and I'm happy to try again and I think we should be able to make progress with this now.  The main thing that we need to make it work is a current and complete Swedish edition snapshot in a single set of files (that's what Daniel and I had worked on, but I think it likely will need some updating now).</p>

<p>Sorry for an even longer delay in response,  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span> and I were working on getting the Swedish SNOMED CT edition into <a href="http://tx.fhir.org">tx.fhir.org</a>. Now we're almost at the next Swedish release (May 31) but after this we might give this a new try. Alternatively, we could set up a separate terminology server instance somewhere.</p>

<p>I'd say let's give it a go again after May 31.  We just need to figure out a staightforward but systematic approach to combining the files, so it's a repeatable process that can be used to maintain it going forward.</p>
