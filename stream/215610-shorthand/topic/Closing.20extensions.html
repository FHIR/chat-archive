<p>I need to limit the allowed extensions in a profile to just those defined in the profile.  How is this done in FSH?</p>

<p>a) This is a bad idea<br>
b) this is really hard to do as there are many holes you have to plug<br>
c) declare extension and modifierExtension to only have X repetitions (instead of being 0..*) where X is the number of extensions you want.  NOTE: You have to declare those two to be 0..0 everywhere you haven't already defined an extension since extensions can appear anywhere.  Datatypes can have extensions, every field in your resource can have extensions, every field inherited by your resource can have extensions, etc.  That's a lot of places to declare extensions off-limit.<br>
d) this is still a really bad idea</p>
