<p>I recall that there was a plan to have a web based sushi for people to use directly - have I remembered right? And if I have, then will it include an http 'operation' to convert from FSH -&gt; FHIR  that could be called by some other app?</p>

<p>We're working on a webapp called FSH Online -- but it's more like a playground than a full-fledged solution for managing SUSHI projects online.  You basically type some FSH in on the left side of the screen, click a button, and get JSON on the right side of the screen.  It's a pure HTML/JS/CSS app with client-side execution -- so it runs on a simple HTTP server (or in our case, GitHub Pages).  That being the case, it will not support HTTP web service calls or remote execution (because that would require a server capable of server-side javascript).</p>

<p>Actually - that sounds even better (assuming the library is available for external use). My use case is that a number of the clinFHIR modules create instances from a UI - but I have lots of fun producing the instances at times. I was hoping to be able to piggyback off your work - ie produce an FSH file and get sushi to produce the instance...</p>
