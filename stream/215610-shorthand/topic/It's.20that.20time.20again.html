<p>Thanks, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191387">@Keith Boone</span>!  As you noted, there's a great team behind this.  In addition, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191447">@Mark Kramer</span> has done a great job leading the way on FHIR Shorthand w/ the FHIR community -- and the community itself has been immensely helpful!  We're really excited to hear that it's already improved your productivity as well!  I just wish we could fit <em>everyone</em> on that bike. ;-)</p>
