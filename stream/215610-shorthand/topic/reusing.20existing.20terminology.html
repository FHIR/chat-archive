<p>Hi FSH-people. Is there an easy way to reuse the terminology already stated in existing CodeSystem/ValueSet files in Json/xml, in FHS? The case is that the terminology is already maintained in a running system and upon IG updates I am looking into doing an export of the CodeSystem/ValueSets and I need to know if I need to convert them to FSH before they can be used in the FSH files</p>

<p>you have CodeSystem/ValueSet files that you want to import into your guide?  If so, just put them in input/resources and then you can refer to them by their ID in your FSH files.</p>

<p>What <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192166">@Jean Duteau</span> said -- you can put FHIR JSON/XML in <code>input/resources</code> (or a few other <code>input/*</code> variants) and SUSHI will recognize their existence so that your FSH code can reference them.  If SUSHI is building your IG JSON for you, then it will also include them in that so that they are published w/ the IG.</p>
<p>But if you just want to reference them without them being a part of the IG, then ideally they would be published as a separate package in the registry; and then you would just declare them as a dependency.</p>

<p>FWIW, this is the approach we took when migrating the Clinical Genomics Reporting IG to FSH last November. :-)</p>

<p>I considered option with separate IG but just using them as sounds easier ;)</p>
