<p><strong>Announcing GoFSH 1.4.2</strong> with the following bug fixes and minor enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix output paths for resources with path separators in their <code>name</code> (details below)</li>
<li>Improve processing of extensions that don't follow the expected approach</li>
<li>Update dependency libraries to address known vulnerabilities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vulnerability w/ Output Paths and Resource Names</strong></p>
<p>For some output styles, GoFSH generates file names based on the resource name. In past versions of GoFSH, if the name contained one or more path separators, it was possible to cause GoFSH to write the FSH file to other locations on the filesystem. This behavior could be abused to intentionally overwrite existing FSH files on the system. The utility of leveraging this bug, however, is limited by the fact that the file extension will always be <code>.fsh</code> and the file contents will always be FHIR Shorthand.  In this version of GoFSH, the bug has been fixed by properly sanitizing file names before writing them to disk.</p>
