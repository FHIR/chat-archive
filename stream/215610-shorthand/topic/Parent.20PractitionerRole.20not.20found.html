<p>Hi. Does anyone know why I might be getting this error when running Sushi on profiles containing "Parent: PractitionerRole" ? <br>
The error is: Parent PractitionerRole not found for PractitionerRoleTest<br>
[path shortened] /input/fsh/VJPractitionerRoleTest.fsh   Line: 2 - 6<br>
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="209937">@Andy Harrison</span> - I would not expect that error.  When I do a simple test on FHSOnline (<a href="https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/share/3wVoTRS">link</a>), it works fine.  I can only think of two things that might cause this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If there is some weird hidden character that somehow snuck into that line.  To fix this, I'd delete the line with <code>Parent: PractitionerRole</code> and then retype it.</li>
<li>If your FHIR cache is corrupted (and does not contain PractitionerRole). One way to test this is to rename your cache to something else (which is a more temporary measure than deleting it) and then try again (which will force the cache to be re-downloaded).  Your FHIR cache is typically in <code>{User Home Directory}/.fhir</code> (note: <code>{User Home Directory}</code> is different on Mac and Windows, which is why I don't specify it directly here).</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191469">@Chris Moesel</span>  - Thanks  for your quick reponse. it's a bit of. a mystery. I tried both those actions and updated the Sushi to the 2.0.0-beta.1 that I saw was running on the FSHOnline. Same error, however, so I will need to dig around a little more. I also get the error when copying across your example.</p>

<p>I am perplexed.  What operating system are you running on? Are you using FHIR R4? Are you using a standard <code>sushi-config.yaml</code>? Does it work ok with other resources (just not <code>PractitionerRole</code>)?  Another thing you could try is using <code>sushi --init</code> to create a brand new project, then copy/paste the definition from FSH Online into <code>input/fsh/patient.fsh</code> and see if it works.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191469">@Chris Moesel</span>  I'm running MacOS 11.2.3, editing with VS Code and the FSH plugin. I have a set of 10 profiles in the project and all are running without errors except the PractitionerRole. If I create an IG with sushi --init and copy in the example for PractitionerRole on its own it works ok. But as soon as I combine it with the other profiles (patient, careplan, careteam, practitioner, group, goal etc) I get this same error even if I leave the PractitionerRole in it's most minimal form. I have tried adding the files in different orders and editing with a simple text editor but always end up with the same error once all files are added.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191469">@Chris Moesel</span>  Chris, I found the problem - my bad. I had named a valueset PractitionerRole in the Practitioner profile which was causing the problem. Sorry to waste yor time.</p>

<p>Ah-ha!  Thanks for letting me know.  It's not a waste of my time at all, because now I know what the issue is, and knowing that might help me help someone else in the future!  We can also look into this to see if it is a case we can easily identify programatically and issue a more helpful error.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191469">@Chris Moesel</span>  Can we make the error message more explicit? E.g., "SUSHI found a value set named PractitionerRole but needed to find a resource named PractitionerRole"?</p>

<p>Yeah, this is logged as an issue here: <a href="https://github.com/FHIR/sushi/issues/858">https://github.com/FHIR/sushi/issues/858</a> and is one of the tasks we are working on in our current sprint</p>
