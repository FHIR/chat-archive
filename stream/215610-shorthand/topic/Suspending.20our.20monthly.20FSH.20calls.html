<p>Chris and I have decided to suspend our monthly conference calls, including the one that would normally be held this Thursday. The number of participants has been declining, and at the same time, other outlets for discussion have gained traction (here, Connectathons, DevDays, etc.) Depending on how things go, we might reinstitute the calls at a later date.</p>
