<p>There are elements being added in on the example resources automatically. This is generally a very useful thing. However, for a specific example, I'm interested in omitting a few elements (id, text, and extension). I'm not sure what the best way to do so is and wanted to check here. Thanks!</p>

<p>When generating instances, SUSHI will automatically add any elements that have fixed values and a min &gt; 0 in the profile.  There isn't a way to turn off this behavior, but I think you might be able to circumvent it by creating an <code>Instance</code> and setting the parent to the <em>resource</em> (e.g., <code>Patient</code>) instead of the profile (e.g., <code>USCorePatient</code>).  Then, if you want, you can set the <code>meta.profile</code> to the URL of your profile (if you still want it to reflect that it is an instance of that profile).  I <em>think</em> that will avoid most of the SUSHI auto-generated stuff.  The one thing that I think you can't suppress no matter what is the <code>id</code> -- because that's how we actually track the instances across the IG.  Maybe we could introduce a way to turn even that off, but for now I think you're stuck with it.</p>
