<p>I am suddenly getting a lot of errors in my profile snapshots - but it is for attributes that I havn't even constrained. It says :"Profile <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/PlanDefinition">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/PlanDefinition</a> is for type StructureDefinition[http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/PlanDefinition], which is not a Canonical Resource (which is required because the CarePlan.instantiatesCanonical element has type canonical)"</p>
<p>I can see the lines in the json-snaphot-file that the errors refer to, but they are fsh/sushi generated.</p>
<p>Maybe there are some changes going on, that I am not aware of?</p>
<p>Best regards<br>
Kirstine</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194347">@Kirstine Rosenbeck Gøeg</span> -- by default, SUSHI only generates the <code>differential</code> portion of a <code>StructureDefinition</code>.  The only way that SUSHI generates a snapshot is if you explicitly tell it to via the <code>-s</code> or <code>--snapshot</code> flag.  Assuming you're not using that, then it is the IG Publisher that is generating that snapshot.  This <em>sounds</em> like an IG Publisher issue to me, but if you're able to include a snippet of FSH that reproduces this, we can look into it further (as it <em>could</em> be a SUSHI issue).</p>

<p>It looks like this might be a more widespread bug in the publisher.  See: <a href="#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/Canonical.20Errors.20on.20latest.20IG.20Publisher">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/Canonical.20Errors.20on.20latest.20IG.20Publisher</a></p>

<p>Thanks for the help <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191469">@Chris Moesel</span> . As soon as I read your first post, I recognized that it was definitely an IG-publisher problem. And yes, it was the same issue as described in your link. With the IG-publisher v1.1.75, the problem is resolved.</p>
