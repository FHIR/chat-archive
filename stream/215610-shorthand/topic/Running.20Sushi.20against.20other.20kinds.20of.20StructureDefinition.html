<p>Structured Definitions exist for both CDA (see ) and HL7 V2.  I'm wondering if I can "Profile" against those SDs in FHIR Shorthand, or create examples against them?</p>

<p>Oh. Hmmm... that's a really interesting question.  I'm assuming that you're not talking about CDA or HL7 v2 <em>profiles</em> on FHIR resources, but rather a set of new resource definitions and/or logical models.  Is that right?</p>
<p>We certainly haven't tested that -- but in theory I think that a lot of the same processing would apply.  For it to have any chance of working though, they'd at least have to use the FHIR data types (e.g., <code>string</code>, <code>code</code>, <code>CodeableConcept</code>, <code>Quantity</code>, etc).  And currently, we can only pull dependencies that are in <a href="http://fhir.packages.org" target="_blank" title="http://fhir.packages.org">fhir.packages.org</a> -- so they'd either need to be there or SUSHI would need to be updated to find dependencies elsewhere...  That would be the starting point at which we could at least <em>test</em> the feasibility.</p>
<p>All that said, we (MITRE) are currently trying to focus on the core features -- so we likely won't have time to seriously look at something like this for a while.  But it's an interesting thing to think about...</p>

<p>I think the CDA SD (see <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-cda/index.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-cda/index.html">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-cda/index.html</a>) uses new data types, and I'm certain that V2 Refactored (see <a href="http://www.hl7.eu/refactored/hl7.html" target="_blank" title="http://www.hl7.eu/refactored/hl7.html">http://www.hl7.eu/refactored/hl7.html</a>)</p>

<p>Sushi and the FHIR IG Builder solve a LOT of problems for HL7 if we can get it to work against those SDs...<br>
Hmmm...</p>

<p>New data types is definitely a problem.  A lot of what SUSHI does is pretty dependent on types.  We need to know a string is a string, a Coding is a concept, a Quantity is a quantity, etc.  Abstracting that might be messy.  Not impossible (for sure), but quite potentially messy.</p>
