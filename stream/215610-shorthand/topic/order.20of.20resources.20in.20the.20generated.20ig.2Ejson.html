<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191415">@Giorgio Cangioli</span>.  Thanks for reporting this.  I've just tested it in SUSHI and confirmed that the order you declare resources in the <code>sushi-config.yaml</code> does <em>NOT</em> affect the order of the resource list in the generated ImplementationGuide resource.  I think we can fix this, but it does raise a question...</p>
<p>In <code>sushi-config.yaml</code>, you do not have to specify the full resource list; you're allowed to list only the resources you want to "override" metadata values for -- in which case the rest of the resources retain their default inferred metadata values.  So... what should SUSHI do if there are 15 resources in the IG, but only 2 resources are listed in <code>sushi-config.yaml</code>?  Should it change the overall resource order and put those two resources <em>first</em>, and then follow them with the rest alphabetically?  What if you want to override the values but don't want to mess with the order?  One approach would be that if the author wants to specify a particular order, they must list <em>all</em> the resources in <code>sushi-config.yaml</code>.  On one hand, that could be tedious, but on the other hand, if an author cares about order, wouldn't they want to order <em>all</em> the resources anyway?</p>
<p>Wondering what you think about this.</p>

<p>i tend not to list the resources but do use groupings and it would be nice f the order within a group was as I specified, but it looks likes the IG doesn't allow for that because it just lists groups and then each resource declares what group it belongs to.  Does SUSHI need to take the order within a group in account as well?</p>

<p>If someone does a mix of enumerating and auto-loading artifacts, then alphabetical is the best thing to do.  If someone <em>has</em> enumerated all of their resources in a specific order, then FSH should retain that.</p>

<p>That's what I was thinking too, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>.  In the case that only <em>some</em> resources are enumerated, I don't think it makes sense to order some of the resources using user-defined order and the rest using system-defined order.  But, as you said, if they enumerate all of them, then we should assume that's the order they want.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192166">@Jean Duteau</span> -- point taken regarding alpha by ID.  When we do an alpha sort, it probably makes sense to do it by the title that is actually visible to the user on the artifact listing page.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192166">@Jean Duteau</span> -- since SUSHI does allow you to list resources by group, then I think we could retain the group-defined order when generating the IG resources list.  We'd have to experiment a bit w/ how it works -- but I think there may be something workable there.</p>

<p>I understand the issue but I believe that the best solution is in any case to allow to order the resources explicitly listed and order the remaining with default order.</p>
