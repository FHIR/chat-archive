<p>We have example instances in our IG, and I am noticing when the artifacts page is generated, the Description from the FSH doesn't make it to the description attribute in the SD. And actually, if the example is an InstanceOf a resource that has an attribute named "description" that is what is used on the artifact page.</p>
<p>As I type this, I don't know if this is a sushi thing, or perhaps a template issue? I will still start here.</p>
<p>Here is the examples section in the artifact page I am talking about:<br>
<a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/artifacts.html#13">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/artifacts.html#13</a></p>
<p>Here is our FSH file for examples:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/HL7/genomics-reporting/blob/master/input/fsh/CGExamples.fsh#L992">https://github.com/HL7/genomics-reporting/blob/master/input/fsh/CGExamples.fsh#L992</a></p>
<p>The FSH file line I am pointing to is an example of a DocRef, and you can see on the artifacts page the table has '... details about how this VCF was generated ...' but in our example, that text is only used as the text of the DocumentReference.description, but somehow makes it way into our ImplementationGuide file as the description as the <code>resource[].description</code> for this instance.</p>

<p>Actually, I might be onto something else here. We have a bit of a hodge-podge right now where we have some artifacts defined in our own IG file, and some that are not. I have been wanting to fix that anyway by just using the IG file generated by Sushi, so I tried that and it seems to have fixed this problem. Now, it introduced several other things, but I will work on those.</p>
<p>Sorry for interrupting your weekend (as I am QUITE sure Chris and Lloyd were just waiting for something to do today <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span>)</p>

<p>I see you're resolving this yourself, but for reference, to see if this is a sushi thing or a template issue, you can look in your fsh-generated directory.</p>

<p>Yup <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191380">@Elliot Silver</span> -- Of course, as soon as I post this, that thought hit me and I reviewed it, which led me down the path of 'ahhhh, maybe this is the problem'</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> - you're probably also running into this situation a bit as well: <a href="#narrow/stream/215610-shorthand/topic/instance.20title/near/266818927">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/215610-shorthand/topic/instance.20title/near/266818927</a></p>
<p>That chat talks most about <code>title</code>, but it applies to instances w/ <code>description</code> as well. As noted in the chat, we logged <a href="https://github.com/FHIR/sushi/issues/1003">SUSHI#1003</a> to reconsider this behavior.</p>
