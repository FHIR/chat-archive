<p><strong>Announcing SUSH 2.2.4</strong> with the following bug fixes and minor enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix output paths for resources with path separators in their <code>id</code> (details below)</li>
<li>Fix canonical lookups for instances whose URL was set by an <code>insert</code> rule</li>
<li>Update dependency libraries to address known vulnerabilities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vulnerability w/ Output Paths and IDs</strong></p>
<p>SUSHI generates file names based on the resource id (i.e., <code>${resourceType}-${resourceId}.json</code>). In past versions of SUSHI, if the id contained one or more path separators, it was possible to cause SUSHI to write the JSON file to other locations on the filesystem. This behavior could be abused to intentionally overwrite existing JSON files.  The utility of leveraging this bug, however, is limited by the fact that the file contents would still be a FHIR resource (i.e., you cannot force it to write arbitrary JSON).  In this version of SUSHI, the bug has been fixed by properly sanitizing file names before writing them to disk.</p>
