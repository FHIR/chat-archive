<p>I am using FHIR v 4.6.  the VS code extension does not fully recognize the resources.  It  can find SubstanceDefinition for autocompletion, but cannot find the definition or link to the documentation.   Is there a setting that needs to be set?  If not is there a date when 4.6 will be fully supported?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197370">@Catherine Hosage Norman</span>.  If I recall correctly, I think "Find Definition" only works for items you've <em>defined</em> in your own project -- so I would not expect "Find Definition" to find the R5 SubstanceDefinition.  As for the "Open FHIR Documentation" action, I think that currently only works for R4 -- but I agree that we should update it to support other versions of FHIR (R4B and R5).  I've logged this as <a href="https://github.com/standardhealth/vscode-language-fsh/issues/34">vscode-language-fsh#34</a>.  We don't currently have a date set for supporting this, as we've already planned ahead the next two weeks.  We may be able to look at it after that.</p>
<p>I expect you know this, but while the VS Code extension does not fully support FHIR 4.6.0, SUSHI does -- so this should not block development of FHIR 4.6.0 IGs.  It just means that some helpful features of the extension won't work (so you'll need to find the docs yourself, for example).</p>

<p>Chris,<br>
Thanks for the update.  I had misinterpreted the objective of "Find Definition"  I thought it would find the definition of the resource, but finding the definition of my objects  is great. My head was not there.   I have been opening the documentation in the browser; however, I like  the convenience of doing it with  vscode.</p>

<p>I really have to read through the docs on the extension.  I had no idea you could do documentation lookups with it.</p>

<p>Yeah.  But only for the core FHIR resources (and as noted above, only for R4 at the moment).</p>
