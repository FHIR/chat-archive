<p>I have a blog post about using Blockchain as a Provenance Service -- possibly using a modified FHIR Provenance resource <a href="https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2019/03/blockchain-provenance-service.html" target="_blank" title="https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2019/03/blockchain-provenance-service.html">https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2019/03/blockchain-provenance-service.html</a></p>

<p>specifically there is an extension to the Provenance.target to add an extension in Reference so that there is a Reference.hash that holds the sha256 has of the target resource (canonicalized appropriately somehow), with this hash being the way a app would discover Provenance of data they have in their hands. By hashing the data they have, and looking for that hash in the blockchain. Likely Reference.reference would not be populated so as to limit exposure of information that could be used to inappropriately re-identify</p>
