<p>In this new work stream the consent receipt is being updated in content and name in accordance with the new ISO standards and drafts as a Notice Receipt (NR). The consent receipt work was written over the last 5 years and is included as an Appendix B in the ISO 29184 Online Privacy Notices and Consent standard, which was just published in June 2020.   The work will align with  this standard and the consent receipt work in the ISO SC 27 which has announced the 27560 Consent Record Information Structure which complements ISO 29184.  The information structure in the Consent Receipt (CR) v1.1 is the starting point.   </p>
<p>Our summer project will take the need for Digital Ledger Consent (DLC) as a touchstone use case for what we are referring to as the Notice &amp; Consent Project Reference Implementation.  It will build on the existing ISO/Kantara standards (Consent Receipt 1.1 and ISO 29184) as a contribution for the next drafts and eventually the ISO 27560 Consent Record Information Structure standard.  It doing so we plan to evolve the CR 1.1 to Notice Receipt (NR) 1.2 and then NR 1.3. We than plan to share the NR as a Kantara Specification and then make then available to the wider consent and notice ecosystem.</p>
<p>We are going to make a push to put into place this work as the basis for new global standards and technologies with a reference implementation that works across and is consistent with global notice and consent efforts.  A first set of outputs will take place by July 10th (see timeline below).  We then plan to host a mid-summer workshop to  introduce these on July 15th.  Following on the workshop we plan to publish as a specification a notice structure that can be used in the DLC reference implementation.   <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=129565634">https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=129565634</a></p>

<p>This is not healthcare or FHIR specific. But it could be a foundation upon which healthcare and FHIR consents are built.</p>
