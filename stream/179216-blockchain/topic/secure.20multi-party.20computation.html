<p>(IMO) in addition to DLT, permanent contracts, git+torrent swarm, there is also another crypto scheme that might be transformative to EHR, which is secure multi-party computation (used in Zcash to anonymize transactions). The same tech can be used to do e.g. aggregate analysis on encrypted genomic data of patients, bypassing the ethical problem of having to expose one's own genome if one wishes to contribute to being sequenced but wouldn't expose oneself as much as Pinker.</p>
