<p>Hello, I'm Rob. Smart-contracts are one of the more interesting designs of blockchain usage in healthcare (actually pretty much anything that needs some sort of contract), imo. I was part of of R&amp;D brainstorm session a few years back and we were throwing ideas against the wall for blockchain use in all kinds of different situations. I've always liked the concept of a centralized record system with some sort of patient biometric private key. But all of that session was just ideas - nothing implemented. I came to the FHIR site to learn more, so I can't say I'd be able to keep up on anything Blockchain-FHIR specific. When I saw the topic though I wanted to include myself in the conversation. I really think that smart-contract and blockchain style systems are the direction many are heading in the long term for a variety of real world (read: security, fiscal) reasons. This post is really just an introduction and nothing too specific. Thanks everyone!</p>
