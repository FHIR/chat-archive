<p>"Healthcare's interoperability challenges are because of weak adoption of content, coding and communication standards; because of unclear (or absent) data governance policies/agreements; and because of poor market incentives for health data exchange (or even perverse dis-incentives against it). Sadly, blockchain technology addresses none of these."</p>

<p>The ONC InteropForum last week had a whole morning dedicated to BlockChain in Healthcare. The only takeaway I got from it was the response to my question: Given that blockchain use will be use-case specific, what healthcare use-cases have been brought before the panel members that resulted in a decision the use-case is a poor use of blockchain?  They all reacted shocked at this question. They then all declared that the clear decision they have all come to is that putting 'the' healthcare data onto the chain is a bad idea. Regardless of how it is protected. Putting pointers to the data that lives in a classic (e.g. FHIR Server) is the right solution. What the functionality of the blockchain in these cases is still use-case specific, thus not yet defined.</p>

<p>This mean that the blockchain never holds anything FHIR... but that doesn't mean that FHIR has no relevance. FHIR is critical due to the RESTful nature, as far easier to integrate with blockchain.</p>

<p>Good question... usually the smart-contract in the blockchain includes the clauses that unlock a OAuth token... Thus the access control of the FHIR Server is typical OAuth, but the rules behind issuing that OAuth token from that OAuth Authority are driven by blockchain smart-contract terms. I do outline one of these possibilities on my article in the section on Clinical Research contracts.</p>

<p>I read your piece. Am no Blockchain expert but would argue that you could do them all without blockchain in a sane way? As to the cases per se: All 8 are interesting. I'd try and qualify the first one. I think direct payment to the patient - while in some cases OK - is often problematic. I'd rather not start a philosophical debate on positive vs. negative liberty but IMO patients need professional intermediaries  to protect them from profit oriented entities and I'm not sure the blockchain &amp; the smart contract alone can handle that.  Be it a smart contract in solidity or an old school LKIF/OWL approach - there's always the semantic gap between the code and a human readable pitch your average stressed out patient will want to grasp.. an trust that someone is reviewing those contracts in their interest. I'd not go there without first sorting out how smart contracts are governed.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194020">@Gustav Vella</span>  I agree, and thought that I said those things in the article...   However, the article is there as a way to focus attention on the kinds of things blockchain 'can' be better at than elsewhere. The smart-contract and visibility of transactions is key. I think they are highlighted by this use-case.... That said, many clinical research projects do pay money for the data; they just pay it to the custodian rather than the individual. That seems to be more unethical in my view.</p>

<p>Nice article from IBM on Self-Sovereign-Identity-why-Blockchain, where they explain why no PII should go on ledger, and do explain useful things to be on the ledger -- <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2018/06/self-sovereign-identity-why-blockchain/" target="_blank" title="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2018/06/self-sovereign-identity-why-blockchain/">https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2018/06/self-sovereign-identity-why-blockchain/</a><br>
Wish it was a bit more clear on the self-sovereign-identity as being special feature of blockchain.  They fail to leverage the community of endorsements, vs some authority endorsing.</p>
