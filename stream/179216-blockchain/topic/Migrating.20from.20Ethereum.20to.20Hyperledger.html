<p>For anybody who is interested, we're migrating the Blockchain on FHIR project from Ethereum to PokitDok/Hyperledger.  After doing a lot of research, creating a test app, talking with lawyers about smart contracts, and talking with some of the Ethereum leadership; it's become apparent that Ethereum isn't a good culture fit with the healthcare industry.  We're moving to DokChain, Hyperledger, and PokitDok.  Just fyi.  </p>

<p>Hi Abigail <br>
Are Ethereum to PokitDok/Hyperledger are type of products in blockchain?</p>

<p>Yup, both different vendors in the blockchain space.  Ethereum has a larger market share and more established technology, but is focused on fintech and I see them as not having a good culture fit with healthcare organizations (similar problems as Uber has had).  PokitDok is a healthcare IT infrastructure company, and their product (called DokChain) uses the Hyperledger blockchain (from IBM/Intel, I believe).</p>

<p>Abigail: How/where can I learn more about the "The Blockchain on FHIR Project"?</p>

<p>I am not aware of any block chain on FHIR project; we are loosely discussing blockchain+FHIR here as a community exchange.  I have heard various 'product pitches' for things ...  This zulip stream is for community sharing. So if you know of something, this is a good place to share of the existence.</p>

<p>Sort of.  NucleusHealth open sourced an Ethereum based blockchain audit log.   I then extended it with FHIR resources and FHIR endpoints.  We have a sort of working Blockchain on FHIR prototype that if people were serious about testing with, we could set it up.  </p>
<p>When I was introduced to some senior Ethereum leaders to discuss issues around data modeling the AuditEvent and getting questions answered, they were very dismissive and immature and had very little interest in the healthcare industry.  They're mostly just up-and-coming fintech players trying to displace existing fintech players.  So I'm not overly optimistic that things are going to progress too much more.   </p>
<p>I did work out the details of how to make a Blockchain HIE profitable using FHIR based microtransactions billed to an insurance company.  Not fundamentally different than the UMA usecase that John described elsewhere or what Microsoft has provided in the past in their ActiveDirectory products; but I do think the blockchain smart contracts could be an important service for authentication servers that could change the interoperability landscape.     </p>
<p>But, honestly, I'm starting to think that IPFS is a more interesting technology for interoperabiility/synchronizing between locations.   </p>

<p>I'm leading a team formulating a proposed "FHIRBlocks Project": it has little to do with FHIR per se and everything to do with building an enhanced Trust model for it. The plan is to overlay OAuth2/OIDC in ways that effect an open-source inter-system mil-spec level of security and UMA. Inasmuch as I have previously exposed some elements of this blockchain-based concept to some of you a bit prematurely, we've been careful to hold back this time. Within the next few weeks , however, we hope to have something to submit here for comment.</p>
