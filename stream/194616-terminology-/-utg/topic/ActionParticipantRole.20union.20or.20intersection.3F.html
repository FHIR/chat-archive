<p>THO is getting the new warning message about unions vs. intersections on one value set. <a href="https://terminology.hl7.org/3.1.0/ValueSet-action-participant-role.html">ActionParticipantRole</a>.  It seems pretty clear to me based on the xml that it's meant to be a union rather than an intersection and thus should have two compose.includes rather than a single compose.include with multiple valuesets.  I just want to get at least a second opinion on it to make sure that I'm not missing something.  Edit to add: There's also some other issues with the value set. The version doesn't match the version in R4, it doesn't have a title element, and some other oddities...</p>

<p>If it was an intersection, it would be an empty value set.  So agree, the value set should be corrected.  Adding a title would be a good idea too...</p>
