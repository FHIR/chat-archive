<p>We are looking at Observations in the context of an A&amp;E triage. We have after long consideration decided to go with the ClinicalImpression resource for the triage itself. It will also include a number of observations, like bp. </p>
<p>When looking at the Observation resource (and bp profile) there is the observation.basedOn attribute which seems to point out if the observation was a result or part of some event. ClinicalImpression is an event type resource, but not available as one of the referenceable resource types. Is this a correct limitation? Should we use observation.partOf for this use case?</p>
<p>. partOf    ΣI  0..*    Reference(MedicationAdministration | MedicationDispense | MedicationStatement | Procedure | Immunization | ImagingStudy)    Part of referenced event</p>

<p>Can the reference go the other way?  Could you use ClinicalImpression.supportingInfo as a reference to Observation for your use case?  Maybe you can further explain what you are trying to do, but the way I think of using ClinicalImpression for the triage that would make sense.</p>
