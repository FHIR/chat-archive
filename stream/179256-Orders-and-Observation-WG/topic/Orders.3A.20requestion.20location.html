<p>Hi, could I ask for some advice where to put the Requesting Location for a ServiceRequest?  I have nice places for Receiving Location (locationReference), and a single slot for Requestor (populated with the Practitioner).   I have one system sending the Requesting Location in supportingInfo and in Extensions.  Where else could/should it be?  Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Locations are buildings and rooms.  They can't "request" anything.  I suspect you want the requesting organization.  And the way you'd do that would be to have your 'requester' be a PractitionerRole that points to both the Practitioner and the Organization.</p>

<p>Right. Yes it's the Requesting Org that is wanted.  I think the vendor doesn't have a natural mapping from their system to PractitionerRole, so that is why they are using supportingInfo to carry the Org. I see where it <em>should</em> go.  I wonder how many vendors have this challenge re PractionerRole?</p>

<p>If you wish, you can use a contained PractitionerRole that then points to the Practitioner and the Organization if there's no separate instance for the combination.</p>

<p>What does 'contained' mean here? Vendor could be creating a PractitionerRole object out of the deduced info that the Practitioner ordered this order from this Org?</p>

<p>Contained resources are described<a href="https://build.fhir.org/references.html#contained">here</a>.  The PractitionerRole object would live 'inside' the ServiceRequest.</p>

<p>Ok. My head hurt for a bit on first read of the spec and notes <span aria-label="big smile" class="emoji emoji-1f604" role="img" title="big smile">:big_smile:</span>, but I get it now. I will propose it as a better choice than extensions or supportingInfo.  Thanks!</p>
