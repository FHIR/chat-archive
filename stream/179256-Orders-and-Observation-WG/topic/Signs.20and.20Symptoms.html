<p>Reposting this question from Implementers to this group: For capturing signs and symptoms, as I follow FHIR specification, I was looking at Observation Resource. What is the appropriate observation.category value for signs and symptoms? I understand this element is extensible, but is there a value from the 9 concepts in the value set that is more appropriate than extending it using a sign and symptoms SNOMED-CT code?</p>

<p>I think exam is close but signs and symptoms can be determined via procedures too.   IRL this is all fuzzy math.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> , I am sorry, but I do not understand how signs and symptoms are determined via procedures? Can you please explain? <br>
On the other hand, would it just be better to make use of Condition resource for the signs/symptoms to circumvent this 'confusion'?</p>

<p>I'm also trying to understand how procedures would document signs/symptoms.  The procedure would document the performance of the procedure when more is needed than what an Observation would handle.  E.g., a catherization.  And then either Procedure.partOf or Observation.partOf would relate the two.  But the actual documentation of the sign/symptom would be Observation, and at some point a Condition would be created if there is a clear diagnosis, working, or rule-out in flight.</p>
<p>Within the existing list I would start with exam, but would like between OO and Pt Care determine whether we should add something to cover sign/symptom more specifically, particularly in light of the Observation/Condition boundary discussion in flight that could inform that.  I'll submit a JIRA to that end and will put in the link here.</p>

<p>Following - hard to believe - "Signs and Symptoms" or "Symptom" is not already an Observation.category concept. Given that Observation.category is not required and a decent category code is not declared in the resource, perhaps it is better to not use a category at all. For example, is there additional value derived with "Symptom: Headache" over "Headache"</p>

<p>I agree that category is definitely not required - and tends to be a Pandora's Box to figure out what, if anything, to do with it, as Eric said.  Basically, if in your application(s) for some reason you need to have a category for 'symptom' then you are free to do that (even though there isn't a code for it in the observation-category code system and value set) - and if you don't need that, then you don't need to worry about using a category at all.  If someone really wants to add 'symptom' to the observation-category code system, then that could be proposed - and I wouldn't object (just don't set your expectations too high about what it buys you).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span>  - not sure that I understand your statement re "category is definitely not required". It does offer a useful way to search for specific category of Observation data, e.g. history and physical exam related observations</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192135">@Stephen Chu</span> My point really comes down to that it depends on your definition of "useful".  I agree that it could potentially be useful if those who are creating the resource instances and those who are searching for them have agreed on and are using the same set of category coders.  But we've had really not much success in coming to agreed sets of common categories - certainly at the base resource level, anyway.  The <strong>primary</strong> use case (the original one) for 'category' is when the application or system doesn't understand the code system that is being used in 'code' - but that's a problematic situation in itself, and if possible it's much better to understand and be able to use the codes and code system properties that are used in 'code', because that's where the actual meaning of the instance is specified.  Broader types of "categories" that might be needed for analysis or other purposes can then be defined based on the sets of codes that would be applicable for those categories.</p>

<p>The existing categories seem to be process-oriented: how was the Observation captured. If the signs &amp; symptoms in question are captured in an exam, exam sounds good. </p>
<p>The term "Signs and Symptoms" is orthogonal: they can be captured in a lot of contexts. A vital sign is a sign; Complaint sounds like a symptom, and it precedes Exam. </p>
<p>To Rob's point, my impression is that Category is an ex-post-facto classification, a tag: you can assign all the tags you want and they should not be necessary to understand in order to process the resource. </p>
<p>But I don't see any language in the spec that says that. Do other WGs have language we could adopt?</p>

<p>This could be Pandora's box. If you mention "symptoms"  then I think of Adverse Event Reporting ( ICSR) and the Symptoms described in MedDRA. This is used Internationally to report to the WHO in the Uppsala Monitoring Center. There they also use a kind of category to classify the different kinds of symptoms. I don't know how this relates to your thoughts about the catergories you are thinking.</p>
