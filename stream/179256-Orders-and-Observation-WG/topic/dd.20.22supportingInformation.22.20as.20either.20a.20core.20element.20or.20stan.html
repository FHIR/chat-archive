<code>When returning a diagnostic report, it's not uncommon to reference "other" information that was not generated as part of the diagnostic process that was either used by the lab in making their determination or is provided to the ordering clinician to help with their interpretation of the results.  In genomics, this can include family history, other observations about the patient and literature references.</code></p>
<p>Why not the in DR.conclusion as free text? You could add an extension of supportinginformation.  I would propose adding new context DR.conclusion to  <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/communicationrequest-supportingInfo" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/communicationrequest-supportingInfo">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/communicationrequest-supportingInfo</a>:</p>

<p>Because we want to return an actual resource?  If they've done a RiskAssessment, they want to return that, not just a text blob.  (If all they needed was text blob, they could just embed it in narrative).  I think it should be a separate extension because the meaning is different.  request-supporting info is "additional information provided as part of the request to support the execution of the request".  This would be "additional information gathered as part of the execution of the event that may be helpful in interpreting the results of the event".  Also, I think it should live under DR directly - it's not extending the conclusion.</p>
