<p>Hi all, <br>
is it ok to use the Specimen.subject to model the recursive nature of containers or how this could be done? <br>
Thanks in advance Ralf</p>

Reference to the parent (source) specimen which is used when the specimen was either derived from or a component of another specimen.

The parent specimen could be the source from which the current specimen is derived by some processing step (e.g. an aliquot or isolate or extracted nucleic acids from clinical samples) or one of many specimens that were combined to create a pooled sample.

<p>Your suggestion is not exactly what I am looking for. My problem relates to the need to model something like a specimen is in a container who is on a tray (with a certain position), which is on a rack (with a certain position), ... (basically v2 SAC-10ff) so how to model this recursive nature (specimen in container on a tray in a rack in ...) would this needed to be done as an extension or should it be in the resource?</p>

<p>SpecimenDefinition would help, but SpecimenDefinition should be included as a possible Reference in Specimen. Since we are currently only prototyping I would like to use the SpecimenDefinition and perhaps just create an extension to Specimen to Reference it. <br>
Does anything speaks against this (except the obvious that it is from R4 draft)?</p>

<p>Ok, so this is about automated tracking.  I don't think SpecimenDefinition would be helpful here as this is about managing a specific instance, not a 'kind'.  The racks and trays would not be "specimens", so this would not be a recursive relationship.  The racks and trays are (typically reuseable) devices.  And device (now) does have a hierarchical relationship - and a location.  If Specimen.container included a Reference(Device), would that meet your needs?</p>

<p>...or extensions as you suggest which may be easier for and I wold certainly make a tracker for OO to look at this in FHIR because the specimen working group is certainly familiar with this.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191408">@Lorraine Constable</span>  ?</p>

<p>A Reference(device) in Specimen would be a great way to do it. But it should be named appropriate. I would think about something like "carrier".</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196116">@Ralf Herzog</span>, Device is used for all kinds of devices - those you're interested in but also software, complex medical devices, etc.  We don't create custom-named resources for each use-case they're used in as that would result in thousands of them.  If you choose to profile the Device resource for this specific use-case, you can name the profiles whatever you wish.  However, in the instances, the resource would still be named "Device".</p>

<p>The specimen work group is certainly familiar with this, and I understand there is a work stream focused on specimen banking use cases. Now that the domain analysis model is ready for publication, the work group intended to focus on the specimen resource(s) as the current resource is  a mixture of specimen, specimen tracking and specimen collection procedures. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span> or <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191698">@Riki Merrick</span>   are  most familiar with the project work and planned next steps</p>

<p>May I bring this topic back into use ,</p>
<p>in the context of biobanking for clinical trials we came across the question of container recursion too, but there also is a second relationship of containers : a specimen container may belong to a so called sample kit which means a composition of different sample containers belonging to one single collection.</p>
<p>So my question: Is there any ongoing work to add these relations (recursion as well as aggregation) to Specimen ?</p>
