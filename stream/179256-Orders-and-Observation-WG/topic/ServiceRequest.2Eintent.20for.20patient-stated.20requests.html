<p>When looking to use the ServiceRequest resource for representing the patient's initial request for care, we would like some input regarding which intent code to select. The code system for intent seems to include a number of aspects: who is making the request, what the requester is authorizing, who is ensuring any activity is performed, etc. The intent seems to be more than a plan and less than a directive. More than a plan since the patient authorizes an assessment of the condition, less than a directive since it is not a "legally binding instruction". Any thoughts?  I did not find examples of the resource being used for this use case.</p>
