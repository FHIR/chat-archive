<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span>  : I'm in the process of cleaning up resource proposals to get everything that is a healthcare product type resource at least to FMM 1.   I ran into DeviceUseRequest, which is effectively replaces by DeviceRequest.  That was approved by FMG a while ago, but DeviceRequest is not marked as FMM 1, and cold be higher.  So I want to as part of removing any confusion update the resource proposal (<a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/DeviceRequest+FHIR+Resource+Proposal">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/DeviceRequest+FHIR+Resource+Proposal</a>)  and then everything else to get to FMM 2-ish, but beyond changing the title, the rest is locked and a strange format.  Questions: Lloyd: Beyond changing the title, do I need to make any other updates to clarify boundaries with SupplyRequest in particular (already in progress n the build), or just get the updates agreed to already in the build, get an OO JIRA to approve adjusting the FMM to the right level based on criteria and be done (since this was DeviceUseRequest)?  Thank you!</p>

<p>If the proposal was approved you don't have to do anything</p>
