<p>Hi Guys, back in HL7 V2 when creating an order for pathology or radiology we used ORM^O01 messages here in Australia. Others may have moved to the OML^O21 message which I'm less familiar with. Regardless both had an OBR Segment and OBR-28 had a definition of: <em>This field identifies the people who are to receive copies of the results.</em>  In later V2 releases this was deprecated in favour of the PRT Segment (Participation Information Segment).</p>
<p>Regardless, I'm trying to work out how to express the equivalent concept in a FHIR order based around a ServiceRequest in R4. </p>
<p>I can see we have a ServiceRequest.performer property (0..*) where I can have many Practitioner or PractitionerRole resources, along with other types. Then there is also also a ServiceRequest.performerType property (0..1) which can express the type of performer they are, I assume. There is no example code that means "Performer to receive a copy" but I could make my own code to be clear. <br>
However, two things don't feel right to me:<br>
This does not seem like the logical place for this concept to live.<br>
Why is the ServiceRequest.performerType (0..1) when ServiceRequest.performer is (0..*)? Must there only be one type of performer and all must be of the same type?<br>
More importantly, how do I express a list of entities, primarily PractitionerRole, Practitioner or Patient entities that the requester would like a copy of the produced reports to be sent to?</p>
<p>Has anyone else tackled this issue, what other solutions might I have missed?</p>
<p>Thanks guys.</p>

<p>This is definitely worth some discussion.  I would tend to suggest putting it on the agenda for an OO on FHIR call - but that or any of our calls probably aren't at very good times for you, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191391">@Angus Millar</span>, as I believe that Tuesday at 10:00 AM EDT for OO on FHIR will be Wednesday 4:00 AM for you?</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191682">@Richard Townley-O'Neill</span>. However, we were not intending to use Composition or the document paradigm. Even if we did run with a  document and Composition for our orders it does not align with our intent. We are not trying to send extra copies of the order to the extra recipients, we want a way to communicate that the outcome or the order, e.g the diagnostic reports, be sent to the extra recipients.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span>  Google seems to tell me that Tuesday 10 AM EDT is midnight Wednesday for me in Brisbane Australia. I could make that time if the meeting is on. Can you confirm the meeting will occur and point me to connection details?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191391">@Angus Millar</span>  Well, you are right - but unfortunately I was wrong about 10:00 AM EDT.  I'm not sure what I was thinking and how I came up with that, but the actual time for the OO on FHIR call is 2:00 PM EDT (so again it would be 4:00 AM for you). :(  But in case you do want to get up really early Wednesday morning, here are the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/concalls/CallDetails.cfm?concall=57911">details</a>.  The Zoom meeting is <code>https://zoom.us/j/5100467805</code>.</p>

<p>Thanks for clarifying <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span>, 4 AM is a little brutal so I will have to see how I feel tomorrow night.</p>
