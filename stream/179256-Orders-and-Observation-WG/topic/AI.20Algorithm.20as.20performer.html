<p>Hi, I need to profile an Observation where the perfomer is an AI Algorithm and I don't find my ways around it. I thought about using Device, but from a workflow perspective indeed the  legal performer is the Algorithm itself which runs automatically through all data generated and wasn't ordered to be observed  by a practitioner. Do you have any suggestions how to resolve this?</p>

<p>A similar question was discussed <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/device-issued.20observations">here</a>. Did they come to a solution?</p>

<p>I would suggest submitting a change request to Observation asking for Device to be supported as an Observation.performer.  It's absolutely possible for the device to be the sole generator of the information, and it's a different semantic from "device used by performer to make the measurement".</p>

<p>I put in a comment on the other thread, suggesting that considering a Device as a .performer choice is not appropriate.   We have to consider that the performer is about responsibility, while the device is not.  The device was used to create the result.  The analogy with Lab would be very informative to consider where the analyzer does not become a performer.  The medical director would be documented as such.  The question is therefore for AI software as to who the medical provider is who owns managing and maintaining the software that yielded the results, ensure calibration, etc., etc. and when the results are inaccurate is held accountable.  Whether an organization or person, that is the .performer.  All else is a .device.</p>

<p>We allow Device to be responsible in other places.  A Device can perform procedures, assert Conditions, author QuestionnaireResponses and do various other things.  Saying they can't perform Observations is inconsistent with a lot of other FHIR resources.</p>

<p>Or other resources are inconsistent with Observation, so a good discussion to be had using the JIRA to help drive that to establish a consistent approach to capture the participation of a device and the responsibility of a person and/or organizaiton.</p>

<p>Probably best place to have the conversation around consistency is the workflow project.  The patterns  currently recognize Device as a <a href="http://Request.author">Request.author</a> and an Event.performer.</p>

<p>From the perspective of mapping DICOM SR to FHIR, on DICOM exists as an Observer either a Person or a Device. It is not needed that when there is a Device, there is a Person behind. If the Device creates the corresponding observations, there should be an asserter if at all, who can confirm whether the measurements created by the device are correct or not, still doesn't mean that those measurements were created by the Person.</p>

<p>I think you meant Practitioner rather than Person?  (Person is only allowed as a linking resource, never as a subject or other participant)</p>

<p>in DICOM is called Person Observer, but yes, I mean the Practitioner on a FHIR lexicon</p>

<p>Lab data in the LIS has used autoverification methods for over 20 years.  Most LISs indicate lab results are verified by the specific instrument upon which they are performed (due to accreditation requirements).  In FHIR, would expect the performer of the result/observation would be the unique identifier for the instrument/device to meet accreditation requirements.  Suspect a similar approach can be taken with other "AI" especially in cases where FDA regulates them.</p>
