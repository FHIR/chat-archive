<p>We want to specify whether the oxygen saturation was measured under oxygen gas administration or nor, and if yes, what was the inhaled oxygen flow rate value. Therefore we want to relate oxygen saturation (LOINC 2708-6) to  inhaled oxygen flow rate (3151-8).<br>
What is the best option for that?<br>
1) Observation oxygen saturation (2708-6) . hasMember -&gt; Observation inhaled oxygen flow rate (3151-8)<br>
2) Observation oxygen saturation (2708-6) . derivedFrom -&gt; Observation inhaled oxygen flow rate (3151-8)<br>
Thanks for your advices.</p>

<p>I wouldn't use either.  "hasMember" is more about organizing Observations into groups/panels.  And you didn't calculate the saturation based on the flow rate.  Instead, I would capture the flow rate as a component of the saturation because the saturation should always be read/interpreted knowing what the flow rate was.</p>

<p>The possible issue I see with that is that the flow rate is a completely independent (standalone) observation that could easily (and likely would be) interpreted and used without necessarily even knowing or caring that the oxygen saturation was being measured.  In this case it is likely a separate recording of the flow rate for the specific purpose of interpreting the O2 saturation results, so maybe that sufficiently pushes it toward being a reasonable use of component?</p>

<p>If it's something we'd expect to be captured on its own, then perhaps we need a new relationship type (at least as an extension)?</p>

<p>We raised the question because the case is borderline and does not fit in any of the options described in <a href="http://build.fhir.org/observation.html#obsgrouping" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/observation.html#obsgrouping">http://build.fhir.org/observation.html#obsgrouping</a><br>
These two observations are produced and recorded independently as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span>  says, and they do not fulfill the rule "same method, same device, same observation", which excludes using component.<br>
However the value of saturation cannot be interpreted without knowing the value of flow rate, as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  says, and we are not in the situation of a panel of two observations, which excludes hasMember.<br>
The oxygen saturation is not strictly derived from the inhaled flow rate in that sense that it is not a calculation nor a direct interpretation, but could we say that it is influenced by the flow rate, and consider this as a kind of loose derivation?</p>

<p>This could be an extension, as Lloyd mentioned, but it is something that 100% (or very nearly so) of systems that exchange this data need to deal with.  So ultimately whatever solution we settle on should be (or become) core.</p>

<p>I think the starting point would be core extension.  We could look at moving that to a new "related" type in the future once we have a better sense that: a) the extension meets our needs; and b) the extension is widely supported</p>

<p>in the case of O2 Sat, the actual measurement value is "influenced by" the O2 that is being administered (based on the flow rate) and the interpretation and use of that result is dependent on having that information recorded and available at the time of interpretation</p>

<p>it's something to consider - at first I thought it might be a better choice - but again in the case of O2Sat, if you somehow didn't have the O2 flow rate recorded you might be able to make some use of the measurement (you would be likely assuming it was on room air), but having the O2 flow rate information allows the interpretation to be <strong>more</strong> accurate and <strong>more</strong> useful<br>
so I think it's actually "supporting information" - which we already have in the supportingInfo extension (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/workflow-supportingInfo" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/workflow-supportingInfo">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/workflow-supportingInfo</a>)</p>

<p>Thanks for reminding me that I voted for that, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span>. :)  In my first response I did say that with the likelihood of separately recording the flow rate specifically for this purpose that "maybe that sufficiently pushes it toward being a reasonable use of component?"  So I'm not unalterably opposed to that approach.  But I do think that the flow rate actually is "supporting information".</p>

<p>I don't think that the flow rate is a "precondition" for the O2Sat measurement (it's just a fact that is, not a precondition for it).  Since it's a gray area and the US Core/Argonaut approach isn't wrong (especially considering the separate recording aspect), it might be compelling to align with that.</p>

<p>But the precondition extension certainly has valid uses - we just may have not described it optimally and didn't choose a good example.  Fasting status (e.g. for glucose) actually is a precondition for that measurement, but we called that out separately in Specimen.  And in lab preconditions actually should (always?) apply at the time of the specimen collection, I think.  So we may want to do some reconsideration on that extension (or leave it alone and see if anyone ever uses it and complains).</p>

<p>Maybe to something like what is described for LOINC 1504-0 "Glucose [Mass/​volume] in Serum or Plasma --1 hour post 50 g glucose PO".  The observation that  50 g glucose was administered orally 1 hour prior to specimen collection would be a precondition.</p>

Are you saying that the Argonaut approach of using component is not what we want to use? Help me understand why that will not work well and it would be better to push people to use supportingInfo? I can think of many situations where an observation of the environment has an impact on the primary observation even (as we should do) focusing this specifically on observations where we typically do state important environmental/concomitant observations such as fasting state, inspired O2, and orientation of the patient. So if we decide in these situations we should take a particular approach, let's <strong>please</strong> make sure it's done consistently and with a good justification.</p>

1:  "component is used for any supporting result that cannot reasonably be interpreted and used outside the scope of the Observation it is a component of." The inspired O2 may be interpreted outside the scope of the oxygen saturation, although the other way round is not true.<br>
2: "Components should only be used when there is only one method, one observation, one performer, one device, and one time.". The inhaled O2 is using a different device and a different method from the oxygen saturation.</p>

<p>OK so i concede that the language in the spec should be updated to reflect usage.   We have several structures to link observations and some are more tightly bound than others.   I agree that it would be nice to do it one way.  But everybody thinks their way is best.  which why there are so many standards out there.</p>

<p>to Lloyd's question, it certainly can be a separate observation - and it's required for accurately clinically interpreting and acting on the O2 saturation measurement, so logically it's "supporting information" and the two observations (or components) need to be reported together (linked with workflow-supportingInfo or hasMember, or as components)</p>

<p>I see "real world usage" as still in the beginning of the FHIR learning curve. My feeling is that the best practises on FHIR are still ahead of us rather than behind.  For this reason, rather than relaxing the wording in the specification I would strengthen  the existing guidelines, which already imply a non-ambiguous path for linking observations: </p>
<ul>
<li>Observation is part of a panel (e.g. CBC, urinalysis, serum electrolyte...)? Use hasMember</li>
<li>Observation  performed as a single action (same  time, method, device) produces an array of values (e.g. arterial pressure)? Use component</li>
<li>Observation is derived by computation or interpretation of a set of observations, images,  docs (e.g.  trisomy 21 likelihood in fetus derived from echography and beta HCG free)? Use derivedFrom</li>
<li>Observation result should be interpreted in light of  another independant observation (oxygen saturation, knowing inhaled oxygen flow rate)? Use the workflow-supportingInfo core extension.<br>
A more explicit and clearer specification may impact existing pioneer implementations like Argonaut in the US.  But is it a sufficient reason for not improving the spec?</li>
</ul>

<p>O2 flow and O2 sat are usually among other results reported in blood gas panels.  (Not sure if this is Francois's use case?)  There may be other observations such as whether the patient is on room air or nasal cannula, PEEP, BIPAP, and other vent settings that repiratory provides the laboratory with the blood gas order.  When the gas is run, these items are entered as results in the panel that is reproted back to teh ordering provider as they provide important clinical results/information for this critical care test.</p>
