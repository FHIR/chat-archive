<p>Apologies for the cross-post, but this didn't seem to get any traction in implementers, and figured this would be the next place to ask.  Currently, <code>Device</code> is not allowed in <code>Observation.performer</code>.  Given that, how would you record "AI Algorithm X" performed an Observation? (e.g., AI analysis of an Imaging Study)?</p>

<p>I'd be in favor of a change request to extend Observation.performer.  There are definitely Devices that perform (and have sole responsibility for) certain Observations.  I don't think the fear of confusion between Observation.performer and Observation.device is a valid reason to omit it.</p>

<p>It's two different devices.  "What made the decision" vs. "what was used".  You can't stick both in the same element because they mean different things.  Implementers get confused about lots of things.  Our job is to create the needed elements and make it as obvious as we can how to do the right thing.  We don't "not" include needed capabilities because we're concerned about confusion.</p>

<p>If the intent of device as a performer is to indicate what/who made the decision, I can understand that distinction.  Problem will remain where to shift from was used into performed.  Do you see that if a machine deducted a result (whether simple lab result, or some AI algorithm) that that observation is performed by a device and then a human indicates whether it can be used?  whether they acted on it?  Is the lab tech the performer, or "just" the operator?</p>

<p>There are multiple workflows.  In general if a human decides whether the value exposed, then human has responsibility.  However, if the device has sole responsibility for both determining the value and deciding the Observation is going to be added to the patient record, then that's definitely the performer.</p>

<p>I think it lowers confusion.  If a practitioner <em>uses</em> a device, the practitioner is the performer and the device is just a device used.  The change is to allow the case when there is no practitioner directly involved in the workflow - e.g., organization ABC uses an AI system to perform initial (or secondary, etc.) observations.  The practitioner has no input into what is run, it's just part of the workflow.</p>
<p>You could make the argument that some sort of organization or person should be listed as the 'one who decided this step in the workflow', but I don't think it is reasonable (or likely) that it would be filled out (read: most people have no idea who made the decision).</p>

<p>and I don't see any mention in this thread of autoverification rules where most LISs indicate which (especially when multiple) instrument "reported" an autoverified result.  Knowing which instrument is also a regulatory requirement (for traceback/root cause analysis).  How is this requirement met?</p>

<p>Devices absolutely make decisions and perform things without human supervision.  They do that under the auspices of an Organization, but you definitely want to be able to list the Device as the performer.</p>

<p>Performer and 'device' are different things.  If a Device is the thing that is <em>responsible</em> for making the Observation without supervision, then it's the performer - just as a device can be the author of a condition or performer of a procedure or author of a QuestionnaireResponse.  Observation shouldn't handle the situation any differently.  Doing so creates discrepancy and confusion.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="222054">@Gino Canessa</span>  actually for lab data, there's regulatory requirements to know exactly which device (unique id/serial number if multiples of the same model are used in a lab), a particular result originated from.  It's helpful for troubleshooting, root cause analysis and FDA I think requires it for any investigations that may lead to recalls, etc.  For COVID reporting, HHS wants the UDIs for the analyzer (device) and test kits (device) used to generate the lab results. <br>
Not quite the same as an algorithm/AI produced result, but since many "algorithms" are essentially calculations, calculations need to be validated according to lab regulatory requirements too (usually before they go into use  and when inspected.)</p>
