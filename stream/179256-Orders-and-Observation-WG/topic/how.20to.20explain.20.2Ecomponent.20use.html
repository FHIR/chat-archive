<p>Some comments have been received expressing that Observation.component should not be used. Yet the IG was designed following the rules of when .component is allowed to be used. (see <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-35612">FHIR-35612</a> ). There are three Observation profiles in the radiation dose IG that really do need to use .component as the values recorded are not useful on-their-own. How should the fact that the IG was properly designed to properly use .component be expressed so that the reader understands that the use of .component was not improper? Do we need to have a pattern of narrative explanation that is used consistently by all to indicate that they have properly designed the use of .component?</p>
