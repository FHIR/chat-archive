<p>Hello, I want to perform a query to fetch some <code>ServiceRequest</code> and I would like to include the <code>insurance</code>. The problem is there is no search parameter for <code>insurance</code> and I would like to make this query without making a second request to the server. <code>insurance</code> was excluded from the search parameters for some particular reason? thanks</p>

<p>insurance was added fairly recently and I expect no one had thought about searching on it.  Feel free to submit a change request proposing the addition.  In the meantime, you can define a custom SearchParameter</p>
