<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: As I understand, this should be posted in the Implementers stream, and not in the WG stream. I have <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Defining.20and.20storing.20Individual.20referenceRange.20for.20patients/near/214147438">now cross posted it</a>, and cannot find a way to delete it from this stream. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>We are working on a solution for <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD011682/AIRWAYS_self-management-interventions-including-action-plans-patients-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease">self-management plan for patients</a> - a concept for empowering patients to take actions based on their actual condition. </p>
<p>In this concept we need to define and store individual refrence values for patients. E.g. for COPD patients, the patient should take specific actions if the saturation is below a certain threshold/reference value. The value needs to be individual to the patient, since the patient will have actual values that are way out of any standard reference ranges. </p>
<p>We are currently struggling to find in which FHIR-resource this kind of information should be best stored. Any input on this?</p>
<p>In an actual observation, I would imagine that this information is a natural part of the ReferenceRange. But we are here looking for a concept to store the "individual referenceRange" for the patient.</p>
