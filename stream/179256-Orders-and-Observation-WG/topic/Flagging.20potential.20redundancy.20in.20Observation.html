<p>We are implementing a lung cancer screening app, which will collect answers to several questions. Some of these answers might be inferred from or represented in other resources, if and when those resources are available, but we need to send the Observations irrespective of that availability. We don't, however, want to repeat information without clear indication that there is repetition.</p>
<p>So, for instance, the "size of highest risk nodule" observation might also employ the "derivedFrom" relationship to an ImagingStudy. </p>
<p>The problem we face is that some observations represent information in resources not included in the "derivedFrom" scope. </p>
<p>Next scan timeframe: this may be represented in a ServiceRequest<br>
Provider notification: this may be represented in a Communication</p>
<p>Would this be the place to use the relatedArtifact extension?  supportingInfo?</p>
