<p>Both Medication and Substance behave as both 'kind' and 'instance' - and it would be problematic (and unnecessary) to change that.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> : there needs to be recognition that when a resource intends to cover both an actual instance (albeit not always fully populated with all relevant identifiers to clearly make it so, thus somewhat kind-ish) and a definition/kind, that one always knows which context that resource is expected to be used in as the context that it is actually being used in (as referenced already or not yet) is not always present, and that during that resource instance's life cycle the meaning does not change, e.g., a resource that started as a definition suddenly gets a serial number and has become an instance.  That needs some sort of flag, or boolean, or unambiguous absence or presence of certain data that never can change (immutable).  Use cases that indicate they don't care are actually in the instance space with fuzzy/kind-ish identification.  Those working with definitions would not suddenly want to change them mid-stream to instances as references that expect them in definition context would become problematic.  For Substance it is o.k. to have one resource supporting both, but then it must be possible to unambiguously and immutably indicate what it represents.  Relying on profiling is not strong enough.  Absence/presence of certain data is not strong enough.  Only an immutable flag/boolean is.  And you can default as appropriate (mostly instance as reality is that there are many more instance instances than definition instances).</p>

<p>Most systems working with medications and substances today don't differentiate and don't need to.  You could certainly profile in your space to make it mandatory.  However, given that many (most?) systems today don't know/don't care, FHIR certainly can't make such a concept mandatory.  In many spaces the same resource instance can be pointed to as both kind (e.g. by the order) and instance (e.g. by the dispense).   And that works just fine.</p>

<p>Default values aren't allowed.  You can have "meaning if missing".  But in this case, if I have a Medication instance and I don't know/care whether it represents a kind or an instance (and might be used in both context), it needs to be exposed in FHIR that way.</p>

<p>A boolean can state yes or no, and if you dont know/care you dont use it. Are you saying there must be a way to positively state that we don't know? Also, if meaning if missing is a concept, why is that unable to work here?</p>

<p>I'm saying I'd be happier with an optional code.  Most environments can't handle an 'unknown' boolean.</p>

<p>A boolean is easier for people to grasp I would say. If there cannot be a default - or a meaning if missing (I'm unclear what role that plays) - then there is true (it's an instance), false (it's not, so it's a kind/definition) and no value, if it's not present, no statement is made about what it is. Is there a reason that that doesn't work?</p>

<p>The reference implementations can't generally distinguish once the data has been parsed whether a boolean was present with false or absent entirely.  So 'code' is really the only way to go to maintain the distinction safely.</p>

<p>That's not true of most of them, but it is true of some implementations</p>
