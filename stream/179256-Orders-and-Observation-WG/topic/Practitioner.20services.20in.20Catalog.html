<p>New FHIR R4 introduces several new resources to implement a service catalog. It seems to cover lab diagnostics quite well but I have some questions about services performed by a practitioner. </p>
<p>I need the ability to link practitioner services (procedure codes) in the service catalog of organization with practitioners which can perform these procedures. We have some ideas but none of them seems to fit this task:<br>
1. The catalog is the profile above composition and composition have field subject. We could have the full catalog with subject reference to organization and subsets of this catalog with the subject reference to practitioner role. But the subject field is restricted in catalog profile, so we dropped this idea.<br>
2. We can reference HealthcareService from a CatalogEntry but HealthcareService is no longer a definition from a workflow point of view (<a href="http://build.fhir.org/workflow.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/workflow.html">http://build.fhir.org/workflow.html</a>). And we think that each orderable position of a catalog should be a definition to fit workflow pattern. </p>
<p>So is there any other approach to link practitioner services (procedure codes) in the catalog with practitioners?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191367">@Brian Postlethwaite</span> ?  Would it be reasonable to define an extension on HealthcareService for this?</p>
