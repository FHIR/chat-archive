<p>And the last from me (at this time).</p>
<p>The focus of the session might be best on the design of the tracks - though happy to go with whatever people want.</p>
<p>I've been trying to do the R4 upgrade for both Logical Modeller and conman (as the 2 go together quite nicely) but it's very much as work in progress and needs testing (hint :) ) Seems to be working...</p>
<p>This could even be done on the the friday session. An iterative process of:<br>
1. create a track<br>
2. add the scenarios<br>
3. quickly create graphs for each scenario (references and text only)<br>
4. review - does this work?<br>
5. modify as required,</p>
<p>With the output being polished tracks. After all, the building of graphs against those tracks can be done any time and anywhere - and (unlike the scenario builder) anyone can view any of the graphs...</p>
