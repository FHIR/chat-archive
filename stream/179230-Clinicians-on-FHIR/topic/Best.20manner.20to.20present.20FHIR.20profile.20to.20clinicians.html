<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>This is a question somewhat pertaining to clinfhir's tools but I'm keeping it general. What is the best way to present FHIR profile content to clinicians for verification that it covers their clinical needs? <br>
The cancer interoperability group would like to show a profile like <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/StructureDefinition-oncology-EstrogenReceptorStatus.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/StructureDefinition-oncology-EstrogenReceptorStatus.html">EstrogenReceptorStatus</a> and all the attributes it contains to clinicians. The structure definiton rendering in a FHIR IG can be a lot to take in as a clinician not used to looking at things like that.  Are there any tools people have found effective for this?</p>

<p>Hi Travis - as you indicate, it's something that we've been working on with CF - so would be interested on others opinions! I'm actually working on a re-write at present with a view to making it easier to show and collect this data in the context of a connectathon. First outing will be at an INTEROPen event we're holding in London after the May WGM (and some review at the WGM itself).  I did a quick video yesterday to show progress - feel free to take a look and give me any feedback...   <a href="https://vimeo.com/263774117" target="_blank" title="https://vimeo.com/263774117">https://vimeo.com/263774117</a>   (Note that this particular variant is for building a scenario with core types. - there's another I'm working on that will be based on a profile (I'll probably convert to a Logical Model first)...</p>
