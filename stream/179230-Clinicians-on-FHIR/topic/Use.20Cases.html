<p>Hi all,<br>
Unfortunately, we didn't get over to Koln this week.  But I thought we would try to contribute a bit by doing an iteration on the Clinicians on FHIR use cases.  If anybody is interested, we've been putting the use cases into a single document, and fleshing it out with narrative, cast of characters, workflow steps, adding a bit of professional graphic design, etc.   </p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Ch3YQjpzxg0kPn-BSm2LbBotpwbThfO/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Ch3YQjpzxg0kPn-BSm2LbBotpwbThfO/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Ch3YQjpzxg0kPn-BSm2LbBotpwbThfO/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>We've actually been running these by our interns, hackathon members, startup members, etc.  They've been quite useful in herding cats; and it just seemed that polishing them up into a brochure that can be handed out at hackathons and such would make sense.  </p>
<p>These should be generally aligned with the spreadsheets/worksheets that have been handed out at previous working groups.  The intent is to harmonize any discrepancies.  We have some interns who are busy flowcharting them as well; so we'll hopefully be able to soon break them out into individual use cases brochures, comprising: visualization, narrative, cast of characters, workflow, flowchart, and worksheet.  </p>
<p>I can rebrand the documents with FHIR logo if that's of interest.  We've also been doing a dozen more, including blockchain usecases, medical home use cases, etc.  But for now, I thought I'd start off by sharing the Clinician on FHIR usecases we've been working on.  <br>
Abigail</p>

<p>I'd be interested in fitting these into what clinFHIR conman thinks of as tracks/scenarios... (  <a href="/user_uploads/10155/WPqtlSMBP3VEGX-N9M3io5hp/clinFHIR-ConMan.pptx" target="_blank" title="clinFHIR-ConMan.pptx">I've attached</a> a short ppt I did to explain it). Can always modify clinFHIR of course!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191321">@David Hay</span> Are you going to be at DevDays?  I just got on a train to Boston and am catching up on old conversations.  Would be happy to discuss harmonizing our use cases with clinFHIR.</p>
