<p>Some notes of using the Graph builder part of conman</p>
<ul>
<li>After selecting the Graph Builder tab, select the scenario of interest from the dropdown to the upper left</li>
<li>You can import an existing graph using the 'import' link just below the scenario dropdown. Useful if the scenarios in the track represent the evolution of a single scenario over time - eg a careplan being updated - or if someone has created a nice graph and you want to adapt that.]</li>
<li>Add a new resource instance from the palette to the upper right. Can be Core types, logical models or profiles (profile support is very new)</li>
<li>The page is in 2 panes<ul>
<li>the left pane is selects an instance (with a couple of other functions)</li>
<li>the right pane is the editor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The left (instance selected) pane:<ul>
<li>Use the list to see instances in a table - also shows references from each instance, has a link to the spec (if a core type) and has a delete link for both references and the instance itself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>the right (editor) pane:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the table view for editing the instance (adding data etc)</p>
<ul>
<li>The &gt; to the left hides/shows child elements from a Backbone element</li>
<li>The + symbol in column 2 will duplicate the selected element (if multiple) - including any children. The 'collapse' link at the upper right is useful to hide everything except the topmost elements - kind of a tidy up link.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the Tree view to look at a populated instance</p>
<ul>
<li>elements with data against them are in green bold. Selecting it shows the json data to the right</li>
<li>the 'toggle hide empty' link to the upper right hides/shows empty elements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>the 'resource instance tab:</p>
<ul>
<li>shows the complete json instance (including the most recent validation that was performed (Note that the hapi validation seems to get confused when validating coding - don't know why, and still seems to save OK)</li>
<li>has a validation link to validate the resource against the data server</li>
<li>also has a tree view (not sure which tree view is the best one)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
