<p>Hi Everyone! My name is Inèz Sikkel and I'm a Medical Informatics student. For my internship I'm doing a small study on how HL7 FHIR can be used to semantically map clinical (research) data. I would like to Interview experts who have already tried to map data with FHIR. I am specifically interested in how FHIR was implemented (what servers, resources were used). Where the mapping was used for and if you succeeded.</p>
<p>The questions are the following:</p>
<p>1. How did you use FHIR to map clinical data?<br>
2. In what setting did you use FHIR? Data extraction, consents, recruitment, data standardization, device integration <br>
3. How was FHIR implemented? Has your organization a FHIR server integrated? <br>
4. What FHIR resources did you use?<br>
5. Is the FHIR mapping still used? <br>
6. What would you recommend for a new organization to use FHIR?<br>
It shouldn't take more than <strong>15 minutes</strong>. Is anyone available for a phone call/zoom call next week?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="201404">@Inèz Sikkel</span> Have you looked at the OMOP on FHIR work done at Georgia Tech?  <a href="http://omoponfhir.org/" target="_blank" title="http://omoponfhir.org/">http://omoponfhir.org/</a></p>
