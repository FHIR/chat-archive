<p>Welcome to the Student Track 2018 Boston! My name is Lilian Minne and I'm coordinating this year's Student Track. If you are planning to join us, please introduce yourself here. Let me start: I'm a FHIR consultant at Firely. My main tasks at Firely are: supporting customers all over the world in applying the FHIR standard to their use cases, supporting our internal team in the development of Vonk, Forge and Simplifier and creating the Profiling Academy. In my free time I love to travel around the globe, enjoy sports like tennis, horse riding and Zumba or go out for a good meal in a good restaurant.</p>

<p>Hello hello. My name is Fabian Junge, I am studying computer science at the University of Illinois, and I do not have nearly as much information nor interesting facts to list as Lilian does.</p>
