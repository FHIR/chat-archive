<p>This stream is for those who are learning/using FHIR as part of their course-work to meet, chat and work through problems with other students.  Feel free to post questions elsewhere.  We'll look to the students for guidance as to how actively you want the rest of the FHIR community to engage in monitoring/answering questions here.</p>
