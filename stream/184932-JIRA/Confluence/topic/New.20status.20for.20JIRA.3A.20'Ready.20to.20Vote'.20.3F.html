<p>I know there are other ways to handle this, but does anyone else believe there is value in a new status for <code>Ready To Vote</code>? Perhaps it is just related to how I try to manage our backlog in JIRA, but I often want to distinguish JIRAs that have a legit resolution proposed and are ready to vote on. We use the Grouping's to manage this today, but I wonder if a status would be better?</p>

<p>Definitely use Groupings.  There'd be a very large amount of work involved in adding this as a status, and given that screens and transitions wouldn't be any different, and filtering by grouping is straight-forward, it'd be hard to justify the change.</p>

<p>I don't know that I would argue that filtering by grouping is straight-forward. I suppose it is once you figure out the right pattern, but there are some tricks to it that must be applied to every query and filter you setup. Ultimately, preparing something for a vote seems like a key part of the overall workflow, so therefore having a status just makes sense to me. I have worked in plenty of change control systems (almost all of them actually) that are configured with a status that clearly says "hey everyone, this is ready to review" rather than needing to interpret it by looking at other meta data. It could also be used as an additional validation point as we try to improve our usage of JIRA.</p>
<p>But if I am the only one who thinks so, and it is very possible that I am, it isn't worth a large amount of work.</p>

<p>Oh, and not to mention, when you ask people to use meta-data for important things like this, and that meta-data is simple free text name/value pairs, you end up with a cluttered system:</p>

<p>Yes, the fact that Groupings can be defined at will is a mixed blessing.  (The fact they're case-sensitive is just an outright curse <span aria-label="frown" class="emoji emoji-1f641" role="img" title="frown">:frown:</span>)<br>
If we were going to add <em>anything</em>, it would be a distinct boolean element that said 'ready-for-vote'.  That would be significantly less effort than messing with the state machine.</p>

<p>The boolean thing would help me, but not sure it is worth it. If I am the only one asking for it, please don't worry about it and I will continue to live with it. It isn't a terrible experience, I just felt it could be better.</p>

<p>Happy to see other people's thoughts.  One of my concerns is that we'll end up with people using two different mechanisms to accomplish the same thing.</p>
