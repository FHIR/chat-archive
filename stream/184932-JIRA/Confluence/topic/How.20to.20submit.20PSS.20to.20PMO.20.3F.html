<p>Unsure what stream is appropriate for this question. I'm trying to understand how a PSS gets from a state of approved by WG to reviewed by TSC. <br>
This step from <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=111117157">https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=111117157</a> -- <br>

<p>This same step PSS from WG approval to TSC is also documented (slightly differently) here: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/A+-+Project+Proposal+and+Project++Scope+Statement">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/A+-+Project+Proposal+and+Project++Scope+Statement</a></p>

<p>I went ahead and emailed <a href="mailto:pmo@hl7.org">pmo@hl7.org</a> yesterday, but haven't heard back yet (no doubt b/c it was the wrong thing to do).</p>

<p>Continuing investigation, I think perhaps that TSC's workqueue for PSS approval requires PSS's to have a linked, approved? Project Proposal, per these instructions: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/How+to+Create+a+Project+Scope+Statement+in+JIRA#HowtoCreateaProjectScopeStatementinJIRA-Step-by-stepguide-LinkingtoaProjectProposal">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/How+to+Create+a+Project+Scope+Statement+in+JIRA#HowtoCreateaProjectScopeStatementinJIRA-Step-by-stepguide-LinkingtoaProjectProposal</a></p>
<p>Meaning that someone must manually link these two records before TSC can/will see the PSS, regardless of the status of the sponsoring WG's approval.</p>

<p>I'm mistaken, above, the next step after a WG approval is that the WG changes the status of the PSS ... <strong>but also</strong> finalizes a jira sub-task. Per guidance from HQ:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>1)  Scroll down to sub-tasks
2)  Click on the Patient Care subtask
a.  Click “Approve”
b.  Enter the date the WG approved the PSS, and in the comments enter the link to the minutes where the vote to approve took place
</code></pre></div>
<p>I'd bet that the ability to click "Approve" is limited to co-chairs. It's unclear if the Project Proposal needed to be linked at all.</p>

<p>I don't know what the <em>right</em> process is.  But the reliable and efficient process is "email Anne Wizauer".  She manages the TSC agenda, evotes, etc.</p>

<p>Thanks, Lloyd. Anne actually emailed <strong>me</strong> today, because she has a heart of gold, I think.</p>

<p>Looks like it is sorted out.  I'll follow up tomorrow to see if there was an issue with the Jira Workflow.  It should have transitioned to Consensus Review as soon as the Patient Care sub-task was transitioned to "Agreed".</p>

<p>Hey Melva, just fyi, the issue was that the PC subtask never got created at all. Rather, once the WG voted to approve, that vote was recorded by changing the status of the PSS to "WG Approved". As an additional or alternative solution to general education (i.e. WGs need to create a subtask following WG Approval), could merging the WG Approval and Consensus-Review workflow steps work?</p>
