<p>After resolving all other errors, I am getting this error on the first row of the spreadsheet. I am wondering where I can add the workgroup name in the spread sheet </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ERROR: 78. Error processing row 3.  Unable to feedback issue triage.
All prior rows loaded correctly and have been removed from the spreadsheet.
For this row, the issue and ballot vote were successfully created, but there was an error in triaging the row.
riage will need to be performed manually to set the comment, resolution and/or resolution description.  Please remove this row, then resubmit the spreadsheet.  Error details:
customfield_11400: Work Group is required.
</code></pre></div>
<p>The other issue is that the spreadsheet complains about repetitive comment summary when the comment is <code>typo</code>.  I tried all the permutations <code>'Typo'</code>, <code>"Typo"</code> but I still get the complaint.</p>

<p>Have you moved the spreadsheet from the truncated set of columns that are present in the submission spreadsheet to the 'full' spreadsheet that includes triage information, including the work group?</p>

<p>I don't think so. I am using the ballot spreadsheet submitted by the commenters. How should I change the spreadsheet to full version? I am following the instructions here but I don't see that --or I'm missing it:<br>

<p>That bit's new.   The 'new' spreadsheet format is for balloters to make it easier to load their content.  Co-chairs still need to import using the 'old' format.  Grab one of the spreadsheets associated with a previous ballot and copy the content across into the appropriate columns of one of those old-style spreadsheets.  The documentation hasn't been updated because that step is new.  (And after this cycle, it hopefully won't be relevant anymore.)</p>
