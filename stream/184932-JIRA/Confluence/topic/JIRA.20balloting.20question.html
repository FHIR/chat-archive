<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> I think I heard you say yesterday that once balloting moves to JIRA that WGs can resolve submitted issues even before the ballot closes. Given voters can vote on other people's issues and  that a lot of comments come in towards the end of the ballot period, it seems like it might be inefficient to close issues before the ballot ends (others may have the same concerns but different use cases or points of view). Will it be a best practice for WGs to not resolve issues during the ballot period?</p>

<p>In FHIR, work groups resolve issues as they come in, whether voted on or not.  Other people adding their vote weight to an issue doesn't really add any new 'perspective'.  The way to add perspective is to comment on the issue.  I, personally, have not seen an upsurge in people commenting on existing issues during the ballot period, so it's not clear there's any reason to treat that period of time differently from any other.</p>

<p>Can you comment on a resolved issue?</p>

<p>Only if you're a manager.  Reason being that work groups typically don't look at issues once they're resolved.  If you have a concern about a resolved issue, you raise a new one.</p>
