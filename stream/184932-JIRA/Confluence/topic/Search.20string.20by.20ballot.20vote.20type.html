<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> What do you mean by "search by negative vote"?  Do you mean "search for all things that have a negative vote recorded against them"?  If so, we don't have that (yet).  We do have this: <code>issueFunction in InBallot("2019-Sep - FHIR IG CDex R1 STU", "NEG")</code> which lets you find those issues that have outstanding negative votes for the specified ballot.  If need be, I could possibly modify that function so it could just take InBallot("NEG") or possibly even InBallot() which could find all issues that were referenced in a ballot of some sort whether affirmative or negative.  Let me know what you'd actually use and I'll see what I can do...</p>

<p>I think that the issueFunction query is what I was looking for thanks</p>
