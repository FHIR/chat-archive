<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="225094">@Debi Willis</span> and I seem to have disconnected from the world of auto-flowing calendar invites.  As Debi describes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have all kinds of HL7 calendar invites that flow automatically into my calendar even if they're not something I have the bandwidth to do, e.g. all the co-chair calls, as much as I'd love to.  They arrive via the co-chairs list.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I no longer get any invites automatically to my own PE Workgroup meetings, including the ones I chair.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are we doing wrong?</p>
<p>Related question: should we be going through the duplicate effort of maintaining listings on our own calendar page in Confluence, as well as on <a href="http://HL7.org/concalls">HL7.org/concalls</a>?</p>

<p>You <em>must</em> maintain your calls on <a href="http://hl7.org/concalls">hl7.org/concalls</a>.  That's what triggers the announcement and is the primary (consistent) source for HL7 participants to see what's scheduled, when.  Keeping call information on Confluence as well isn't required, but is useful because I think call information on the HL7 website is only available if you're logged in.</p>
