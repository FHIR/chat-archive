<p>What gos in the Ballot column?  It started out as the the Ballot name  "2020-FEB - QMEXCHANGE R1 STU"  and then I tried what was in the <code>FHIR_Ballot_def_202001</code> file ,  "2020-Feb-&gt;QMEXCHANGE R1 STU", to  "2020-Feb-FHIR-us-davinci-deqm" now I am at a loss.   UPdate it is 2020-Feb - QMEXCHANGE R1 STU which is nowhere in the ballot desktop and exists only in JIRA under the arcane search: project = "Ballot Definition"</p>

<p>The ballot column should be "2020-Feb - QMEXCHANGE R1 STU".  The Ballot Definition is the source of truth here.  It gets populated via a transformation from the ballot desktop, the objective of which is to make the names at least slightly less cryptic.</p>
<p>Brett was able to successfully load on his own because, for some reason, he's listed as a Jira Administrator.  The ballot import process is requiring administrator privileges even though it shouldn't.  (Gave up digging into why after about a half day at the connectathon.)  If you send me your sheet Eric, I'll load it.  (Just double-check that all of your rows have summaries and either artifacts or pages because sometimes that check doesn't process until after it gets past the security check - again, not sure why.)</p>

<p>Yes, but the longer term plan is to have balloters load their own spreadsheets and "use a PC" may not be a viable solution for all balloters.  Granted, they can just post to Jira in the usual way, but if we can make changes to the generated spreadsheets that make them "Mac-friendly", that would be better.  (As well, I'm generating spreadsheets for the reconciliation sheets and I'm wondering if those have Mac issues too?)</p>

<p>I don't know if the issue is excel for mac or mac since I use 365 for both machines, but I assume is a 365 excel for mac issues.  the spreadsheet is indeed an .xls btw.  I am unable to consolidate using a mac as well so this is not only limited to upload.   I don't  think its that big an issue for most folks to find a PC, and although I haven't tried using a virtual windows machine that may work too.  I would make this a low priority and just make folks aware is pc only.</p>
