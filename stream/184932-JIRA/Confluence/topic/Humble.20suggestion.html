<p>This is not about the tool itself, but about usability of the space. </p>
<p>I keep hearing people talk about CBCP, and we're meeting with them next week. So I decided to find out who they are.  I went and searched Confluence's "space" directory, and no luck. </p>
<p>My suggestion is that in the space directory, each space's description should include its familiar abbreviation.  (The space search does find matches in Description text.)</p>
<p>(I found my answer in this case by searching the whole site, which found "CBCP" in various minutes docs.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span>  I think that's a fantastic suggestion. Anything that helps the Confluence indexing for searches is a good thing. It's on my agenda for next week! Thank you</p>
