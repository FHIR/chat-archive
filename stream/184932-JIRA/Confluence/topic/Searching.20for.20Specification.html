<p>Just checked out the new Jira Tracker an tried to search for all tracker items for a Work Group, which works fine. But when i try to get all trackers for a Specification, it doesn't work.<br>
The search term Specification is recognized, but there is no auto-complete on the value, and nothing is found.<br>
Example: <code>Specification = "Genomics Reporting (FHIR)" </code>doesn't return any issues.</p>

<p>There are a few fields in Jira that are 'look-up' fields.  To get search on those to work, you need to fill in the pre-requisites.  To get workgroup or specification to function, you have to select the project (FHIR) and the issue types (all 4).  To filter by artifacts or pages, you need project, issue type <em>and</em> specification selected.  (I believe this is covered in the documentation.  If you can't find it, holler and I'll update.)</p>
<p>For example, this query gives me 320 hits:<br>
<code>project = FHIR AND issuetype in ("Change Request", Comment, Question, "Technical Correction") AND Specification = "Genomics Reporting (FHIR) [FHIR-genomics-reporting]"</code></p>

<p>thanks!<br>
I played a little bit around with the arguments, the minimal search to provide to search for all CG IG Specification Trackers is <code>Specification ="Genomics Reporting (FHIR) [FHIR-genomics-reporting]"</code></p>

<p>In order to be able to select that value from the drop-down, you'd need to have constrained the others.</p>
