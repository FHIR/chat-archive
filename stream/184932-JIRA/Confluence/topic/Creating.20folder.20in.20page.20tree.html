<p>I've seen some WGs whose Confluence page has their concalls grouped into folders for each year.  I want to do that with ours - or at LEAST put them in "newest at top" order.  I imagine I can do Reorder one by one, but isn't that what computers are for?  Yet I can't find a way to. So:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it possible to sort them that way? Or does Confluence insist that everything shall be in ASCII sort?</li>
<li>Is it possible to create folder in the page tree?  This <a href="https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-questions/Create-Folder-in-a-space/qaq-p/47574">Atlassian community page</a> says no.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can organize pages in a hierarchy.  Just create a page for the year and nest your meeting minutes under the appropriate year.  There's a special control you can put on the 'year' page that will give you an ordered list.  You can see it here: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIRI/FHIR+SDC+meeting+minutes+2021">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIRI/FHIR+SDC+meeting+minutes+2021</a></p>

<p>To see the page hierarchy, click on the ... and say "View in Hierarchy"</p>

<p>I will try this ... I'm so puzzled that this is un-googleable!  Thanks</p>

<p>It worked - thank you so much!  </p>
<p>It's so counter-intuitive ... in the UI it <em>looks</em> like it's a folder.  There are many googleable pages where people are complaining about the lack of folder capability, and none of them (IIRC) have responses explaining this.  You are a Useful Guy.</p>

<p>I see it in <em>use</em> there (apparently) but I don't see the control itself (not surprisingly).  Are you talking about the <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/page-tree-macro-163414255.html">Page Tree Macro</a>, which I found by googling "confluence control to sort pages"?</p>
<p>I am wary of injecting a macro into a page. Is it less dangerous than I think, less likely to screw things up irretrievably than macros I've known in my youth?</p>

<p>I just found a different "organize by year" page, clicked edit, copied the control that was there, and pasted it into my own similar page.  Not actually sure how to look up the control from scratch</p>

<p>The child page macro lets you specify alpha order - we use yyyy mm dd at the start of each page title and it then all comes out in order.</p>
