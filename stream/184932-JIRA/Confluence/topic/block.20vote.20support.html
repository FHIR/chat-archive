<p>I have a large block that got approved today. I figured I could use a Jira "Bulk Change" to apply the vote. But this seems to require that the Resolution must also be changed to the same value. In my block I have some Persuasive, some Persuasive with Mod, and some Not Persuasive with Mod.  I can do a 3 Bulk Changes for each proposed resolution, but this seems odd. Is there no support for bulk change where the resolution status has already been specified?</p>

<p>+1, this would be a good feature. As it is I have to do them as blocks per resolution status.</p>
