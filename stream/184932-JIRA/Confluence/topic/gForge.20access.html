<p>I had tried to give everyone read-only access to gForge, but I can't find a way to do that that doesn't also allow people to create new gForge issues.  To avoid that problem, I've revoked access for everyone except <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191759">@Melva Peters</span> and myself.  If you really need to know what something looked like in gForge before the migration, talk to one of us.</p>
