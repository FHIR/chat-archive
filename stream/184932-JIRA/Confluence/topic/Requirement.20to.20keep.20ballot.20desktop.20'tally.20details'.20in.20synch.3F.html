<p>For ballots that are officially running out of Ballot Desktop, but has a matching BALDEF JIRA (in my case, <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/BALDEF-1977">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/BALDEF-1977</a>), is there any requirement to keep the full tally in sync? I have (finally) imported all comments from spreadsheets, but that then leaves our BALDEF JIRA out of sync with the overall tally in Ballot Desktop. I am sort of assuming that is OK, but thought perhaps I should confirm.</p>

<p>The BALDEF summary will only be accurate for ballots that were fully conducted in Jira.  For ballots conducted with votes submitted in the ballot desktop, Jira won't have any knowledge of votes that weren't accompanied by comments.</p>
