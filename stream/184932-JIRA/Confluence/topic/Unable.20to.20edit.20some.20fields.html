<p>Someone mentioned that they could no longer changes groups and other fields for triaged items.  You can :)  Use the "propose a disposition" workflow (or any of the other workflows) and it will bring up a dialogue box.  You'll automatically be in the "resolution" tab.  However, there are two other tabs - one for categorization and one for the original issue description.  You can switch between the tabs without losing your edits.  (Just don't hit escape - if you do that you lose all of your edits :( )  So if you want to see the full text of the original comment without losing (or saving) your edits, just switch tabs.</p>
<p>Note that you can actually make changes to the original submission this way.  It's fine to correct spelling to make things easier to find, but don't make other changes.  Everything that anyone does change is logged.</p>
