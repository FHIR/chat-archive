<p>One of the options available with Specification Feedback issues (whether FHIR, CDA, V2, or Other) is to 'Move' the issue.  Most commonly, Move is used to convert an issue from Technical Correction to Change Request or Question or something like that.  In rare cases (when the issue isn't associated with a ballot comment), it may be appropriate to move the issue from one Spec Feedback project to another.  E.g. If a comment comes in against CDA but is submitted against the FHIR spec because the user didn't understand where to post.</p>
<p>However, spec feedback issues should NEVER be moved to other projects (e.g. PSS, UTG, etc.).  If the result of a FHIR tracker item is the need to create a UTG request or new project or some other action, then create a brand new issue and link the issues.  Moving issues will likely break the workflow processes associated with the new project and will also mean that the issue will no longer show up in queries of the Spec Feedback project.  (And if the issue was associated with ballots, it'll no longer show up in ballot counts, etc.)</p>
