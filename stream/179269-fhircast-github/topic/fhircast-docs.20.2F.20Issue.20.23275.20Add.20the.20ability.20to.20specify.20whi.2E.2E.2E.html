<blockquote>
<p>For objects such as studies which may have several different items opened at the same time, and/or the same item be opened more than once, the ability to specify the location or view into which the object is being opened can be required.  This may be a tab number, a window, a separate area on a screen or any other way of identifying a view.<br>
To resolve this, the suggestion is to specify a hub.viewId to identify the view into which this object is being opened.  The format of the viewId shall be either a simple integer starting at 0.<br>
A single object shall not be opened more than once simultaneously without specifying a different viewId.<br>
Any operation not specifying the hub.viewId shall have an implicit viewId of 0.</p>
</blockquote>
