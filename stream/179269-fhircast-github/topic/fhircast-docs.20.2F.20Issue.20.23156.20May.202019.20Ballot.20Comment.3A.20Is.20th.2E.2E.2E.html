<p>In conversation with @NiklasSvenzen , @wmaethner, @RicardoQuintano, we decided to make a more structural change to enable community-submitted events and to allow events to mature independently of the base spec. </p>
<p>Proposed resolution: Persuasive with Mod</p>
<p>We will remove the switch events, but also move the Event Catalog out of the base FHIRcast specification. We will also define a documentation template and process to mature a given hook or set of hooks. (For inspiration, we'll look at the <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Maturity_Model" target="_blank" title="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Maturity_Model">FHIR Maturity Model</a> and <a href="https://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/#hook-maturity-model" target="_blank" title="https://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/#hook-maturity-model">CDS Hooks Maturity Model</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>## Montreal May 2019 Working Group Vote</p>
<p>@IoanaSingureanu moved the following disposition, seconded by @NiklasSvenzen </p>
<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Persuasive with Mod<br>
<strong>Disposition Comment:</strong> We will remove the switch events, but also move the Event Catalog out of the base FHIRcast specification. We will also define a documentation template and process and syntax to define and mature a given event or set of events considering how FHIR resources should be naturally included within event syntax. </p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Is the switch events needed?</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Issue/comment imported from <a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/issues/71" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/issues/71">https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/issues/71</a></p>
<p>"From an EMR/UI perspective, open, switch and close patient are understandable. From an application subscribed to FHIRCast events the difference between open and switch is small.</p>
<p>On open, the new patient/study will be the main one.<br>
On switch, the existing patient/study will be the main one.<br>
On close, the patient/study is no longer relevant.</p>
<p>Switch has the same connotation as open without a close of the current patient, forcing the application to listen to switch as well as open. The action it would take would be the same.<br>
From that point of view I wonder what the additional value of switch is and suggest to remove patient-switch and study-switch."</p>
