<p>Hey @bvdh, </p>
<p>I think that limiting our scope to workflow events is what gives FHIRcast meaning. I'd love to hear your ideas on how this should be different. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In previous Connecthaton discussions we also entertained scenario's where the same channel would be used for:<br>
- other context changes (e.g. creation, update, deletion of resources)<br>
- passing speech-2-text information (the text that was recorded).</p>
<p>So far as I understand the different resolutions, these events are not in scope of FHIRCast 1.0, but they will be in scope for future versions. As such "workflow-events" seams to be a little bit narrow. <br>
Workflow events seams to suggest to reflect to steps taken in a clinical workflow. I suggest to rephrase it to workflow _related_ events.</p>
