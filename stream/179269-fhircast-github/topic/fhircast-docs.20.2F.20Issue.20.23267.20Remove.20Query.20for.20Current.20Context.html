<p>Hey @isaacvetter </p>
<p>One thing similar to your comment to PR #266. We only seem to store the png of the diagrams and have a link as well, but that will make it difficult to update. We will need to find and update the editable version then export it as a png and recommit that as well.  What is your plan for those? We are both using drawio so whatever you end deciding to do here is probably what I will do for mine.</p>

<p>Hey @wmaethner , excellent point. :)</p>
<p>I'd forgotten that I was using <a href="http://draw.io" target="_blank" title="http://draw.io">draw.io</a> and not websequencediagrams for these. For the diagrams on the <a href="https://fhircast.org/security-considerations/" target="_blank" title="https://fhircast.org/security-considerations/">Security Considerations page</a>, I'm including a link to the publically-accessible image and raw diagram via google drive to <a href="http://draw.io" target="_blank" title="http://draw.io">draw.io</a>. For example, the fhircast page includes this text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The below <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pdG6Kw4pAG53J9d7_rK98DSvm_GMiCC/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pdG6Kw4pAG53J9d7_rK98DSvm_GMiCC/view?usp=sharing">flow diagram</a> illustrates each of the interactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't perfect, but it would enable a new editor to copy the existing diagram instead of re-creating it. </p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
