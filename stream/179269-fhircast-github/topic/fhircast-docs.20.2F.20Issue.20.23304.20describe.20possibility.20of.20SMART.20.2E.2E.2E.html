<blockquote>
<p>During II WG conversation, we discussed the possible race condition between a SMART app launch and a subscription being completed, such that the SMART launch context parameters, before completing a subscription, could become stale.</p>
<p>We should add language to the Synchronization Considerations as well as the Subscribing and Unsubscribing section of the spec describing this potential race condition. </p>

<p>We agree, but we still should resolve the issue. We think that one option to solve this problem is to let the hub, after finishing the subscription process, to send the last event to the app. What do you think?</p>
