2) &gt; Each subsequent request to a hub to subscribe or unsubscribe MUST override the previous subscription state for a specific topic, and callback URL combination once the action is verified.</p>
<p>Tony, this sentence is intended to communicate that the topic+callback url together identify a specific subscription for a subscriber. If the same subscriber re-requests a subscription for the same url and provides the same callback url, but with different hub.events and lease_seeconds: the HUB SHALL overwrite the previously established subscription. </p>
<p>How about:<br>
<strong>Proposed wording:</strong> Each subsequent and verified request to a hub to subscribe or unsubscribe MUST override the previous subscription state for a specific topic / callback URL combination.</p>
