<p><strong>Summary:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Initially I thought the spec didn't indicate what to do when the access token expires.  However, I found information about renewal in a description field in a table.  This should be in a dedicated section in the specification rather than buried in a table.  Additionally, it would be helpful to know the corner cases that need to be handled by the client, e.g., after the access token expires, are messages to be queued up until the client renews the access token and if so, how long will messages be queued and will the be out of context by the time the client receives them?  What is the life-cycle of a subscription and will the subscriptions be long-lived?  (There are several other implications and/or corner cases that could be explored here.)</p>
<p><strong>Existing wording:</strong>  In all cases the app authenticates to the Hub with an OAuth 2.0 bearer token</p>

<p>## May 2019 Ballot Comment: </p>

<strong>Type:</strong> NEG <span aria-label="exclamation" class="emoji emoji-2757" role="img" title="exclamation">:exclamation:</span> <br>
<strong>In Person requested:</strong> Yes :bust_in_silhouette: </p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Initially I thought the spec didn't indicate what to do when the access token expires.  However, I found information about renewal in a description field in a table.  This should be in a dedicated section in the specification rather than buried in a table.  Additionally, it would be helpful to know the corner cases that need to be handled by the client, e.g., after the access token expires, are messages to be queued up until the client renews the access token and if so, how long will messages be queued and will the be out of context by the time the client receives them?  What is the life-cycle of a subscription and will the subscriptions be long-lived?  (There are several other implications and/or corner cases that could be explored here.)</p>
<p><strong>Existing wording:</strong>  In all cases the app authenticates to the Hub with an OAuth 2.0 bearer token</p>
