<strong>In Person requested:</strong> Yes :bust_in_silhouette: </p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> There is an inconsistency between the unguessable nature of the hub.topic as provided via the SMART-on-FHIR/OAuth 2.0 exchange and the fact the hub.topic is a URL.  WIth hub.topic being a URL, it is inherently no longer unguessable, as any network traffic inspector can see the URL that is being requested.  Would suggest reworking the hub.topic (and any other sensitive values) to be placed either in the payload or in the headers of the request/response.</p>
<p><strong>Existing wording:</strong> Specifically, the hub.topic url must be unique, unguessable, and specific to the session.</p>

<strong>In Person requested:</strong> Yes :bust_in_silhouette: </p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> There is an inconsistency between the unguessable nature of the hub.topic as provided via the SMART-on-FHIR/OAuth 2.0 exchange and the fact the hub.topic is a URL.  WIth hub.topic being a URL, it is inherently no longer unguessable, as any network traffic inspector can see the URL that is being requested.  Would suggest reworking the hub.topic (and any other sensitive values) to be placed either in the payload or in the headers of the request/response.</p>
<p><strong>Existing wording:</strong> Specifically, the hub.topic url must be unique, unguessable, and specific to the session.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is "Not Related" really the correct disposition, above? It seems unlikely. </p>
<p>As Phil emphasizes, the <code>hub.topic</code> should be unique, unguessable, and session-specific. We were previously re-using the <code>hub.topic</code> both as an session identifier, and also as the url to which the "query for current context" should be requested. We removed the query for current context during the ballot. </p>
<p>Note also, that the "Request for context changes" was also previously being made at the <code>hub.topic</code>. I changed this to the base <code>hub.url</code> to satisfy this issue. The "request for context changes" message does include the <code>hub.topic</code> in the body. I'm not certain that this is the correct decision.</p>
<p>I _think_ that a guid would be a good choice for this field by implementers. </p>
