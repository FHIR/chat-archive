<blockquote>
<p>The subject of this post pretty much asks the question. According the specification, the "context" of the event is an "array of named FHIR objects". Given each resource has a resourceType value, isn't the key redundant? @isaacvetter , @wmaethner  You guys have been on this for much longer than I have. Am I missing something? </p>
