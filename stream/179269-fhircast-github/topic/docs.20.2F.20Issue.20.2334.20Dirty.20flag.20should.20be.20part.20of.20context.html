<blockquote>
<p>it seems to me that an everyday-scenario for such a context is to have a "dirty flag".<br>
Suppose a smart-on-fhir app runs within an EMR. User changes data in the app - which should be setting a "dirty flag". The EMR usually displays such a status with a marker to the user.<br>
This would also be important because before the EMR decides to switch the context - the app get an event asking to save or discard data ...</p>

<p>Hi @jmehlbrech!</p>
<p>Apologies for the ridiculously late response. </p>
<p>This sounds like a potentially powerful integration feature, but comes at the risk of violating a separation of concerns. </p>
<p>Why wouldn't the app simply save the modified data - either to it's own data store, or by writing to the EHR in lieu of communicating this as part of the context synchronization?</p>

<p>Hi Isaac,<br>
thanks for coming back to this - I fully understand that this point might come to late for a first release.</p>
<p>EMR and app are connected through the context, e.g. with an encounter.</p>
<p>The EMR doesn't know if data in the app was changed - and nowadays users expect to be asked (in a common ui) if they want to save or discard data.</p>
<p>So suppose the user attempts to switch to a different encounter.  Wouldn't he/she expect to be asked for save/discard? Since only the EMR knows about all unsaved data - it makes sense to ask for that in a central place, i.e. the EMR. Also many EMRs indicate with ui specific unsaved data.</p>
<p>This feature targets integrating apps seamlessly..</p>
<p>Hope this helps ..</p>
