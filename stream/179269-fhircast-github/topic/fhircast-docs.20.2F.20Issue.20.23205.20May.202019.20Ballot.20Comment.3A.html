<p><strong>Summary:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> What is a FHIR object?  If it is exactly like CDS Hook;s context, then that is what it is, if it is only similar, it needs to be enumerated.  Also the Description of context in this section says the the hub SHALL only return FHIR resources.  Nothing about bits and pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Existing wording:</strong> The notification's hub.event and context fields inform the subscriber of the current state of the user's session. The hub.event is a user workflow event, from the Event Catalog. The context is an array of named FHIR objects (similar to CDS Hooks's context field) that describe the current content of the user's session. Each event in the Event Catalog defines what context is expected in the notification. Hubs MAY use the FHIR _elements parameter to limit the size of the data being passed while also including additional, local identifiers that are likely already in use in production implementations. Subscribers MUST accept a full FHIR resource or the _elements-limited resource as defined in the Event Catalog.<br>

<strong>Proposed wording:</strong> The notification's hub.event and context fields inform the subscriber of the current state of the user's session. The hub.event is a user workflow event, from the Event Catalog. The context is an array of named FHIR objects (similar to CDS Hooks's context field) that describe the current content of the user's session. Each event in the Event Catalog defines what context is expected in the notification. Hubs MAY use the FHIR _elements parameter to limit the size of the data being passed while also including additional, local identifiers that are likely already in use in production implementations. Subscribers SHALL accept a full FHIR resource or the _elements-limited resource as defined in the Event Catalog.</p>

<h2>May 2019 Ballot Comment:</h2>

<strong>Chapter/section:</strong>  Event Notification Request Details<br>

<strong>Type:</strong> NEG <span aria-label="exclamation" class="emoji emoji-2757" role="img" title="exclamation">:exclamation:</span> Clarification<br>
<strong>In Person requested:</strong> Yes :bust_in_silhouette: </p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> What is a FHIR object?  If it is exactly like CDS Hook;s context, then that is what it is, if it is only similar, it needs to be enumerated.  Also the Description of context in this section says the the hub SHALL only return FHIR resources.  Nothing about bits and pieces.</p>
