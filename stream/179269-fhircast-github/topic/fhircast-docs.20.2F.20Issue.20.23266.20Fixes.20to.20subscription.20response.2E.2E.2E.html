<blockquote>
<p>@wmaethner - love the diagrams! Two questions/suggestions:</p>
<p>1) You're committing just the images of the diagrams, not the source materials, such that editing them would require re-creating them. Can you also commit the source (for example, if you were using <a href="http://websequencediagrams.com" target="_blank" title="http://websequencediagrams.com">websequencediagrams.com</a>, the textual representation of the diagram in a text file). </p>
<p>2) Your denial diagram strongly implies that a denial will only and ever immediately follow a subscription request. Our spec, as well as the WebSub spec are clear that a denial may occur at any time, even after having successfully sent notifications. What do you think about updating the diagram's text callout, to something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>App subscribes to hub. Hub denies subscription. <strong>This denial may occur at any time, even after a successful intent verification or event notifications.</strong></p>

<p>Hey @isaacvetter,</p>
<p>I think I shared the diagrams and referenced them the same way you did in the other PR. Let me know if I missed anything.</p>
