<p>GinoCanessa opened <a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/pull/348">PR #348</a> from <code>master</code> to <code>master</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just a pass of editorial-type changes (Isaac did an open request on a call earlier this week).  I've listed a few specific questions below, but request that someone else reviews EACH change; I tried to keep to strictly corrections, but assume I made some style changes as well.  Most of the changes fall into only a few categories: conformance language capitalization, acronym consistency capitalization (e.g., JSON), and cleaning up things from other edits (e.g., something was added to a sentence and mismatched plurality).</p>
<p>Note: I won't be offended by any changes/corrections/disregarding of any suggestions in this PR.</p>
<p>Some specific questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>FHIRcast Authorization &amp; SMART scopes, paragraph 1: I've changed "should" to "SHOULD" to call out conformance language, but am wondering if the intent was SHALL.</li>
<li>Subscription Response, paragraph 2: "is not meant to be shown to the end user".  I believe there should be conformance language here, but I'm not comfortable recommending what that is (e.g., SHOULD NOT / SHALL NOT).</li>
<li>General: dictionaries don't find "unsubscription"; I believe the intent where it was used is clear, but I did change it in this PR (again, feel free to disregard those edits).</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheers!</p>
