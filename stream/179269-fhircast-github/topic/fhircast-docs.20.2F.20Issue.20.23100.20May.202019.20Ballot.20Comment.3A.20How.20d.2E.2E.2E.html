<p><strong>Summary:</strong> How does the hub inform its subscribers that the subscription is ending?</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> The unsubscribing section explains what happens when the subscribing app no longer wants to receive notifications, but doesn't explain what happens when the hub no longer wants to send out notifications (for example when the hub client closes or logs out and wants to end its subscriptions). Does this fall under the denial case? If so that should be clarified.</p>

<p>During conversation at the Montreal, May 2019 working group meeting, @wvdr, @wmaethner, @NiklasSvenzen and myself talked through this issue and would like to propose:</p>
<p>We talked through 4 scenarios: <br>
4) hub business logic - Hub denies existing subscription. Already covered, text could be more prominent. <br>
3) unexpected end of session - in the case where the Hub crashes, no notification is possible. <br>
1) lease_seconds expires - the subscribing client is responsible for tracking it the lease of it's subscription.<br>
2) user_logout - this is an event and otherwise falls into the hub business logic category.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Resolution:</strong> Persuasive</p>
<p>Do note that the spec already says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The subscription MAY be denied by the Hub at any point (even if it was previously accepted). The Subscriber SHOULD then consider that the subscription is not possible anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Will update the spec to clarify that a hub SHALL send a <code>mode=denied</code> to the subscriber when a subscription ends, including an expired  . </p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> How does the hub inform its subscribers that the subscription is ending?</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> The unsubscribing section explains what happens when the subscribing app no longer wants to receive notifications, but doesn't explain what happens when the hub no longer wants to send out notifications (for example when the hub client closes or logs out and wants to end its subscriptions). Does this fall under the denial case? If so that should be clarified.</p>
