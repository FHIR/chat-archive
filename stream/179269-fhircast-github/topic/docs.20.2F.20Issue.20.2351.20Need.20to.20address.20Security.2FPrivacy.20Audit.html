<blockquote>
<p>Hey @JohnMoehrke , </p>
<p>I see the use of FHIRcast for audit logging as a potential, secondary use-case for the specification. </p>
<p>I don't think that it makes sense to explicitly call out this secondary usecase until/unless it has seen some experimentation, prototyping and validation. </p>
<p>Additionally, qudit logging notably differs from the primary usecase of context synchronization in the importance of old, failed event notifications. I don't know if this difference will prove critical or not. <br>
 (Related: PR #53).</p>
<p>Since we've already published the related Security Considerations guidance in PR #60, I'm going to close this issue until there are more implementors looking to use FHIRcast for audit logging. </p>
<p>Respond/re-open if you disagree.</p>
<p>Isaac</p>
