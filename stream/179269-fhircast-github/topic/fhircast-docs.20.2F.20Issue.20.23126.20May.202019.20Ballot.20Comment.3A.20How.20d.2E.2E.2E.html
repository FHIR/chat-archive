<p>Hey @bvdh,</p>
<p>I'm not sure what to do here. With the resolution to #127, we have an OAuth2 scope discovery protocol via SMART's <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/conformance/index.html#using-well-known" target="_blank" title="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/conformance/index.html#using-well-known">.well-known/smart-configuration</a>. </p>
<p>But:<br>
1) scopes !== events. <br>
2) OAuth2 is not a requirement. </p>
<p>Can we "consider for future use"? Alternatively, would you be willing to draft up a more detailed proposal/documentation of how this GET on the cast-url should work? </p>
<p>Isaac</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So to add to the proposed suggestion:</p>
<p>we could have our library of events, linked to scopes in OAuth (we would need to create hierarchy in the events though).</p>
<p>E.g. scope: <code>patient</code><br>
events: <br>
<code>patient.open</code><br>
<code>patient.close</code><br>
<code>patient.*</code></p>
<p>Scope <code>study</code>:<br>
events: <br>
<code>study.open</code><br>
<code>study.close</code><br>
<code>study.*</code></p>
<p>So when having the OAuth 'study' scope, you could subscribe to any <code>study.*</code> events (also events not yet in the library, such as <code>study.foo</code>).</p>
<p>If you however do not have the study scope, you would not be able to register to this event. </p>
<p>events that are not in the library could be either always allowed - without specific scope, or have to fall under a certain umbrella, e.g.</p>
<p><code>other.*</code><br>
or even<br>
<code>public.*</code> - indicating that no authenticating is needed for this 'subgroup' of events.</p>
