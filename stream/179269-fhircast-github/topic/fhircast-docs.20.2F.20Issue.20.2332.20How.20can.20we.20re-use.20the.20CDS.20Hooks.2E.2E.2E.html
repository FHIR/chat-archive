<blockquote>
<p>We could also extend FHIRcast with CDS hooks events, which would allow the FHIRcast channel to be used to update the applications of CDS Hooks events.<br>
These events would be triggered from updates to the EMR context in the way that is described in the CDS Hooks standard.</p>
<p>Event-name: cdshooks-event<br>
Context:<br>
    hook: the cds-hook hook<br>
    context: the context as defined in the CDS-Hooks hook<br>
OAuth<br>
    fhircast/cdshooks/&lt;hook&gt;/receive - receive cdshooks hook events for this hook<br>
    fhircast/cdshooks/&lt;hook&gt;/send - send cdshooks hook events for this hook</p>
