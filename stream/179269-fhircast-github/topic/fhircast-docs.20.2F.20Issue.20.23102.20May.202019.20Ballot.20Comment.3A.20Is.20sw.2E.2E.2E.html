<p>## May 2019 Ballot Comment: Is switch needed?</p>
<p>Submitted by @MichaelTClifton on behalf of @wmaethner (<a href="mailto:wmaethne@epic.com" title="mailto:wmaethne@epic.com">wmaethne@epic.com</a> )<br>
<strong>Chapter/section:</strong>  Event Catalog<br>
<strong>Url:</strong> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> A-Q Enhancement</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Is switch needed?</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Do we need the patient and imaging switch events? Starting with the simple model of open/close events is really appealing, but also limits the complexity of a context synchronization integration. How many systems today support a switch concept? How many systems today, support having multiple patients or studies open at a time?</p>
