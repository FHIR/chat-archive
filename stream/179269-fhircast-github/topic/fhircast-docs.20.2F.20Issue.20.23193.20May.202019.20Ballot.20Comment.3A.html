<p>Hey Tony, </p>
<p>I'm adding this into the proposed block vote as well, because I see it as a question and a ANSI modal verb update. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>what are the criteria for denial?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The criteria for why a Hub denies a subscription is not explained by the spec. This is business logic of the Hub &amp; driving application. Any number of security-related reasons could cause a Hub to deny a subscription. The Hub could determine that the <code>hub.topic</code> isn't valid or even that the subscriber is required <code>hub.events</code> not supported by the Hub or that the subscriber isn't authorized to join the particular user's session or .... </p>
<p>Does that help?</p>

<p>Hey Tony, </p>
<p>I'm adding this into the proposed block vote as well, because I see it as a question and a ANSI modal verb update. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>what are the criteria for denial?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The criteria for why a Hub denies a subscription is not explained by the spec. This is business logic of the Hub &amp; driving application. Any number of security-related reasons could cause a Hub to deny a subscription. The Hub could determine that the <code>hub.topic</code> isn't valid or even that the subscriber's required <code>hub.events</code> are not supported by the Hub or that the subscriber isn't authorized to join the particular user's session or .... </p>
<p>Does that help?</p>
