<p>## May 2019 Ballot Comment: Add dependence on SMART Launch and launch contexts in addition to session-related events.</p>
<p>Submitted by Greg Staudenmaier   on behalf of @IoanaSingureanu (<a href="mailto:ioana.singureanu@bookzurman.com" title="mailto:ioana.singureanu@bookzurman.com">ioana.singureanu@bookzurman.com</a> )<br>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Add dependence on SMART Launch and launch contexts in addition to session-related events.</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> CCOW is widely implemented across VA and it's important to maintain the same functiionality as the industry migrates to CCOW relies on "common" contexts that may be changed by any of the  CCOW-enable, desktop-integrated applications.   It's important to maintain the same functionity, the hub.topics should support events relevant to session and context changes.</p>
<p><strong>Existing wording:</strong> As part of a SMART launch, the app requests the fhircast OAuth 2.0 scope and receives the location of the Hub and a unique hub.topic url, which serves as the identifier of the user's session.<br>
<strong>Proposed wording:</strong> Add "To support all the functionality currently avaialble in CCOW implementatoin , this specification relies on the "SMART-on-FHIR Launch" to provide  authentication, application registration, and launch contexts (e.g. Patient/123, Encounter/456). Therefore SMART-on-FHIR Launch is a pre-requisite specification. Synchornizing application may use event notifications to indicate whether a SMART launch context was changed during a session.  For example if the EHR is the "driving application" and an imaging application is "syncrhonizing", the user may change the encounter to view another diagnostic imaging study. That notification would be available to the EHR, if it subscrubed to that event and the user could then change context to the EHR to view the associated report. "</p>

<p>Hi @IoanaSingureanu,</p>
<p><a href="https://fhircast.hl7.org/#how-it-works" target="_blank" title="https://fhircast.hl7.org/#how-it-works">This page</a> is outside of the normative-track content and is intended to be supplemental material that is not part of the specification and is not being balloted.</p>
<p>Overall, FHIRcast does not support _all_ the functionality of CCOW. We've tried to make FHIRcast simpler, http-based and focused on the implementer. </p>
<p>During conversation at the Montreal, May 2019 working group meeting, @wdvr, @wmaethner, @NiklasSvenzen and myself talked through this issue and will adopt the following wording:</p>
<p><strong>Proposed wording:</strong>  As part of a SMART launch, the app requests the <code>fhircast</code> OAuth 2.0 scope and receives the location of the Hub and a unique <code>hub.topic</code> url, which serves as the identifier of the user's session. The SMART app launch receives the current context as SMART launch parameters and receives additional context event notifications when the SMART launch context changes during a session. </p>
<p>Further, we will create an additional, non-normative page on the FHIRcast website statin,g at least, some of the differences between FHIRcast and CCOW to better explain that FHIRcast is a lightweight alternative to CCOW. A full-featured FHIRcast hub will not support the same features as a CCOW context manager.  </p>

<p>## May 2019 Ballot Comment: Add dependence on SMART Launch and launch contexts in addition to session-related events.</p>
<p>Submitted by Greg Staudenmaier   on behalf of @IoanaSingureanu (<a href="mailto:ioana.singureanu@bookzurman.com" title="mailto:ioana.singureanu@bookzurman.com">ioana.singureanu@bookzurman.com</a> )<br>
<strong>Chapter/section:</strong>  <br>
<strong>Url:</strong> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> A-S <br>
<strong>In Person requested:</strong> Yes :bust_in_silhouette: </p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Add dependence on SMART Launch and launch contexts in addition to session-related events.</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> CCOW is widely implemented across VA and it's important to maintain the same functiionality as the industry migrates to CCOW relies on "common" contexts that may be changed by any of the  CCOW-enable, desktop-integrated applications.   It's important to maintain the same functionity, the hub.topics should support events relevant to session and context changes.</p>
<p><strong>Existing wording:</strong> As part of a SMART launch, the app requests the fhircast OAuth 2.0 scope and receives the location of the Hub and a unique hub.topic url, which serves as the identifier of the user's session.<br>
<strong>Proposed wording:</strong> Add "To support all the functionality currently avaialble in CCOW implementatoin , this specification relies on the "SMART-on-FHIR Launch" to provide  authentication, application registration, and launch contexts (e.g. Patient/123, Encounter/456). Therefore SMART-on-FHIR Launch is a pre-requisite specification. Synchornizing application may use event notifications to indicate whether a SMART launch context was changed during a session.  For example if the EHR is the "driving application" and an imaging application is "syncrhonizing", the user may change the encounter to view another diagnostic imaging study. That notification would be available to the EHR, if it subscrubed to that event and the user could then change context to the EHR to view the associated report. "</p>
