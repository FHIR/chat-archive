<blockquote>
<p>In our opinion, it should be ensured and clarified in the specs that a context update is a ‘replace’ action (PUT in rest terms). Failure to do so could lead to invalid contexts, with mixed properties across patients/studies.</p>
<p>The terminology could reflect this, by talking about ‘SETting’ the (full) context as part of the event.</p>
<p>It would be the responsibility of the subscriber to update the context in the event with all necessary and known fields, also the ones that didn't change.</p>
<p>The GET of the context would become a GET of the latest event. The event contains the last known context.</p>
