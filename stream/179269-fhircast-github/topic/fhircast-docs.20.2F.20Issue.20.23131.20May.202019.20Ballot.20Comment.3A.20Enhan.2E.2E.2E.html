<p>Ricardo Quintano Neira moved the following disposition, seconded by Alex Goel</p>
<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Persuasive<br>
<strong>Disposition Comment:</strong> Change this wording:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within FHIRcast, the client that creates a subscription and the server that hosts the callback url are the same entity. If these roles are split, the Hub assumes that the same authorization and access rights apply to both systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The client that creates the subscription may not be the same system as the server hosting the callback url. (For example, some type of federated authorization model could possibly exist between these two systems). However, in FHIRcast, the hub assumes that the same authorization and access rights apply to both the subscribing client and the callback url.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, we'll update the Security Considerations to mention this concern. </p>
