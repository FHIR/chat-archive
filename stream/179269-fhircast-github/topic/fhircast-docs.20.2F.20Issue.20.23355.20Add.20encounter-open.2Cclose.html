<blockquote>
<p>I'm worried about how the events line up.  Specifically, since <code>encounter-close</code> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>User closed patient's medical record encounter context. A previously open and in context patient chart &amp; encounter is no longer open nor in context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it becomes a lot of work to process moving between encounters on the same patient.</p>

<p>Thanks, @GinoCanessa ! I changed to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>User closed patient's medical record encounter context. A previously open and in context patient encounter is no longer open nor in context. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>to clarify that the patient's chart was necessary to close to satisfy an <code>encounter-close</code>. Is it a lot of work to move between encounters on the same patient? I'm not sure. Note that moving between encounters on the same patient isn't a typical clinical workflow, but could be typical in an back-office / audit / review / billing workflow. The work involved is generated an open and close event for each encounter navigated to...</p>
<p>What do you think?<br>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks @isaacvetter !</p>
<p>I think it was me incorrectly (or maybe just too aggressively) mapping the event - I was thinking of things like opening and closing notes from prior encounters.  If that were the case, reviewing an earlier encounter would close and re-open the patient.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to make that clearer.  E.g., yes the user is _looking_ at a different encounter, but that's not the one in context so don't generate this message.</p>
