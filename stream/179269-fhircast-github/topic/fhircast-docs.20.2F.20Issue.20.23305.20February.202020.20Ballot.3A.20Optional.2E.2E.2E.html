<blockquote>
<p>Should FHIRcast Hubs be able to support only a single channel type or is it mandatory that they support both webhook and websocket?</p>
<p>Assuming support for one or the other channel type being optional, should we explicitly mention in 'Subscription Response' section that one reason for denying a subscription request is that the Hub does not support the requested hub.channel.type?  For example, add the quoted and italicized text:</p>
<p>was received and will now be verified by the Hub. "_Since support of both Hub channel types is not required the Hub may reject the subscription request if the requested hub.channel.type is not supported._" If using websockets</p>
