<blockquote>
<p>I know we've discussed and prototyped this a couple of times (@isaacvetter, @NiklasSvenzen, @wmaethner) but did we ever talk about including a measurement event in the standard event catalog? I'm thinking of the scenario where someone is, for example, writing a report in an EMR and doing measurements in a PACS and would like the measurements to show up in the structured report.</p>
