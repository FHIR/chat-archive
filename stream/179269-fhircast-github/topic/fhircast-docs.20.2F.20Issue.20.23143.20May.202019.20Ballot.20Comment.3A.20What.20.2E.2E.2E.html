- The Hub should exactly maintain state for each subscribed client. For launch/simple stuff, this is trivial. For more complex scenarios, the client needs to receive the whole set of events. </p>
<p>Wouter - if current context is an imagingstudy related, does that clear previous events? Patient vs imagingstudy relationship? We should always send the full context for a sync event [and not create a need to infer context based upon previous events].</p>
<p>Jeremy - If the ImagingStudy.open event changes the patient, why have named events at all? <strong>Yes, we should be pushing the whole context</strong> (including the patient). FHIRcast should simply ensure that the patient in an external system in focus should be brought to the foreground in my system. Eventing makes Hub implementation more difficult. Being able to extend, AI-based measurements into reports is important. </p>

<p>@gkustas - a getLatestEvent function seems useful. Would be okay removing for further discussion. Would simply want to know what patient/study are open. We oughn't lump draft measurements into this one method. </p>
<p>Topics for further analysis:<br>
- What is the difference between _state_ and _context_?<br>
- How should FHIRcast enable draft measurement exchange? <br>
- ... ?</p>
