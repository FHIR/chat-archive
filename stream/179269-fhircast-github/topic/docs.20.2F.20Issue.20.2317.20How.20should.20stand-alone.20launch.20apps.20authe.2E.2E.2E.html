<p>Hey @jeremysrichardson ,</p>
<p>I think that this is closely related to #4 , see the resolution to that issue and the spec's <a href="http://fhircast.org/launch-scenarios/" target="_blank" title="http://fhircast.org/launch-scenarios/">Launch Scenario's</a> page. </p>
<p>I had initially tried to also fit Backend services into FHIRcast as a third launching mechanism, but got held up on <a href="https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/fhir-bulk-data-docs/issues/44" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/fhir-bulk-data-docs/issues/44">this conversation</a>. (tldr; backend services doesn't have a user, we necesssarily do).</p>
<p>I _think_ this resolves, this particular issue, will you re-open if you disagree?</p>
<p>Isaac</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I spoke with a few people to try to get my head around how authentication would work for stand-alone apps.  I spoke with Isaac, and he thought it might be more appropriate to use the back-end services model for SMART over OAuth2.</p>
