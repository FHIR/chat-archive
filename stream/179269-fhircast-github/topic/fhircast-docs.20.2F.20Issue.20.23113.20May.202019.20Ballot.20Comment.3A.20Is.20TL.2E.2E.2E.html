<p>During conversation at the Montreal, May 2019 working group meeting, @RicardoQuintano, @wmaethner, @NiklasSvenzen and myself talked through this issue and would like to:</p>
<p><strong>Propose a resolution:</strong> TLS (HTTPS) is always required to be compliant with the specification. SMART on FHIR is recommended, but not required and this will be clarified in #125 for SMART. </p>
