<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Query parameters are inherently insecure and present risk of information leakage of hub-specific metadata to any listeners.  A POST via HTTPS would be much more secure and would more properly obfuscate the information in the denial.  The Session Discovery section mentions that hub.topics are presented in the SMART on FHIR launch.  An alternative location to place these data, if GET is preferred, is the HTTP headers.</p>
<p><strong>Existing wording:</strong> If (and when) the subscription is denied, the Hub MUST inform the subscriber by sending an HTTP GET request to the subscriber's callback URL as given in the subscription request.<br>
<strong>Proposed wording:</strong> If (and when) the subscription is denied, the Hub MUST inform the subscriber by sending an HTTPS POST request to the subscriber's callback URL as given in the subscription request.</p>
