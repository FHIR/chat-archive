<blockquote>
<p>Added context to the current close events (patient and study). @NiklasSvenzen I know you mentioned also adding context to the logout events, that would be the user right? If we added that what would the resource be (we don't have anything like that in any of the other events), or since we have already done validation of this subscription based on the topic, does the topic already have enough user context to handle the logout events?</p>

<p>Good catch @lbergnehr. Found a few other instances with that same typo since I basically just copied the context from the other events, so I went ahead and fixed those as well. Re-committing and requesting review. </p>
