<p>Hey @bvdh, we're struggling with this. How to describe the exchange of the <code>hub.topic</code> when the type of launch mechanisms commonly used are not really appropriate to standardize?</p>
<p>Can you help?</p>

<p><strong>Proposed resolution:</strong> Persuasive<br>
<strong>Proposed resolution comment:</strong> We will clarify that SMART on FHIR support is a SHOULD, not a SHALL, but that guidance on the exchange of the hub.topic (and hub.url) is currently not defined in this specification. Further, we will consider a proposal for an OAuth-less launch description if it is made in time for this release and has implementer support and feedback.</p>
