<p><strong>Proposed resolution</strong>: Duplicate <br>
<strong>Proposed resolution comment</strong>: Duplicate of #143. Resolved by removing query for current context. While this is a trivial resolution, because I think that @bvdh intended for this comment to be a more substantive comment per his reference to #71, #71 is also being resolved as persuasive by #156.</p>
