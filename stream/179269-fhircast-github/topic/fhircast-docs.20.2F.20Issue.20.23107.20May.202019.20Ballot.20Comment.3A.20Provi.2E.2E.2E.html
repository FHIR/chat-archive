<p>## May 2019 Ballot Comment: Provide etensible syntax for "hub.topic" scopes similar to SMART scopes and consistent with Pub/Sub event processing best-practices. This grammar could be used ot create an extensible event catalog.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Provide etensible syntax for "hub.topic" scopes similar to SMART scopes and consistent with Pub/Sub event processing best-practices. This grammar could be used ot create an extensible event catalog.</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Since the "hub.topics" are meant to be events, it would be useful to create a hierarchy of events using a BNF grammar similar SMRT clinical context scopes. For instance: "session.*" hub.topic scope would correspond to all session-related events or alterantively an could subscribe to either "Session.close" or "session.change". Similarly the "hub.topic" could be centered on a a FHIR resource - similar to SMART scoes - "patient.selected" , "device.selected". The lesson of CCOW is that standardizeding  the "contexts" and creating an extensible grammar/sytax are both needed for adption. Pub/sub topics provide a similar hierarchical approach to "topic" definitons. </p>

<p>@NiklasSvenzen moved the following disposition, seconded by @gkustas</p>
<p>Disposition: : Persuasive with Mod<br>
Disposition Comment:: We will create a simple syntax for FHIRcast events modeled after SMART's scope syntax and based upon FHIR resources. Except for the "meta" sync-error event, we will move the Event Catalog out of the specification. sync-error will be renamed to syncerror. Per other comments, we will also define a process for the publishing of new events within the Event Catalog.</p>
<p>FHIRcast events are an extensible syntax based upon FHIR resources, following the SMART on FHIR scope syntax.</p>
<p>Expressed in EBNF notation, the FHIRcast syntax for workflow related events is:</p>
<p>hub.events ::= ( fhir-resource ) '-' ( 'open' | 'close' )<br>
image</p>
<p>The event notification or request for context change message SHALL be accompanied by the fhir-resource named in the hub.events. Further, the Event Catalog may define additional resources to be included within the event.</p>
