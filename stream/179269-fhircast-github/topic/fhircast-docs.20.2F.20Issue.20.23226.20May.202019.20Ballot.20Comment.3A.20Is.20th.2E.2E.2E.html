<p>During conversation at the Montreal, May 2019 working group meeting, @wdvr, @wmaethner, @NiklasSvenzen and myself talked through this issue and would like to propose:</p>
<p>Proposed resolution: Persusasive with mod<br>
Remove "driving application" and reword.</p>
<p><strong>Existing wording</strong>: The app MUST either be launched from the driving application following the SMART on FHIR EHR launch flow or the app may initiate the launch following the SMART on FHIR standalone launch. In either case, the app MUST request and be granted the fhircast OAuth2.0 scope.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed wording</strong>: Following a SMART on FHIR EHR launch or SMART standalone launch, the app SHALL request and if authorized, SHALL be granted the fhircast OAuth 2.0 scope.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Is there a need to distinguish subscrbing applications?</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Is there a need to distinguish between driving and syncrhonizing applications? Should all application  syncrhonize on all events/hub.topics they subscribed? WebSub doesn't make this distinction and neither did CCOW.</p>
