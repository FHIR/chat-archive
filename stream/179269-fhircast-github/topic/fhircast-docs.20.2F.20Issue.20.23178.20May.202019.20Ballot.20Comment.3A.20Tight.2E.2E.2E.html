<p>Tony,</p>
<p>The nuance here is that the OAuth2 RFCs and SMART as well, clearly places the responsibility and authority for determining the scopes that a client is authorized for, on the authorization server. </p>
<p>If FHIRcast stated that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>app SHALL request and SHALL be granted the fhircast OAuth2.0 scope</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We run the risk of contradicting OAuth and the authorization server's ability to actually determine if authorizing the FHIRcast client is appropriate. </p>
<p>How about adding the phrase "if authorized, ", in this paragraph -- </p>
<p><strong>Proposed wording:</strong> The app SHALL either be launched from the driving application following the SMART on FHIR EHR launch flow or initiate the launch following the SMART on FHIR standalone launch. In either case, the app SHALL request and if authorized, SHALL be granted the fhircast OAuth2.0 scope. Accompanying this scope grant, the authorization server SHALL supply the cast-hub and hub.topic SMART launch parameters alongside the access token. These parameters identify the Hub's base url, and a unique, opaque identifier of the current user's session, respectively. Per SMART, when scopes of openid and fhirUser are granted, the app SHALL additionally receive the current user's identity in an id_token.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Tighter restriction on Conformance Criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> See note on ANSI Modal Verbs: The phrase "the app may" negates the SHALL in the beginning of the sentence. It is important to require (SHALL be granted) the Oauth2.0.  Likewise it is important to mandate the app SHALL receiver the id_token.  </p>
<p><strong>Existing wording:</strong> The app MUST either be launched from the driving application following the SMART on FHIR EHR launch flow or the app may initiate the launch following the SMART on FHIR standalone launch. In either case, the app MUST request and be granted the fhircast OAuth2.0 scope. Accompanying this scope grant, the authorization server MUST supply the cast-hub and hub.topic SMART launch parameters alongside the access token. These parameters identify the Hub's base url, and a unique, opaque identifier of the current user's session, respectivly. Per SMART, when scopes of openid and fhirUser are granted, the app will additionally receive the current user's identity in an id_token.<br>
