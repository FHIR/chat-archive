<p>Hey @RicardoQuintano, </p>
<p>I specifically chose the female 3rd person pronoun when writing this sentence due to a mere personal tic of periodically and randomly ascribing the female genders to theoretical people. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/conformance-rules.html#conflang" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/conformance-rules.html#conflang">FHIR Conformance language</a> doesn't address this topic and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt" target="_blank" title="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a> is only about the actual conformance verbs to be used. </p>
<p>I'm a bit at a loss of how to figure out best practice for a formal technical specification's use of genderless pronouns in English. Even in informal English, this is a mess. Personally, I don't believe that they or their is a precise 2nd person pronoun. The distinction between 2nd and 3rd person is appropriate! Perhaps even more appropriate than the distinction between male and female genders. <span aria-label="thinking" class="emoji emoji-1f914" role="img" title="thinking">:thinking:</span> </p>
<p>Following a scan of the referenced links below, I'm more inclined towards your proposed change, but also don't see the harm in using the feminine posessive.  </p>
<p>Can you reference any definitive sources for justification of your proposed change?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi @isaacvetter ,</p>
<p>I proposed this update since the sentence "User temporarily suspended her session" is a formal description of the user-hibernate event and not just an example. Thus, in this case, I would expect a gender-neutral pronoun, since a user can be female or male.</p>
<p>In the Oxford dictionary I found (<a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/they" target="_blank" title="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/they">https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/they</a>) I found:<br>
"third person plural singular Used to refer to a person of unspecified gender.</p>
<p>‘ask a friend if they could help’ "</p>
<p>Another option could be to re-write the sentence. E.g. "User temporarily suspended her or his session" or "Users temporarily suspended their sessions" or "The session is temporarily suspended by the user".</p>
<p>I will check for more formal (definitive) sources for the "singular they" usage.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Ricardo</p>
