<blockquote>
<p>An application that is connected to a FHIR Cast session can access the FHIR repository, typically this access is read only. So far as I understand the EMR gathers all changes to the repo in its "context", based on changes in this context the CDS Hooks events are send.<br>
Based on this model, an application should be able to suggest changes to the context. This could be done using the FHIR Cast spec.<br>
I propose that we add a new event: fhir-change<br>
Event-name: fhir-change<br>
Context:<br>
    operation: create-update-delete<br>
    resouce: FHIR resource<br>
The list of resource updates will be included in the result of the rest interface.</p>

<p>Hey @bvdh <br>
I ran into a link to this github issue on a reply to my post on Zulip (in which you were mentioned).</p>
<p>I think this proposal is essential, or at least one or more events are essential for FHIRCast moving forward. A single event (fhir-change) is fine with me as long as I, as a subscriber, have an indication of what is being changed. For example, are additional exams being added? Prior exams being referenced? Measurements being taken, etc.</p>
<p>Could the <strong>operation</strong> element specify these kinds of things? </p>
<p>I'd be happy to collaborate on spec'ing out this new event.</p>
