<blockquote>
<p>Following ongoing conversation, there's not yet consensus that this change is necessary. The trade-off between convenience to implementer versus breaking compatibility with WebSub is a tough one. </p>
<p>I'm going to close this PR until there's been additional discussion on the best course of action. </p>
