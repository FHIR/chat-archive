<p>Hey Niklas, Fixed! Good catch. I mostly copied the <a href="https://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/#hook-maturity-model" target="_blank" title="https://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/#hook-maturity-model">CDS Hooks maturity model</a>. Our FHIRcast maturity model is defined as part of the core specification, here: <a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/blob/f421bcdda27e8221e776bd9c564114998ebfbc6b/docs/specification/STU1.md#event-maturity-model" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/blob/f421bcdda27e8221e776bd9c564114998ebfbc6b/docs/specification/STU1.md#event-maturity-model">https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/blob/f421bcdda27e8221e776bd9c564114998ebfbc6b/docs/specification/STU1.md#event-maturity-model</a></p>

<p>Few things:<br>
1. The JSON in the event examples isn't formatted (at least when I opened it for viewing) and instead shows up as one big section of text. Can we show it properly formatted to make it easier to read.<br>
2. The hub topics in the examples still use the url format rather than the GUID format you added in a recent PR.<br>
3. We call out the syncerror event as being infrastructural and not defined outside the spec like the others, yet it is still in the event catalog like the other events. Is that intended?</p>

<p>You mean the examples section on each event page, right? I see it as formatted when running locally, like this: <br>
![image](<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60514/64639991-aa931380-d3ce-11e9-8351-faf4efcdd31d.png" target="_blank" title="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60514/64639991-aa931380-d3ce-11e9-8351-faf4efcdd31d.png">https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60514/64639991-aa931380-d3ce-11e9-8351-faf4efcdd31d.png</a>)</p>
<p>And specifically, it's the "```json: markdown command that does this, for example, here: <a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/pull/276/files#diff-5f60a799e354568d9703b19519020082R22" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/pull/276/files#diff-5f60a799e354568d9703b19519020082R22">https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/pull/276/files#diff-5f60a799e354568d9703b19519020082R22</a></p>
<p>Any idea what might be causing you to see something different?</p>

<p>It was intended. I thought that it was important to document the same information. Do you think we should move it's documentation entirely into the base spec? The base spec does describe how to use it. </p>

<p>1. It must just be when you look at it in the "Files Changed" section. If that's how it looks when published then we are good.<br>
2. Cool<br>
3. Yeah that sounds good, I just wanted to confirm</p>
