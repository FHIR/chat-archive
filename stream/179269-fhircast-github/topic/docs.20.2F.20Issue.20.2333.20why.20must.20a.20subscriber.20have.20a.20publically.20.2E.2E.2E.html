<blockquote>
<p>During the HL7 working group meeting in May in Köln, there was strong feedback from @bvhd and @joshmandel a subscriber ought not to be required to host an accessible url. WebSub requires that the subscriber host an accessible url which receives notifications. </p>
<p>This requirement can dictate a subscriber's use of a client/server architecture. Alternatives could include using a long-running server/client communication method such as HTTP Long-Polling/Comet, HTML Server Sent Events (SSE) or websockets, thereby allowing the subscriber to not host a url accessible to the Hub. </p>
<p>The downside to these approaches is that the use of proxies (proxy or reverse proxy servers, firewalls, load-balancing routers and so on) between the browser and the Hub which are often designed for short-lived HTTP requests and multiple network hops increase the expense of keeping sockets.</p>
<p>Generally, long-polling is the most primitive and expensive method. Server-Sent Events are uni-directional (server-&gt;client) and further, are not supported by IE 10 or 11. Websockets is the server &lt;-&gt;client contender.</p>
<p>Is the use of websockets viable? Hosting FHIRcast applications within the same network as the Hub would help address common problems experienced due to proxies. What about a hub or client hosted within a multi-application/user app server, such as Citrix? -- a common deployment method for fat clients in healthcare. </p>

<p>Hey @jeremysrichardson !</p>
<p>If you're able and interested, code contributions definitely accepted for the <a href="https://github.com/fhircast/sandbox" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/fhircast/sandbox">sandbox</a>, we've even got a <a href="https://github.com/fhircast/sandbox/issues" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/fhircast/sandbox/issues">few open issues</a> following the connectathon last week.</p>
<p>SignalR is great, in large part because it <a href="https://kevgriffin.com/signalr-transports-explained/" target="_blank" title="https://kevgriffin.com/signalr-transports-explained/">handles the selection</a> of the actual over the wire transport protocol.  SignalR actually supports 3-4 different communication mechanisms and degrades gracefully through them. My take is that for bidirectional communication, websockets is the clear winner.</p>
<p>I'd suggest that a reason SignalR does this is because of the lack of support across clients and environments for websockets. </p>
<p>In your products that use SignalR, how often do they fall back to long-polling? Do you own the client and the server? Are both the client and the server within the intranet?</p>
