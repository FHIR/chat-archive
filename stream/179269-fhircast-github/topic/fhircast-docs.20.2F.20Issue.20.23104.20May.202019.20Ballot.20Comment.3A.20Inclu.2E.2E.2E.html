<p>Websocket options that where discussed include:<br>
1 STOMP<br>
2 basic websocket</p>
<p><strong>Basic requirements to be met with the web-socket solution:</strong><br>
1 Allow web-only clients to receive FHIR-Cast events.<br>
2 Allow to subscribe to events, unsubscribe from events.<br>
3 Only clients authorized for an event can receive it.<br>
4 Only clients authorized to send an event can send it.<br>
5 Easily implementable using available technologies</p>
<p><strong>STOMP</strong><br>
STOMP (<a href="https://stomp.github.io/" target="_blank" title="https://stomp.github.io/">https://stomp.github.io/</a>) supports all of these requirements out of the box. It is a full alternative to the web-sub approach and can be seen as an alternative implementation. Libraries are available for all common languages: <a href="https://stomp.github.io/implementations.html" target="_blank" title="https://stomp.github.io/implementations.html">https://stomp.github.io/implementations.html</a><br>
STOMP libraries typically have native support for authentication.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Websocket</strong><br>
This approach indicates websocket as an alternative channel for sending events. Subscribe/Unsubscribe to events is done using the WebSub pattern. Additional specification is required to verify that the receiver is the one that made the request and is the only one that can receive the events. The websocket URL would be unique for each client and difficult to guess in order to prevent that unauthorized clients can connect.<br>
A pattern that could work could be something like the following:<br>
  A-&gt;B : POST with channel = websocket<br>
  Return -&gt;  202 Accepted – include websocket URL to be used.<br>
  A-&gt;B: connect to websocket URL<br>
  B-&gt;B detects websocket connection<br>
  B -&gt; A: send intent verification (over websocket)<br>
  A-&gt;B: send verification response (REST-full or over websocket?)<br>
This approach will also cover the requirements but does require further FHIRCast specific specification and verification effort.</p>
<p>Based on an ease of implementation and specification effort, the STOMP approach would have my preference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bas, Isaac</p>
<p>I need to read through this all more carefully, but just for starters:</p>
<p>Regarding the websocket connection and validation:</p>
<p>The important thing that isn't mentioned here is the authentication<br>
mechanism and how it relates to obtaining a "topic" (or user session). We<br>
discussed this in great detail at the last connectathon.</p>
<p>Once a client has authenticated and receives a topic, it can establish a<br>
secure websocket connection with the hub. It simply uses an "application<br>
secret" in the bearer authentication header and a topic. The hub can easily<br>
validate this identity and allow/disallow the connection, correct? I don't<br>
see the need for the protocol you provided in the "basic" approach.</p>
<p>This is what I've implemented in out prototype. I proposed it a while ago<br>
in Zulip:</p>
<p>1. Client calls a GetTopic RESTful method on the authentication server<br>
(which is our hub). It sends an application secret and a user name. The<br>
user name is configured somewhere is persistent storage, in our case an SQL<br>
table, and it is associated with a randomly created topic (another<br>
discussion: these topics should probably be automatically recreated<br>
periodically as an additional security precaution).</p>
<p>We envision this current implementation moving to an OAuth version and<br>
hopefully standardizing on email addresses as identifiers for radiologists<br>
across applications (PACS, RIS, etc.)</p>
<p>2. If the application secret and the user name jive, the topic is returned<br>
to the client.</p>
<p>3. The client then subscribes to the hub using the application secret (in<br>
the header) and topic, and specifying the websocket channel type</p>
<p>4. The client establishes a websocket connection with the hub using the<br>
hub's base url and the topic as an endpoint, like<br>
wss://fhirhub.company.com/&lt;topic<br>
goes here&gt;. The hub can re-authenticate the topic as belonging to the<br>
application identified by the secret, reasonably assuring that this<br>
connection attempt is valid.</p>
<p>I think that limiting websocket use to where it is needed (events only)<br>
would help keep the implementation "clean" with respect to the RESTful<br>
spec. Remember, as Martin recommended, we also wrap our websocket messages<br>
in an object that contains a "header" and "body" which also aids in that<br>
effort. The header will always contain the app secret. The body will<br>
contain a notification event which will have an ID (defined by the<br>
publisher) and a timestamp.</p>

<p>Yes, in step 4, the hub checks that the application secret and topic are<br>
valid (using the authentication data in the DB using our implementation). I<br>
see how that is not exactly elegant, and I am open to any suggestion. The<br>
problem is I don't understand how STOMP is doing for us. You mention the<br>
steps:</p>
<p>1. A-&gt;B : POST with channel = websocket<br>
   2. Return -&gt; 202 Accepted – include websocket URL to be used.<br>
   3. A-&gt;B: connect to websocket URL<br>
   4. B-&gt;B detects websocket connection<br>
   5. B -&gt; A: send intent verification (over websocket)<br>
   6. A-&gt;B: send verification response (REST-full or over websocket?)<br>
   - How does STOMP accomplish this for us? Can you provide a pseudo-code<br>
   example possibly (don't go to a lot of effort)<br>
   - I assume step 1 is the RESTful call to subscribe, and the hub would<br>
   return an endpoint similar to our implementation using some unique id?<br>
   - What is step 5-6? After step 4 isn't everything done?<br>
   - Sending and acknowledging events (although another "topic") still<br>
   needs to be considered. How will STOMP work compared to a simple JSON<br>
   approach?</p>
<p>I will need to read more about it, but steps 1-4 seem like what we are<br>
doing, the only difference being the hub returns the endpoint in the<br>
Subscribe (which I like - I should have done that to begin with).</p>
<p>Like I said, I'm open, but I was very intimidated by STOMP when I looked at<br>
it. It seemed like a lot of work.</p>

<p>STOMP is a full alternative to the websub specification. Implementing it from scratch will be more work than the Basic Websocket approach. Implementing it based on libraries is a lot easier because a lot of the current websocket deployments are using STOMP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bas, Can a client communicate to a FHIRCast hub that is implemented using<br>
STOMP, without using STOMP itself?</p>
<p>- If a vendor doesn't want to use a third party library, can they simply<br>
   send messages to the hub per the STOMP format/spec? I realize that this<br>
   would be re-building the STOMP library (or a small subset of it).<br>
   - What does STOMP do other than support a message format and initial<br>
   handshaking, and is that in a spec?<br>
   - The FHIR data is represented in JSON or XML. It would remain that way<br>
   embedded in a STOMP message, correct?</p>
<p>I don't know if I'm making sense, because I haven't researched STOMP fully<br>
- I am starting on it this morning.</p>
<p>I don't think Nuance will have a problem with the third party library as<br>
long as it is open source, but I'm concerned someone might.</p>
<p>Thanks very much!</p>
