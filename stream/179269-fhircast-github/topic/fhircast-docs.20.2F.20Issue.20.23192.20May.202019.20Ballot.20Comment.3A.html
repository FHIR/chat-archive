<p>## Montreal May 2019 Working Group Vote</p>
<p>Isaac moved the following disposition, seconded by Niklas</p>
<p>Disposition: Persuasive with mod<br>
Disposition Comment: Will update the MUST to SHALL and will leave the error description as a SHOULD because of errors with authentication, for example, and because it follows the web sub model.</p>
