<blockquote>
<p>Hey Anthony and @isaacvetter, I am only seeing one change in the proposed wording, the MUST changing to SHALL in the second line. Seems like this was intended to change more  (maybe the other MUST to SHALL as well?). Also it sounds like there may be concerns with sending subsets of FHIR resources or am I reading the comment wrong?</p>

<strong>Type:</strong> NEG <span aria-label="exclamation" class="emoji emoji-2757" role="img" title="exclamation">:exclamation:</span> Clarification<br>
<strong>In Person requested:</strong> Yes :bust_in_silhouette: </p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> One again:  the second sentence asy the fields within context are subsets of FHIR resources. Then it sasy for open-image-study it should send the ImagingStudy FHIR resource. </p>
<p><strong>Existing wording:</strong> FHIR is the interoperable data model used by FHIRcast. The fields within context are subsets of FHIR resources. Hubs MUST send the results of FHIR reads in the context, as specified below. For example, when the open-image-study event occurs, the notification sent to a subscriber MUST include the ImagingStudy FHIR resource. Hubs SHOULD send the results of an ImagingStudy FHIR read using the _elements query parameter, like so: ImagingStudy/{id}?_elements=identifier,accession and in accordance with the FHIR specification. <br>
