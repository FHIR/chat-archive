<blockquote>
<p>Not unlike issue #33 (why must a subscriber have an accessible URL?), we want to implement FHIRCast as a context sharing mechanism between our Windows desktop application (C# forms app) and other third party apps (mostly PACS). I started looking at WebSockets thinking it may solve our problem, but it really doesn't. While we could use the WebSocket as a means for the hub to notify the client (real time) of events, we still can't allow the hub to send sensitive information over that WebSocket and still be secure.</p>
<p>I started thinking that we could have "limited" event data posted to the client over the WebSocket, where only some notification id is sent - nothing sensitive. Then the client could issue a query request to the hub (over secure HTTPS) to obtain the event data (eg. rest hook method GetEvent(int notificationId). But, this would require a new extension to FHIRCast, and it also goes against the WebSub specification intent - correct?</p>
<p>Additionally, the WebSub specification requires that subscriptions have a callback verification (see related issue #27 Callback URL Verification). Unless we change that specification making that callback optional, the client still needs to have a secure HTTPS accessible URL. We could say the verification payload contains NO sensitive data, and host the callback url on insecure HTTP, but I don't know if that is wise.   </p>
<p>If we are going to consider the option of non-conformance with WebSub (which I have no problem with), and extending the FHIRCast specification to add event queries, I suggest we consider the following proposal:</p>
<p>1. Allow a subscriber to send a subscription parameter indicating that its callback URL is not secure, and all content (including the verification) WILL NOT contain sensitive information.</p>
<p>2. When an event occurs for such a subscriber, the Hub will send a "safe" notification event which will contain an id referencing the event.</p>
<p>3. The client then gets the notification event details using the new rest-hook method, eg. GetEvent(int notificationId). </p>
<p>Another option for us is to implement a "broker" as described by @RazStorm in issue #27. This would allow us to conform to all WebSub specifications, and would not require additional Hub methods. However, this would be a much more complex solution for us (and other PACS vendors) to implement. The broker would essentially implement the above proposal, and it would have to maintain routing, authorization and notification to all of the clients in its domain. It's also another point of failure added to the equation.</p>

<p>So to conclude, I have to ask, why do we need conformance with WebSub? It is a great model for what FHIRCast is designed for (subscription/publication), but FHIRCast doesn't NEED to be WebSub compatible, does it? Does the FHIR specification say so? If it doesn't, I suggest we consider the following proposal or something similar:</p>
<p>1. Allow a subscriber to send a subscription parameter indicating that its callback URL is not secure, and all content (including the verification) WILL NOT contain sensitive information. The hub will return a response containing a unique subscription id if the subscription succeeds.</p>
<p>2. When an event occurs for such a subscriber, the Hub will send a "safe" notification event which will contain an id referencing the event notification.</p>
<p>3. The client then gets the notification event details using the new rest-hook method, eg. GetEvent(int notificationId). </p>
<p>4. All other protocols would remain the same.</p>
<p>Another option for us is to implement a "broker" as described by @RazStorm in issue #27. This would allow us to conform to all WebSub specifications, and would not require additional Hub methods.

<p>Looking further into it I believe I was incorrect. It doesn't appear that<br>
the WSS client requires a certificate as long as the WSS server has a valid<br>
third party cert. This would be acceptable to us. I have to re-think<br>
(again!).</p>
