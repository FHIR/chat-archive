<blockquote>
<p>As part of the standalone launch flow described in PR #25, it seems reasonable to enable the subscribing app to <em>create</em> a session, if it doesn't already exist for the authenticating user. </p>
<p>A context notification message, sent by the subscribing app to the Hub, should cause the driving app to open. </p>

<p>It would be useful if there was a mechanism like the CCOW launch mechanism where if a 'driving app' sets the context on a subscribing app it would open that app, 'tuned' to the correct user and patient (and other context subjects as appropriate).    This would allow for the use case of an 'app framework' which can control the launching of the EMR as 'just another peer' in the 'shared context', and not as the 'master' of the context.   [Not sure of the technical issues around OAuth 2.0 tokens, but the CCOW standard had a concept called 'chain of trust' so that all the peers participating in the shared context trusted each other by some 'out-of-band' pre-arrangement of trust.]</p>

<p>Hey @johns397 - indeed. PR <a href="https://github.com/fhircast/docs/pull/36" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/fhircast/docs/pull/36">#36</a> is intended to provide this capability, although it's implemented slightly differently than how you/CCOW suggest. </p>
