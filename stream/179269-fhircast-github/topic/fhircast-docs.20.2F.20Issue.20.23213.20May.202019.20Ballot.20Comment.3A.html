<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Chaos reigns.  Events should be an extensible value set.  Otherwise each implementor will define event xyz with different meaning - resulting in lack of interoperability.</p>
<p><strong>Existing wording:</strong> The name of the event SHOULD succinctly and clearly describe the activity or event. Event names are unique so event creators SHOULD take care to ensure newly proposed events do not conflict with an existing event name. Event creators SHALL name their event with reverse domain notation (e.g. org.example.patient-transmogrify) if the event is specific to an organization. Reverse domain notation SHALL not be used by a standard event catalog.<br>

<p>Hey Anthony,</p>
<p>I'd like to suggest that this negative comment should be resolved by defining, in the specification, the process and documentation template for defining and maturing new events. And that each event be maturable, indepedent of the specification or unrelated events.</p>
