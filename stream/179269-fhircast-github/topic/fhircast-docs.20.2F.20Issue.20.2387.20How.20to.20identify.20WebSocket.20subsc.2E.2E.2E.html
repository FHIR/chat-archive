<blockquote>
<p>Up until now, I have been using a hack to unsubscribe my websocket client from the hub: I simply close the websocket, which triggers the hub to remove the websocket from it's collection of connections, and remove the subscription that is referenced by that connection item.</p>
<p>This shouldn't be a permanent solution. There needs to be a unique identifier (as the hub.callback is required to be, and is used by the current RESTful sandbox implementations).</p>
<p>Should we use the hub.callback and create a unique url for identification purposes? It could be generated using the client's IP address and port in order to keep it unique?</p>
