<p>From an EMR/UI perspective, open, switch and close patient are understandable. From an application subscribed to FHIRCast events the difference between open and switch is small.</p>
<p>On open, the new patient/study will be the main one.<br>
On switch, the existing patient/study will be the main one.<br>

<p>Switch has the same connotation as open without a close of the current patient, forcing the application to listen to switch as well as open. The action it would take would be the same.<br>

<p>Hey @bvdh ,</p>
<p>Great points. The list of events was informed by current state integrations. I agree with everything you say, above. </p>
<p>In production, applications and clinical workflow can:<br>
1) Only ever have a single patient's record open at a time. <br>
2) Support having multiple patients "open", but only ever one in focus.<br>
3) Support having multiple patients in focus.<br>
4) Support having no patients in focus. </p>
<p>For scenario (2), how can we enable synchronization between two apps which are both capable of having multiple patients "open", but only ever one in focus?</p>
<p>For scenario (4), how can we enable synchronization where the one app has multiple patients "open", but the user moves to an activity with no patients in focus?</p>
<p>We could:<br>
1) Drop the switch events now.<br>
2) Move the event catalog out of the spec, so that it can mature indepdently.<br>
3) Figure this out during the May connectathon and ballot resolution.</p>
<p><em>Would you be willing to submit this as a ballot comment?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'll file all open ticket here as a ballot topics.</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, based on the comments you provided, we might need to expand the events to reflect the state of the application. I understand that a patient/study can be open. Zero, one or more patients/studies can be in focus.<br>
Maybe we should have the following events:<br>
   open-patient/open-study<br>
   close-patient/close-study<br>
   focus-change : lists the current patient/studies in focus.<br>
The reason for the last event to be separate is that we can signal both states separately. The reason for providing a focus list instead of individual events is that it forces application to consider that fact that there can be more than one patient in focus.<br>
Any thoughts?</p>
