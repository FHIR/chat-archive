<blockquote>
<p>Hey @jeremysrichardson ,</p>
<p>We finally wrote up, reviewed, approved and merged the content in this page: <a href="http://fhircast.org/launch-scenarios/" target="_blank" title="http://fhircast.org/launch-scenarios/">http://fhircast.org/launch-scenarios/</a> as part of PR #25. </p>
<p>A session identifier is communicated as one of the SMART launch parameters. And the app can be launched using either SMART's so-called "EHR Launch" or the "Standalone launch". </p>
<p>I _think_ that resolved this issue.</p>
<p>Isaac</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When looking at <a href="http://FHIRCast.org" target="_blank" title="http://FHIRCast.org">FHIRCast.org</a>, it was unclear to me how a subscribing client knows where a server lives.</p>
<p>From the primary use case, the FHIRCast server is always the launching server, and could pass the location to the FHIRCast server in the launch call.  If there are N apps in a hospital, each of them could have their own FHIRCast/FHIR Subscription w UserSession server.</p>
<p>In a stand-alone launch call, it's less clear.  If each app has its own UserSession, then they won't talk to each other.  Talking to Isaac (Connectahon 1/27), he thinks it's implementation configuration (Seems obvious, right?)  However, I think this is a key assumption that should be called out, and leads to the problem that the different apps need to share a common UserSession: a simple solution is a SINGLE pre-defined FHIRCast server to allow stand-alone apps to share context.</p>
<p>I think we should make this explicit for both launch types...</p>
