<p>Hey @thorstenconrad ,</p>
<p>Apologies for the delayed, delayed response to this. </p>
<p>In WebSub, a subscriber following redirects particularly makes sense because the subscriber doesn't particularly care which hub it's getting updates from. </p>
<p>In FHIRcast, the subscriber is presenting a bearer token to the Hub. The subscriber is responsible for protecting its bearer token and it should not share it with any third-party. </p>
<p>Further, the subscriber was explicitly told which endpoint (<code>hub.topic</code> url) at which to initiate a subscription. Note that this is the case both in WebSub and FHIRcast. WebSub includes support for redirects, not to solve the "trailing slash" problem, but rather to federate Hubs. </p>
<p>Why shouldn't the subscriber always expect the <code>hub.topic</code> url that it receives in the SMART app launch to always be correct (including the appropriate presence or absence of a trailing slash as required)?</p>
<p>Isaac</p>
