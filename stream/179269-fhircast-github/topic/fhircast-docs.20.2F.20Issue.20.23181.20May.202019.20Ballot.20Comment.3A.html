<p><strong>Comment:</strong> It is not typical to put conformance statements in an overview.  The overview should tell me what this thing is about.  Since this is a stand-alone document not included in FHIR, the overview should introduce the topic, as well as set the expectations for the rest of the document.  In addition, it is necessary to either define the abbreviations such as app, or include a glossary. </p>

<p>During conversation at the Montreal, May 2019 working group meeting, @wdbr, @wmaethner, @NiklasSvenzen and myself talked through this issue and would like to propose:</p>
<p>We will add a "abstract" section at the beginning of the specification page to make it more accessible, with liberal re-use from the Security Considerations page. Further, we will also re-use or create a flow diagram for this section. We believe this also addresses:  #175 </p>
<p><strong>Proposed resolution:</strong> Persuasive</p>

<p>FHIRcast enables the synchronization of healthcare applications user interfaces in real-time through the exchange of a workflow event to a small number of disparate applications.
