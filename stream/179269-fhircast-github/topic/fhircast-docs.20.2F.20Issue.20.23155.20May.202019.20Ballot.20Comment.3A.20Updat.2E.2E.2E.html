<p>"An application that is connected to a FHIR Cast session can access the FHIR repository, typically this access is read only. So far as I understand the EMR gathers all changes to the repo in its "context", based on changes in this context the CDS Hooks events are send.<br>
Based on this model, an application should be able to suggest changes to the context. This could be done using the FHIR Cast spec.<br>
I propose that we add a new event: fhir-change<br>

resouce: FHIR resource<br>
The list of resource updates will be included in the result of the rest interface."</p>

<p>During conversation at the Montreal, May 2019 working group meeting, @RicardoQuintano, @wmaethner, @NiklasSvenzen and myself talked through this issue and would like to:</p>
<p>@bvdh, we really are looking at this type of idea, a specific example is #250</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Resolution:</strong> Not persuasive. This is a great idea, just outside of 1.0 scope. </p>

<strong>Type:</strong> A-S Enhancement</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Update the context with FHIR resources</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Issue/comment imported from <a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/issues/72" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/issues/72">https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/issues/72</a> </p>
<p>"An application that is connected to a FHIR Cast session can access the FHIR repository, typically this access is read only. So far as I understand the EMR gathers all changes to the repo in its "context", based on changes in this context the CDS Hooks events are send.<br>
Based on this model, an application should be able to suggest changes to the context. This could be done using the FHIR Cast spec.<br>
I propose that we add a new event: fhir-change<br>
Event-name: fhir-change<br>
Context:<br>
operation: create-update-delete<br>
resouce: FHIR resource<br>
The list of resource updates will be included in the result of the rest interface."</p>
