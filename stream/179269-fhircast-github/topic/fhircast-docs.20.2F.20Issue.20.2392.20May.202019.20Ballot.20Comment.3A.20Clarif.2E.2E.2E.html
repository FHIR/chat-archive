<p>## May 2019 Ballot Comment: Clarify that Hub isn't responsible for tracking client querystring parameters on updated callback url. </p>
<p>Submitted by @MichaelTClifton on behalf of @isaacvetter (<a href="mailto:isaac@epic.com" title="mailto:isaac@epic.com">isaac@epic.com</a> )<br>

<strong>Url:</strong> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> A-S Clarification</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Clarify that Hub isn't responsible for tracking client querystring parameters on updated callback url. </p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> It's a little ambiguous what "new parameters" actually refers to here. The WebSub intent is to preserve client defined querystring params when the Hub adds it's own params. The Hub isn't responsible for tracking previous client-defined params and combining those with new, client-defined params. </p>
<p><strong>Existing wording:</strong> Hubs MUST preserve the query string during subscription verification by appending new parameters to the end of the list using the &amp; (ampersand) character to join.<br>
<strong>Proposed wording:</strong> Hubs MUST preserve the query string during subscription verification by appending new, Hub-defined parameters to the end of the list using the &amp; (ampersand) character to join.</p>
