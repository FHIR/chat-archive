<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Provide example topics to support drug and medical device research.</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> It wold be useful to create example hub topics to support events based on safety for outcome research related to the use registries. For instance if a medication or device is selected in the "driving app" (e.g. an EHR) the registry/"synchronized app" could show associated safety or recall events associated with the selected "Medication" or "Device".</p>

<p>In discussion with @wmaethner , @NiklasSvenzen , @lbergnehr we talked through this issue. As part of this ballot, we'll be modifying the syntax of events as well as creating a process for the definition of events. Events based upon specific use-cases, such as device recall checking could be enabled through this mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Resolution:</strong> Persuasive with Mod<br>
<strong>Proposed Resolution comment:</strong> Although we're not creating specific events for Terrie's defined use-cases, we are enabling multiple use-cases. </p>
