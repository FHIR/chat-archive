<p>Yeah this seems easier in the long run to maintain, although I still like the idea of creating releases each time we do publish a major version (or a ballot like we already have for the May ballot). They will be nice to have as a backup and maybe we do find a way to use them in the future.</p>

<p>Hey @wmaethner - agreed! I did also create a "draft" STU1 release this morning, see here: <a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/releases" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/releases">https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/releases</a></p>
<p>Hopefully this should remind us to apply it as part of our eventual publish.</p>
