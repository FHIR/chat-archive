<p>## May 2019 Ballot Comment: Do other susbcribers need to know the identity of the originator of a broadcasted sync-error notification?</p>

<strong>Chapter/section:</strong>  Event Notification Errors<br>
<strong>Url:</strong> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> A-Q Correction</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Do other susbcribers need to know the identity of the originator of a broadcasted sync-error notification?</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> If a Hub forwards a sync-error event to other subscribers, how do the other subscribers recognize which system has the sync-error? E.g. EHR driving, PACS, dictation and reporting systems subscribing. The dictation system sends the EHR Hub a sync-error notification, which is then broadcast to the PACS and reporting subscribers. Does these subscribers need to know that it was the dictation system that errored? The Hub knows the identity of each subscriber due to the bearer token. To answer this question, we should determine what the other subscribers want to do with the notification.</p>
<p><strong>Existing wording:</strong> The Hub MAY use these events to track synchronization state and MAY also forward these events to other subscribers of the same topic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is important is to be able to notify an end user that there are applications out of sync. Not necessarily all the intricate details of which application or why. Most applications dealing with patients are required to have a patient banner, so it is easy for an end user to figure out which application is out of sync, the important thing is to know when to look.</p>
