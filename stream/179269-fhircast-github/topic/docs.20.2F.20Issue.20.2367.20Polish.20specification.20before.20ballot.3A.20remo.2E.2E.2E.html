<blockquote>
<p>@bvhd analyzed our specification during the January HL7 WGM in San Antonio and provided some sigificant, detailed analysis and feedback. </p>
<p>Two broad themes of Bas's feedback include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The specification is written as a story or narrative or use-case, not as a specification.</li>
<li>Better use &amp; explanation of mandatory text</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, it's also difficult for the reader to determine what content is informative and what content is specification. </p>
<p>To address these issues, I'm going to split the narrative out of the specification and add an overview page and then specifically label the specification as version 1.0 (with a notice that it's still in draft).</p>
<p>@bvhd - as always, would love your feedback.</p>
