<p>Hi, I've just sent an e-mail to various contacts I have with persons representing (or being actively involved in) HL7 Denmark to explore how we could cooperate around the deliviry of HL7 (FHIR / v2 / CDA) training courses in Denmark. The interest in FHIR appears to be increasing so I hope some form of cooperation will be possible. </p>

<p>Hi René - as soon as I saw your mail I went to fetch the URL to the danish group that I've created here. I wanted to forward that in the mail but now, as you may have noticed I've already created the danish group. Surely, the consultancy of Ringholm could be useful to some of the participating actors here in DK</p>

<p>So by all means - welcome ;)</p>
