<p>One of the things we talked about this week was <a href="http://build.fhir.org/credits.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/credits.html">http://build.fhir.org/credits.html</a> – we update it towards the end of publishing our milestone releases. There’s so many (100s) of individuals and organizations that we need to add to it… it's out of control</p>

<p>any thoughts as to what we should do with it?</p>

<p>I think it's important: as you know - and I often say - our real treasure is the FHIR community...</p>

<p>I used to drive some of the reporting based on commit volume, but SVN gave up the ghost on being able to report that a while ago - and it's complicated by our switch to SVN.  I can run a report that identifies primary raisers of tracker issues.  I also used to add the organizations that had signed up for connectathons - but that too is getting to be extreme.</p>

<p>We can use commit history in GitHub going back to 2013, too.</p>

<p>I’ll note that committer is a subset of contributors. Many people contribute who don’t have committer rights. Not that that makes your cleanup any easier.</p>
