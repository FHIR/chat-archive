<p>Spreadsheet is a bear... Does row 44 "Resource Scopes approved by FMG" have to do with the original approval of the resource?  IF so ... why is that even there?</p>

<p>Yes, spreadsheet is indeed a bear.  There's a separate page for resource scopes and it's distinct from resource approval.  It means agreeing on all possible use-cases intended to be covered by the resource and confirmation that we've indeed exercised that full range.  Take a look at Patient as an example.</p>

<p>So FMM reviews the proposed resource scope at the beginning- do they go back an review it again?  </p>

<p>Work group is expected to fill out the second tab of the QA spreadsheet with their full list of scopes and how each was tested.  FMG reviews and verifies they're confident that the scopes sufficiently cover the expected breadth of the resource and that there are no additional scopes that could potentially fall within the resource that are still unassigned.  For example, MedicationAdministration is unlikely to hit FMM 4 until HL7 has figured out where radiation therapy and blood transfusions and a few other things are supposed to live.</p>

<p>Yes, this is going to hold some PA resources up also.</p>
