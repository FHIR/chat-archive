<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  Why is the priority in the request pattern a code with fixed binding to a fhir based codeset that is essentially a poor cousin of the V3 Act priority set?http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActPriority/vs.html<br>
In the Encounter resource PA has used a codeable concept against this existing v3 valueset (example binding)<br>
I think in PA we would be happy to tighten this binding up to be preferred, but think that dropping back to the limitted set as a code without being able to provide local or extended bindings just seems wrong.</p>

<p>I think because all the places that had priority at the time we created the pattern had that as a binding.  Fine if we want to revisit that valueset and/or binding.  (I think striving for a common binding that most systems can count on/map to would be useful though.)</p>
