<p>I have a lot of tasks where the report is fairly concise, and though I think I know what the problem is, reproducing it is not at all obvious, since it's embedded deep inside a particular IG, and sometimes people work around it. is it practical and reasonable to require that people commit an example of the IG that is broken to their repository, tag that, and then record the tag n the task, so that I can just grab a copy of that particular version, and recreate it instantly? it can take 20-30 minutes to recreate something....</p>

<p>I think that is reasonable -- it is a legitimate use of git branches and forks to recreate broken changes/states for issue reporting.</p>
