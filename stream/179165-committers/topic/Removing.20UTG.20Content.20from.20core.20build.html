<p>Did I miss an announcement related to "removing UTG Content from core build"?  Following <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> 's changes a couple weeks ago, <a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhir/commit/5c0494aacfd0b8bd52bc72c587aa89d0a64246f8#diff-7d6112d906f06fde02ecf08edc8a67c8">https://github.com/HL7/fhir/commit/5c0494aacfd0b8bd52bc72c587aa89d0a64246f8#diff-7d6112d906f06fde02ecf08edc8a67c8</a>, it seems like the codesystem files have been removed from the source resource folders.  Are work groups still able to update the code systems?  If so, how?  For example, I am trying to apply <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-26464">J#26464</a> to update the definitions of codes, but I can't find the codesystem file that I would have previously edited.</p>

<p>ths simplest way for now is to get a copy of UTG - it's a FHIR IG - and just do what you were going to and build UTG locally. it takes about the same time as the main build anyway</p>

<p>It was according to the long standing UTG agreement, where the only code systems that remain in FHIR are those used in a required binding to a element of type code - those stay in FHIR; everything else goes to UTG</p>

<p>That's an open discussion. It looks to me, based on current discussion, that, </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>for ValueSets, IGs will be able to define their own value sets, but shared ones will be in UTG. note, though, that HTA has jurisdiction over external code system usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for Code systems, I don't yet have a sense of that. IG authors would like to be able to do whatever they want, but I think that an additional quality process is justified for non-draft/experimental code systems. Whether that's UTG... I'm not clear yet</p>

<p>for Concept Maps: we haven't had enough discussion for me to have any sense about this</p>

<p>Part of the issue is that FHIR itself hasn't had great governance over experimental/draft artifacts.  We don't properly differentiate what's fake/temporary/work-in-progress from what's well baked and stable.  (In my IGs I've recently started dumping all my 'temp' codes into a single code system with the id 'temp' and a description that makes very clear that "these codes are expected to move somewhere official, once we're sure that a) they say what we want; and b) that we gain consensus on where the appropriate long-term home is".  I suspect that the vocab WG would be much less anxious about a single massive FHIR 'temp' code system full of miscellaneous junk.  We could then enforce a build rule that artifacts with FMM3+ weren't allowed to point to 'temp'.</p>

<p>Sorry I have not been on this thread been buried with other burning crises...where to begin...we have both the flag for experimental and the version ID element to clearly and processably indicate whether something is 'temporary' or not.     The UTG system and process is live, about a half dozen proposals have gone completely through the consensus process and been implemented to the source of truth for the UTG ci build.    The documentation for everything is on Confluence, and it would probably be best to start at <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/VOC/Vocabulary+Maintenance+at+HL7">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/VOC/Vocabulary+Maintenance+at+HL7</a> from where all the documentation and training stuff can be found.  We have not yet made final decisions on removal of stuff that has been published for years in v3 and v2, and we know that some of the experimental stuff from FHIR has been imported; we may either remove this or sequester it somewhere, or flag it so it can be excluded from production builds.     Folks can begin putting changes through the process and we will do our very best in supporting them if any difficulties are encountered.  We will have discussions on much of this in the UTG and FHIR-I/Vocab sessions this week.</p>

<p>Value sets <em>never</em> need to be defined in UTG.  They <em>can</em> be defined in UTG if there's an expectation that they'll either be shared by IGs that won't have a dependency on the originating IG or will be shared by artifacts across product families.</p>
<p>If the maturity level of the IG/referencing profile is &lt;3, code systems don't need to be in UTG, though they should have an id that makes clear that they are temporary.  For more mature artifacts, I believe we'd agreed to add a special 'examples' code system to UTG where we'd have a lighter-weight process for introducing content.  The code system would have a URL that would make it clear the codes shouldn't ever be used in production.</p>

<p>Just this morning all the vocab chairs came to consensus agreement for new temporary URIs for external code systems that are still in work by HTA for final authoritative URI values would be: <br>
<a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/temporary-uri/codeSystem/xxx">http://terminology.hl7.org/temporary-uri/codeSystem/xxx</a> for code systems, and <br>
<a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/temporary-uri/valueSet/xxx">http://terminology.hl7.org/temporary-uri/valueSet/xxx</a> if it is needed for value sets.   We did not move the discussion further as to whether this refers to any new code system that it is unknown if it will live or be temporary for examples, etc. (we got tied up in other related discussions).   Thus I do think we need to come to agreement on whether or not to use this for the example IG items that this thread began asking about.   I could not get decision on the process and steps (yet) for what these string values should be for IG developers to use so they know how to move forward, despite my getting very unpleasant on the caller being too implementation-focussed.

<p>I think the 'example' code system approach should be different.  Codes under the temporary-uri are expected to be moved elsewhere eventually.  On the other hand, 'example' codes aren't expected to be moved anywhere, ever.  Personally, I'm not totally clear on the value of putting example codes in UTG at all - I think the value of a single code system containing a grab bag of arbitrary examples from a wide range of IGs is likely to be quite limited - and that we'd be better off saying that such things can simply be defined within the referencing IG, with the only requirement that the URL make very clear that the codes should never appear in production systems.</p>

<p>I think that FHIR core committers who need to create code systems (and a corresponding include all value set) to provide example bindings in their resources should not need to create these in UTG.  I see zero value in doing so.  As Lloyd said, these are not going to be real codes that will move to some real code system in the future.  These are purely fake codes being created to show examples of codes in a resource.</p>

<p>The vocab chairs had an active call on this yesterday.    I doh't believe we yet have a firm decision.    On the one hand, keeping bogus content and dross out of THO is wise, but on the other hand the whole purpose of standing yup the web pages IG for it is so folks can share and not always have to create their own, with a single place to look for stuff.     My PERSONAL OPINION is that we should have a tab for Example content on THO, and for code systems whose entire content is only to support examples and is never intended to be used in a production system we have a CodeSystem.status code value to indicate Example not for production use (which seems to me to be in the similar semantic space as something like 'experimental' which exists as a code in the PublicationStatus code system).   For the ValueSet resources which are only Example content, I would opine we do the same with an appropriate code added to PublicationStatus  that then can be used in ValueSet.status the exact same way.</p>

<p>There's no need to "look for stuff" if it's example content.  There's no need for re-use, and in general, we don't <em>want</em> re-use because the codes themselves are bogus and tuned for specific use-cases.

<p>My preferred policy would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the value set is used only in elements of type 'code' (which by definition requires a 'required' binding, then the code system can be defined in core/in the IG and need never go into UTG.  (E.g. status, gender, etc.)</li>
<li>if the value set is only used with a binding strength of example, then the code system can be defined in core/in the IG but must have a URL that follows an approved convention and makes it obvious that the codes are example-only and should not be used in production.  The validator will spit out warning if it sees them, warning that they can't be used in production</li>
<li>if the value set is being used only in artifacts with maturity of FMM 2 or less (core or IG) , the code system can be a core/IG-specific code system.  However, that code system must follow a URL pattern that clearly marks the codes as 'temporary'.  The validator will throw an error if a binding to that code system appears in any artifact with a maturity of FMM 3+</li>
</ul>
<p>The outcome of this is:</p>
<ul>
<li>no overhead for purely example codes</li>
<li>no overhead for low maturity codes</li>
<li>we still get codes into UTG for the codes that matter</li>
</ul>

<p>Mostly agree Lloyd, but Melva's Use Case is an example value set which includes real SCT codes.   We do have to explore the corner cases here.</p>

<p>If there's no codes to define, should be no issue.  Valuesets <em>never</em> have to be defined in UTG.  Work group needs to consciously decide that the value set is intended to be shared for that to happen.</p>

<p>I didn't say it contained real SCT codes.  I said we use SCT where we can for example bindings, but where there isn't a valid hierarchy, we create a value set with example codes in it.</p>

<p>We have a Vocab co-chairs call and an additional "External code system identifier subgroup" call scheduled on Monday.  We can further discuss it then.  Personally, I think we may be making this problem to some degree larger than it really needs to be.  Along with Ted, I'm largely in agreement with Lloyd's preferred policy suggestions.  I'm not quite sure, though, if the items that he described as "must" might not alternatively be "should" - at least for now, until we do come to an agreement on Lloyd's suggestions (or something similar) as being the official policy.  And in the meantime, is it really beneficial to hold up the changes that are needing to be made by Melva and others in the core spec?  And if it happens to end up taking a while longer to decide on the final policy, and the changes that were made under the current "rules" would end up making it into R4B (wherever that may be applicable) - then maybe we could agree that we can live with that, and then begin applying the new finalized policy for whatever further changes will be made from that point forward which will end up in R5 (or later)?  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191982">@Ted Klein</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="195036">@Carol Macumber</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192130">@Carmela Couderc</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191333">@Reuben Daniels</span></p>

<p>I don't think these are rules that belong in the core spec at all.  They're methodology rules on HL7 IG developers, not something relevant to implementers.</p>

<p>As I brought up on the Monday evening "external code system identifier" call, I believe it will be true that <strong>most</strong> (not all) instances of creating new code systems and value sets that are bound as example will still likely be in the core spec.  When you are developing an <strong>implementation</strong> guide, you are going to typically want to constrain the existing example bindings in the core spec to at least preferred (or stronger), whenever possible, and you probably won't (or shouldn't be) creating very many (or any) <strong>new</strong> code systems and value sets that are bound as example, because by definition those are meant to be only examples and are not intended to be implemented.</p>

<p>Not necessarily.  The example bindings in the core spec might only contain 3 or 4 codes.  The bindings needed in an IG might not overlap at all with those - so you may well create IG-specific codes</p>

We reserve the right to improve upon this with a more nuanced approach in the future.
