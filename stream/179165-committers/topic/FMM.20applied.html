<p>My understanding was that the committees would do their QA check using the FMM and speadsheet. By registering their assessment and FMM in that spreadsheet; that their resource would get marked with that FMM. Yet a week later and the Resources are still at zero. Was this my misunderstanding? Or is there some process (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> ) that is yet to happen?</p>

<p>The spreadsheet is expected to be updated as of the end of this week.  The FMG will then review it, double-check against warnings in the build, etc.  At that point, the FMM levels will be propagated into the build for publication purposes</p>

<p>okay... I was seeing other resource FMM change, so I was wondering about the procedure.</p>

<p>You can edit the fhir.ini if you like, but whatever you put there will get overridden based on the FMG assessment of the spreadsheet in about a week's time.</p>

<p>thanks. It would be best if we all moved at the same time, using the same system. I am getting all kinds of feedback about current build showing FMM seemingly random values. Would be better if they were all stuck at 0 until FMG action.</p>

<p>next time round, I will ensure that both current and aspired levels are shown. Setting the levels to 0 conveys strong messages to implementers that are wrong</p>

<p>I agree... but everyone got thrown to zero, and I have left them at zero waiting for process to bring them back. Others clearly went ahead of process and self-promoted their desired FMM.</p>
