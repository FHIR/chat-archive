<p>The IHE profiles on FHIR are about to be published. We followed the copyright and trademark rules.. BUT it appears that we should not ever spell out the FHIR acronym? Is that true?   This is what the leadership at IHE reads from the following explaination   "Per the HL7 website “Please refer to the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources as the "HL7® FHIR® standard". When referencing the FHIR® standard in a web site, document, presentation, or otherwise, please in a place of prominence refer to it as the "HL7® FHIR® standard". In subsequent uses, please refer to it as the "FHIR® standard" or "FHIR®"</p>

<p>I don't think you should never spell it out. just that "FHIR" is the formal name</p>

<p>ah, that is good clarification. so somewhere in descriptive text on should spell it out. But elsewhere it is just FHIR. So the one specific where IHE did spell it out was the formal identification of FHIR as the standard being profiled. Given this is formal reference, then no spelling it out. This is counter to normal, but understandable.</p>
