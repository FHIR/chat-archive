<p>Let's rephrase. When will US Core be committed to gForge so that C-CDA on FHIR (which depends on DAF) can run a clean build. Do we get an extension on the Dec 4 deadline if US Core is not committed by then? </p>

<p>Brett, if you don't see a problem, try syncing and running the C-CDA on FHIR IG to see what I mean. </p>

<p>Ok, then if we are all in agreement that a clean C-CDA on FHIR build is waiting for the Grahame-stock love-in until everything works in harmony, then we are good. </p>

<p><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core</a> is the permanent home for us-core content it will resolve to that.    Why do you need a "clean us-core build"?   All I thought you needed was the definition.zip file ( see above) and the url.  do you need something else?  Besides you can get the source from here  <a href="https://github.com/Healthedata1/US-Core" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/Healthedata1/US-Core">https://github.com/Healthedata1/US-Core</a>  and build it with the IG publisher.   When is complete we will copy it to SVN.  </p>

<p>Sarah, I suggest you and I stop, stating that we believe everything to be content correct. Anything remaining should be ballot QA. Grahame will let us know if there is more work to be done. </p>
