<p>I think my understanding of the cardinality of extensions has been muddled.    When creating an element in a profile whose type is extension, how do we define how many times the extension can be used?  For example the extensions is defined as  0..*  and  I want to say in my profile you can have up to 5 repeats  - do I make the element 0..5?  If the extension is defined as 1..1 and I wan't 5 repeats in the profile - I'm hosed because that message is invalid or should be any way  So in short the extension define what is permitted and you need to conform to that in the profile referencing the extension.</p>

<p>If the extension is defined as 1..1, then if your profile references the extension, the cardinality must be 1..1.  (So extensions shouldn't be defined with tighter cardinality than could theoretically be useful.)</p>
