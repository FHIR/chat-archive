<p>@CDS people (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span>) - we are hoping to use PlanDefinition and ActivityDefinition to record a drug manufacturing protocol (a batch formula - a recipe basically).</p>
<p>Most of what we need is there but it would be really useful if ActivityDefinition.product[x] could be a Reference(Ingredient) as well as a Medication and Substance as it is now.</p>
<p>Also the subject of the whole PlanDefinition would be a particular type of product, that is being manufactured by this protocol. We would like PlanDefinition.subject to allow a reference to a MedicinalProductDefinition.</p>
<p>Are these feasible changes please?</p>

<p>Why not doing that in the medication definitional resources as an element? Basically saying "this is the product, and here goes the formula".<br>
I'm thinking of magistral / officinal preparations, not sure if that is your use case. <br>
I can't be precise on why  PlanDefinition  seems off, but I think it's because it puts emphasis on the set of actions and workflow - for making a drug you are not really defining the workflow, in "decomposable actions" but just a set of instructions.</p>

<p>There are other groups that are already using PlanDefinition in this same way, and it seems like a good fit if you are trying to describe what happens in more detail. I'm certainly no expert in this area though, but the proposed changes sound reasonable to me <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191651">@Rik Smithies</span> , submit some trackers?</p>

<p>Thanks Bryn, will do that. If you can point me at others doing the same that would be great</p>
