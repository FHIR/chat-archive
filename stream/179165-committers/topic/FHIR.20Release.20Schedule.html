<p>Hi all, yesterday during the FHIR-I WG call <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194452">@Bas van den Heuvel</span> brought up the question of releases, specifically in the context of R5.  To facilitate discussion, I started writing up some thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>However, in doing some background reading I have a couple of questions about the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/versions.html">FHIR Versions</a> page.  Specifically, the page is Normative and states several times that FHIR releases <em>will</em> happen every 18-24 months.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask about this before going further, since I'm not sure what to make of it.  To be blunt, I don't think it should've been in that page (at least written the way it is), but since it's describing the release process and is normative, I also think that it probably has some meaning.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>yeah that shouldn't be normative.</p>

<p>It's not conformance verbiage.  It doesn't say SHALL.  So I wouldn't worry about it too much.  That said, a change proposal to soften the language going forward isn't a bad idea.</p>
