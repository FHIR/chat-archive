<p>If you are the developer of a FHIR IG that is being balloted in the January 2021 Ballot cycle, you should have received an email from me on 2020-11-26 with information related to the QA status of your IG as well as any outstanding request for information.  The QA period FHIR IGs for this ballot cycle is now open and unless you have received approval from the sponsoring Work Group for a shortened QA period, your IG should have been delivered to the WG.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  If you are the develop for a FHIR IG in this cycle and did not receive an email from me, please let me know!  Thank you.</p>
