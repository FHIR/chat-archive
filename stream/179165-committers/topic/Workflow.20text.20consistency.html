<p>Now that Patient Care has aligned our resources with workflow patterns, I need to delete out the existing blurb about a "planned change" to align with workflow, but I started to question whether I should replace it with a statement saying we have aligned with workflow.  I poked around a few other resources and saw different approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some resources make no mention of workflow (even though they are listed as workflow resources)</li>
<li>Some resources have their first sentence in the "Scope and Usage" section stating something like "This resource is an event resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see Workflow."</li>
<li>Some resources have a sentence buried later on in the "Scope and Usage" section that says something similar "resource is a "request" resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see Workflow Request"</li>
</ul>
<p>Thoughts on whether we should all try to be consistent with either including/excluding text?  If included, preferences on where the blurb should reside and what it should say?</p>

<p>Certainly it should be mentioned in the Scope &amp; Usage section with a link to the Workflow page, but I'm not terribly fussed about whether it's the first thing listed</p>

<p>OK -- I'll see if PC WG has a preference, but I will plan to use text similar to what I saw with Observation and MedicationRequest.</p>
