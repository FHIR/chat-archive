<p>I am not sure of the best place to report this. I have the Davinci-epdx IG using Sushi/fsh. I have tried building a capability statement in fsh. Sushi successfully creates all the input, although it takes an extended period of time. However, if I then build the IG, because there is a fish directory the publisher runs sushi but effectively errors with a 143 error. I think the publisher is timing out and giving up after about a minute. <br>
There are two workarounds. 1. Change the fsh folder to another name so that the publisher doesn't try to run sushi.  or 2. run sushi then change the capability statement.fsh file to another name e.g. add .ignore. Then the publisher runs sushi but doesn't choke on the capability statement but the previously generated capability files are there in the input folder for incorporation into the IG.</p>

<p>If you know the sushi-generated content is up to date, you can run the publisher with the <code>-no-sushi</code> flag to skip regenerating that content. That should help a bit. (It won't help with the auto-build though.)</p>

<p>alternatively, you can use fsh.ini to tell the IG publisher to wait longer for sushi to complete</p>
