<p>Is there a way to signup for monitoring gForge other than: One-at-a-time, or All-of-FHIR. I would like to filter items on a topic, and ask for monitoring of all of them. I tried using the checkbox, but don't see a monitor ability. The monitor control in the left column seems to be all or nothing.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> Not built in.  I have a hack that's supposed to email you things "of interest" once a week, but I had to re-set up my Amazon instance because I lost the certificate for my old one and need to re-figure out how to set up email access (and ideally do it this time in a way that doesn't generally route to people's spam folders).  You can edit FHIR/Tracker/interestedParties.xml to indicate what you're interested in as an individual.  Once I get email working again, you'll get them.</p>

<p>And of course, if/when we migrate from gForge, it might not need to be a hack anymore.</p>

<p>okay. I really just wanted to make sure it wasn't something I was missing. I can live without it. It would be nice to be able to subscribe to updates on a workgroup basis, or Resource basis... thanks </p>

<p>Well, for the work group items, there'll be an email coming out to co-chairs that lists what each work group is interested in, so you can see that there.</p>
