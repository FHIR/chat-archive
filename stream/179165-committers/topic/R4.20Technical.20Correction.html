<p><a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-26435">J#26435</a>  was logged as a R4 tech correction, but it's just a definition clarification, which in my opinion, doesn't rise to the level of a technical correction.  Assuming that is correct, what is the correct process to change the JIRA?  Does the submitter (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192166">@Jean Duteau</span> ) need to make that change?  Can a work group change this (I assume I have to re-open it in order to change it)?</p>

<p>Technical correction means spelling, grammar, formatting, tooling or similar issue.  They are always "corrections" where the fix is obvious.  A 'clarification' should never be categorized as a technical correction.  You should re-categorize (using 'Move') to 'Change Request'.</p>
