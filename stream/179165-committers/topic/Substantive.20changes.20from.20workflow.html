These changes were approved by workflow some time ago.  The first is most critical - changing 'context' to 'encounter' to ensure consistency with Observation for a rather important element.  The second change of adding the notion of 'reported' would still be good but isn't as critical.  Note that the first may also involve tweaking search parameters.  Substantive changes are supposed to be complete by EOD on Nov. 1.  If you don't have a call before then but feel the change will be non-controversial within your workgroup, feel free to pre-apply.</p>

<p>I don't like the name "reported[x]" since that overlaps with whether the item has been reported on.<br>
Also, how do we record Encounter for a resource which could be created as part of multiple events. Specifically, if a patient visits the department twice for the same imaging study or lab order (imaging with and without contrast; blood panel fasting and not fasting, etc.). Should encounter be 0..*?</p>

<p>The encounter for a lab order is generally the encounter it's created in, not the encounters used to fulfill it.  If reported[x] doesn't work for your work group, you can use something different.  (It won't get in for Observation this round anyhow - and that's probably where it would be most problematic.)</p>

<p>Actually, the reported[x] concept is weird for ImagingStudy. What does it mean? "I told you I had images done, but you don't have records for them"? "Here are images done elsewhere, so we should flag them as hearsay imaging"?</p>

<p>Totally fine if that's not core (or even an extension) for ImagingStudy.  Essentially you need to answer the question of how would existing systems deal with a patient saying "I had an X-Ray done over at such-and-such a hospital last week".  If they'd create an ImagingStudy instance, then you need 'reported'.  If they'd capture it as a note or just nod their head and say "that's nice" without recording anything, no need for the element.</p>

<p>ImagingStudy aside, I'd like the "reported" element renamed to something less likely to conflict with other uses of "report" (like, this X has been reported on). If this change is for any normative resources, we need to discuss now, otherwise it can wait.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for the change is that you might want to tie a record to both an Encounter and multiple episodes of care.  Right now, that's not possible.  With the change, you can.</p>

<p>If they really feel that linking to episodeOfCare is core for some of their resources (i.e. most systems currently support that), they could add a core element for that too.</p>

<p>For Med statement, you might have a code that differentiated "reported" vs. "inferred" statements.  For Observation, probably outside the 80%, but I can see "reported" being used to distinguish direct device/clinician measurements from deferred patient reporting (e.g. when patient is on holiday or leave of absense).  For procedure, it'd be the difference between recording a surgery, councelling, etc. based on clinical knowledge of occurrence vs. patient or care provider reporting "this happened".</p>

<p>@Eric - it depends on the context of the observation.  If it's a white blood cell count, almost certainly.  If it's weight and the patient has a dedicated device that auto-reports into their iPhone app, not necessarily.</p>
