<p>I recall a discussion about the continuous build not working when the branch name in a pull-request included the '/'... I recall we figured it was a one-off... but I just discovered another committer that used a branch name with a '/' in it. <br>
Not sure what we can do about this, but two instances does show it was slightly less than a one-off.</p>
