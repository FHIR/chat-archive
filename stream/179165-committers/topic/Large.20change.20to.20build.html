<p>I'm just committing a rather large change to the spec. This is not a good time to be doing that, but any other time is worse :-(. This change changes ElementDefinition.type so that instead of repeating .type for each combination of type/profile or type/targetProfile, we now have one type, and repeat profile or targetProfile. </p>
<p>This turned out to cause 100s of changes in the code, and the process of updating was overwhelming for this stage in the process. What I can say is the spec builds. But I would be completely unsurprised to find rendering problems in any of the following places:<br>
- the tree view of resources or profiles<br>
- xml and json templates<br>
- the UML view<br>
If there are problems, it will be in the presentation of types for a choice[x] element, or in the allowed targets for a reference</p>
<p>I'll be doing QA, but the point of this message is to alert you all to not take the correctness of these views for granted right now - check them. </p>
<p>Also, sadly, I have no idea whether any IGs build correctly. I simply don't have time to check this right now</p>

<p>Brave. It's going to be a bit painful for us, but certainly not 100s of places, luckily.</p>
