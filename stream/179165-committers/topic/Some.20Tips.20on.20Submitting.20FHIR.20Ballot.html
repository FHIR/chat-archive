<p>This morning I got several emails entitled "Some Tips on Submitting FHIR Ballot". In the message, it is requested we submit comments directly to gForge. OK, happy to do that. However, if we submit directly to gForge, should we also submit the old fashioned spreadsheet? My guess is "no" but I want to make sure. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Yes, if you submit your comment through Gforge, you still need to submit the spreadsheet in order to your vote and type.  As per the tips document, you must complete Column K - Vote and Type and Column M - Tracker # and if your vote is NEG or A-S, you must complete Column L in the spreadsheet.</p>
