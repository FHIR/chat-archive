<p>A note to profile developers: My most recent commit is going to cause the IGPublisher process to yell if your differential contains element paths that don't/can't exist in the undrelying resource.  So it's going to expect that you use value[x] vs. value[foo] appropriately, it'll catch misnamed elements, etc. that the prior process would have missed.  So it may be a good idea to check your build with the new process sooner rather than later to avoid surprises.  (All of the things it complains about would have meant invalid snapshots and thus invalid validation and publication in the past, so it's not changing the rules, just identifying problems it used to miss.)</p>

<p>what exactly was being missed?</p>

<p>If elements were present with the wrong path name (e.g. <a href="http://Observation.name" target="_blank" title="http://Observation.name">Observation.name</a> in a profile on Patient) or names that were wrong or elements that didn't exist anymore, they'd simply be ignored.  Also, there are times when the snapshot will name an element something like valueIdentifier and other times value[x] based on what the constraints on the type are.  If the name in the differential didn't match, it wouldn't flag a problem.  (But hyperlinks in the generated spec wouldn't work.)</p>
