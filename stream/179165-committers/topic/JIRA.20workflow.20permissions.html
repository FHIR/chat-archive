<p>I cannot move JIRA FHIR tickets through the workflow. I click "Change Applied" on, for example, <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-24270" target="_blank" title="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-24270">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-24270</a>, and I get the message:</p>
<p>Change Category is required when IssueType is ChangeProposal and Resolution is Persuasive, Persuasive w/ Mod or Not Persuasive w/ Mod<br>
It seems that you have tried to perform an illegal workflow operation.<br>
If you think this message is wrong, please contact your Jira administrators.</p>

<p>You may need to re-open it and fill in the change category, then move it through to applied.  I thought I had filled all of the change categories in before importing to Jira, but evidently not :(</p>

<p>I clicked "re-open" so now the ticket is status "triaged", but I don't see anything that looks like "change category." Is that the correct status to see "change category"? Or maybe I don't have the correct permissions?</p>
<p>As a possibly-related aside, I can hit "e" on my keyboard to edit the issue when I have it selected as part of an issue search, but I can't edit it at all when I am looking directly at the issue.</p>

<p>Click on "Propose Disposition" or any of the other disposition workflows and you should be able to set a field named "Change Category".</p>

<p>Yes, thank you Lloyd. I didn't want to keep pushing the ticket around the workflow hoping to find the right place, so thank you for the info.</p>
