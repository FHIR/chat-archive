<p>I just noticed now (and its been there a while :-/) that there are xml and json views of profiles in the build.  While I appreciate the effort, as they render now they're incomplete and I think confusing when inspecting thing like slicing and patterns and looking at choices.  I would prefer them not to present and stick to the diff and snapshot tree views only.</p>
<p>for example: vitals panel json view doesn't show slicing values:  file:///Users/ehaas/Documents/FHIR/working-build/publish/vitalspanel.html</p>
<p>looking for trackers related to this but didn't see any.</p>
