<p>Some resources such as Practitioner don't seem to have entered in error value in their spreadsheet, and yet this is not flagged as a warning (or at least, it doesn't stop it being FMM 3). The medication definition resources don't not need this (deleting one would not be clinically significant), so how can I I work around this warning?</p>

<p>I'm not sure where it's specified, but it is specified somewhere</p>

<p>anyhow, you should just create an entered-in-error-status and write what you want to say.</p>

<p>but "deleting one would not be clinically significant" doesn't mean "don't not need this" - the question still arises: what would you do if you had created one in error?</p>

<p>Probably just delete it again. </p>
<p>There is no need that I know of to preserve these things to say "this was once what we believed". I suppose one would have see if anyone had used this information consequentially, but that seems really beyond FHIR. </p>
<p>I can create dummy "entered in errors" to work around this. I can say ".status=entered-in-error" - which works nicely even if there is no status attribute ;-). But maybe I can just put free text in there, that did not occur to me.</p>

<p>just explain to the users so that they know what to expect</p>
