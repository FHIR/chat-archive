<p>Follow-up to Workflow discussion this week. Are there any concerns if Workflow renames Cancelled and Suspended values in the Request.status value set. The proposed name changes would be: <br>
 'Revoked' would be used instead of 'Cancelled'. Rationale for change: Revoked is generic and does not distinguish between whether the Order was actually started. In some systems it is important to just state the order is not to be carried out and it doesn't matter ( or is unknown) whether the order has started. </p>
<p>1.Another issue to be discussed separately is that in other systems it is important to distinguish between Cancelled e.g. with my Pharmacy hat on, the use of cancelled would mean the order is cancelled prior to any administrations occurring; and Stopped e.g. with my Pharmacy hat on, the use of stopped would mean the order is stopped at some time after 'some' administrations have occurred. </p>
<p>2.On-Hold would be used instead of Suspended</p>
<p>1.Rationale for change: On-Hold is the more common name in use. </p>
<p>1.Are there any concerns if Workflow renames Aborted and Suspended in the Event.status value set. The proposed name changes would be: </p>
<p>1.Stopped would be used instead of Aborted</p>
<p>1.Rationale for change: Stopped is more commonly used. </p>
<p>2.On-Hold would be used instead of Suspended</p>
