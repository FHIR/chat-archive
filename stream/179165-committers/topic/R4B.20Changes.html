<p>Just double-checking, changes from reconciliation for R4B ballot comments can be applied to the R4B branch, yes?</p>

<p>To provide some context:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shortly after the due date for R4B freeze the Citation Resource had a near-complete restructuring as CDS WG revisited the Resource Proposal and triggered the message to send the Resource Proposal to FMG.</li>
<li>There is an R4B Ballot comment (<a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-31865">FHIR-31865</a>) created 2021-04-13 to not have Citation in FHIR. The FMG provisionally approved Citation Resource proposal on 2021-04-14 with the discussion noting addition to description to distinguish use from Provenance Resource. Comments in <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-31865">FHIR-31865</a> notes this change in <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-31973">FHIR-31973</a> which was applied to R5 and the phrasing aligns with Citation Resource structure in R5.  The R4B Ballot comment <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-31865">FHIR-31865</a> was resolved as Not Persuasive with Modification on 2021-05-05.</li>
<li>Another R4B Ballot comment (<a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-31643">FHIR-31643</a>) seeks an example for the Citation Resource.  There are no comments yet and that ballot tracker could be used to propose the following concepts as a proposed disposition.</li>
<li>There is no expectation from any group to use or develop the current R4B version  of the Citation Resource and there is substantial use and development of the current  R5 version of the Citation Resource.  There is no interest in creating an example for the R4B version that will not be used, and we have hundreds of examples that could be added for the R5 version.</li>
<li>SOA WG for the FAIR4FHIR project voted at the WGM to seek an IG using R4B but would like to use the R5 version of Citation rather than the R4B version in this IG. We agreed in the SOA meeting to bring this issue to CDS and FMG to see what we could do.  CDS has not met on this yet as there have not been meetings since the WGM.</li>
<li>For the EBM community that is new to using FHIR Resources for new spaces (Citation, Evidence, EvidenceReport, EvidenceVariable) where the R4B version of Citation is neither used nor supported (and is at maturity level 0), it would be much better to remove it than have it out there to cause confusion and non-interoperable system developments</li>
<li>With all these considerations the proposed resolution in order of preference could be:<br>
a. Replace the R4B version of Citation with the R5 version of Citation and document whatever is necessary for explanation in the "Trial Use Note" so the change is explicit and compliant with any ANSI or other expectations.  It may not be the balloted version but let it be stated explicitly and the change is part of response to balloted comments.<br>
b. Replace the R4B version of Citation with a note to direct people to the R5 version of Citation and not have an R4B version of Citation.<br>
c. Place a note at the top of the R4B version of Citation stating it will not be maintained or supported and users should consider the R5 version of Citation to use the resource.  Citation is not really supported in R4.<br>
d. Keep it in R4B but add a note that examples and refinements will only be applied if implementers identify that they are using it, aware of the issues above, and have specific reason to use it in R4.</li>
</ol>

<p>Process-wise, you're allowed to make substantive (and even breaking) changes as part of ballot resolution, but there's an expectation that what's published is largely consistent with what went to ballot.  If you're making radical changes, then the expectation is that you go back to ballot.</p>

<p>Obviously going back to ballot here is going to create some angst within the BR&amp;R group as the whole point of R4B was to have a 'quicker' release than they could achieve with R5.  In theory you could get in an NIB for Sept. ballot cycle and get this out and reviewed again, but we don't have a way to publish an R4 release.  However, we might be able to make an exception and just send people to some sort of frozen snapshot of the CI build if you promise to not make changes to that page for the duration of the ballot?  (Reality is we can't put out formal publication of R4B until end of Sept. anyhow, so a ballot in August might not delay publication.)  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> - thoughts?</p>

<p>I think it's possible we could get another ballot for R4B out while I'm on the road - that's a much lower mountain to climb than a full release for many reasons</p>

<p>I certainly would rather avoid balloting again though. BR&amp;R &amp; TSC have to decide what's 'radical changes' but I think that on the whole the processes we have exist to stop committees doing this kind of thing</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  I fully share your concerns in term of process and deadlines. <br>
I was however also wondering what should be the changes that would require a new ballot for a draft resource (FMM 0). <br>
I don't see here - for example - any change in scope, but  a better way to address the business requirements that have been identified during this period. <br>
I was also wondering  if in general it is worth to publish a version that might be somehow used by stakeholders or a thing that born dead. (without creating burden and delays in the publication)</p>

<p>There's no point publishing something born dead.  Definitely not asking for that.  Just saying that if there's a complete revamp of a resource between what was commented on at ballot and what is eventually published, we can't legitimately call the published thing as 'balloted as STU'.</p>

<p>I see three possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>determination made that the changes aren't sufficiently radical to invalidate the ballot review that's happened; proceed to publish as STU</li>
<li>determination made that the changes <em>are</em> sufficiently radical<br>
-- go back to ballot, then publish as STU<br>
-- don't go back to ballot, publish as draft, and go STU in R5</li>

<p>The Citation Resource in R4B is not valid to be presented as a standard for trial use. The issue is a desire by FAIR4FHIR project to create an IG where there is a desire to use R4 for the IG to allow an earlier IG but also a desire to use the R5 version of Citation.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> So we can now replace the R4B Citation content with the R5 Citation content, and FAIR4FHIR can use it in descriptive terms with no impact if they do not profile it. Does this need approval by FMG or TSC, or is this sufficient for us to make the changes?</p>

<p>If you're comfortable dropping the status of the artifact from STU to draft, you're fine to make the change.  If you wanted to keep it as STU, FMG might need to evaluate how substantive the changes were.</p>
