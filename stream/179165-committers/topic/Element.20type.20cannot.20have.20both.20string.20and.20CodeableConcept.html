<p>How do I override this error?<br>
<code>Element type cannot have both string and CodeableConcept unless the difference between their usage is explained in the comments</code><br>
I'm trying to apply <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-26424">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-26424</a><br>
and I believe this is the rationale<br>
"The string is used for properties that are intrinsically text, such as warning text, or assembly instructions. CodeableConcept.text also supports unencoded text but should be used where the characteristic is a concept that might be coded but there is no assigned code for the present value. For example, a security class can be a code like 'Class 1' but in some cases may contain a string like 'Depending on the settings' - in this case the property is normally coded but this is an exception."</p>

<p>Do you have comments for the element that provide that explanation?</p>

<p>thanks. I had created an element and left it almost empty and put all the explanation in the definition. Now I moved it to the comment and it works</p>
