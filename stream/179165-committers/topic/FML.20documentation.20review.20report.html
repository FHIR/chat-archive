<p>What's the best way to feed back a documentation review? As part of the Connectathon FML track we have reviewed the FHIR documentation. We have a lot of suggestions: typos, minor corrections, some rewording for clarity, one or two new sections, and some questions . Ideally we don't want one Jira for each. But also just editing it all and committing is not ok I expect. I have a Word copy of it with tracked changes.</p>
