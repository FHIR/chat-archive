<p>BR&amp;R has a UML model that has workflow semantics including activity composition, optionality,  and contingency. This is used for in clinical research for what is sometimes called a study's "schedule of activities". Generally speaking, it seems like the FHIR workflow structures cover these semantics. Is this accurate? Thx.</p>

<p>I think this would be PlanDefinition.  That's the resource we use to describe what set of activities are possible, what order they should happen in, what dependencies the have, etc.  From a workflow perspective, this fits into the Definition pattern - what actions can occur.  You'd then take the PlanDefinition and turn it into a research subject-specific "CarePlan" instance once they'd been randomized and you knew what you actually wanted to do with that particular patient.  There might still be some optionality and contingency there, but there'd be a lot less and a lot of the timings would start to be nailed down.</p>
