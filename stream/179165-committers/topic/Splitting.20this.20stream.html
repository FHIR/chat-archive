<p>It's been pointed out by an "infrequent" committer that our expectation to activeliy monitor this stream is a bit much for some to manage.  (It's not uncommon to have 100+ posts a day, though most of those are posted by bots.  Our real intention with the "if you want committer privileges, you must monitor this stream" is:<br>
1. check to make sure you didn't break the build<br>
2. ensure you're up-to-date with any important announcements about tool changes, commit rule changes, freezes, deadlines, etc.</p>
<p>For #1, you only need to actively monitor during the time-period you're doing commits.  #2 could be moved to a separate "committer announcements" stream which would be lower traffic (probably &lt;5 messages/week on average).  The main stream would be used for things like "tx server is down" or "I have this bug" and similar discussions as well as the standard bot-notification streams. </p>
<p>Thoughts/opinions on making such a split?</p>

<p>Ignoring the bots is easy, zulip allows you to grab a stream and mark all read.  The hard to catch are the inspiration found within a discussion about how to unbreak the build. No idea how to capture those unless those participating can summarize their ah-ha moment onto a dedicated thread for those.</p>

<p>There's still 20-30 comments a day that aren't bot-generated and 95%+ of that is not useful to people who aren't actively committing.  There are absolutely situations where a problem that someone had isn't relevent to you but becomes relevent to you when you run into the same problem 3 months later, but I'm not sure that's sufficient justification to tell people they must read all of the discussion - because the reality is they won't, and when they "mark read" they miss the important announcements too.</p>

<p>We can shut down discussions happening in the bot threads if we decide that's problematic.  I think the first question we need to answer is "what are our expectations for non-frequent committers in terms of actually reading content - what do they HAVE to read?"  The second question is "How do we make it easy for them to read that without having to read everything else?"</p>

<p>I think reviewing the thread for information that might be useful is okay, if I can find it of course, but it does not replace the need for some resource that committers should be familiar with and thoroughly read prior to committing. This thread is long and chances that I will find all I need to properly commit are slim especially when working on tight timelines. However, reading a set of guidelines, rules, best practices and regularly reviewing such a document, would not be onerous for a sporadic committer like me.</p>

<p>Seems to be a balance of opinions in favor and against.  I don't really understand the issue with splitting the stream - for those who want to monitor everything, it doesn't change the amount of effort and it's no harder to track the same content split to multiple places.  We'll have to police to make sure "important" stuff is on the key-info stream and general debate/discussion is on the other.  If you want to influence what happens, you need to be on both.  If you just want to know the rules, you can just be on the low traffic one.</p>

<p>OK. I heard "read-only" as less literal than you did (especially since Zulip doesn't have a concept like that). I heard it as "a place where most of the posting is from automated bots".</p>

<p>That won't fix the issue.  We need to split the discussion part from the rules part.  The non-frequent committers don't want to wade through 600 posts of discussion about how the build works and various build errors to glean the few tidbits of "rules you must follow" or "hints you should know".  Frequent committers will care about the bot stuff and discussion stuff in equal measure.</p>

<p>My preference is the following: Add a new committers-annouce stream.  Sign up every person who has committer access to the main build or to an IG to that stream with an expectation that all committers SHALL keep up and read every post - perhaps by turning on notifications.  It will be used <em>only</em> for high-priority notifications around freezes, tooling and similar issues.  Require that discussion about such posts occur on the regular committers thread.  Keep the committers list as it stands with all bot notifications and commentary discussion and allow discussion to happen within what topics the users wish.  I.e. ig-build remains right where it is.</p>
