<p>I found that a number of coding system OIDs are being repurposed between releases and builds.  Per <a href="#narrow/stream/implementers/topic/OIDs" title="#narrow/stream/implementers/topic/OIDs">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/implementers/topic/OIDs</a>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> said that bindings.ini should prevent that from happening.  Today, after a local build that introduced new value set bindings, I committed bindings.ini, which looks like it had 60+ new bindings auto generated from my local build that were not previously committed.  That leads me to believe that we (committers) are not checking in bindings.ini like we should when a new binding is created.  I wonder if that is the root of the issue behind why OIDs are getting re-assigned between builds and published versions of the spec.</p>

<p>this is strange. you should not get updates to bindings.ini unless the build tool is told that it's doing a final build for <a href="http://hl7.org" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org">hl7.org</a>. That's why you don't usually get changes in bindings.ini - I would get them at publication time</p>

<p>I will investigate</p>

<p>For whatever it is worth, I did a full local build using -nopartial</p>
