<p>A few questions about Backbone Elements:<br>
-   Is a Backbone Element an element in a resource that is a grouping of meaningfully-related sub-elements? (I see the definition for Backbone Element in the spec: “The base definition for elements defined as part of a resource definition”. There seems to be a bit more to it than the definition describes).<br>
-   Rules for deciding if an element should be a Backbone Element or a Resource: Is it correct to say that a set of info would be a Backbone Element vs a Resource if the set of info isn’t able to exist on its own without further contextual info?<br>
-   Is it correct to say that in converting UML classes to FHIR resources, that a class would be represented in FHIR as a backbone element if that class has a composition relationship to the “owning class” or has a 1…1 or 1..* relationship with the “owning class”?<br>
-   Is there any additional doc available about Backbone Elements other than what is published in the spec?<br>
Thanks for any help in clarifying.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192947">@Julie Evans</span> There's information on the characteristics that resources need to have documented here: <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Resource_Considerations#Resources" target="_blank" title="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Resource_Considerations#Resources">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Resource_Considerations#Resources</a>.  In general, yes - BackboneElements are UML composition, while Reference is used for aggregation relationships</p>
