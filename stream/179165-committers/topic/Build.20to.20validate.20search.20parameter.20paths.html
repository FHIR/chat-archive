<p>It seems that the build doesn't validate that search expression paths are valid. This would be a good addition, particularly because it is not easy to notice mistakes.  </p>
<p>They don't cause examples to fail etc, so you may not know until you try them on a real server, months later at the earliest, and they don't work. It's a long compile cycle. (You can tell this has happened to me...)</p>
<p>Other errors are more easy to spot visually, but an invalid search parameter still appears in the HTML, just with a blank path. It has taken me a couple of years to notice this means the path is not valid (rather than too long to fit, as I thought).</p>
<p>It's easier than you think to make a mistake here because you can change the resource, e.g. add a backbone element, and break an existing search parameter path and never notice.</p>

<p>it certainly does validate them as well as I can. Please be specific</p>

<p>Ah sorry there, well I actually wondered if it might, but it seems to miss at least some. </p>
<p>Here:<br>
<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2020May/packagedproductdefinition.html#search">http://hl7.org/fhir/2020May/packagedproductdefinition.html#search</a><br>
there is no expression showing for "device" or  "manufactured-item". </p>
<p>It is now corrected, as of today when I fixed the path, for those two (and some additions, but that's not related):<br>
<a href="http://build.fhir.org/packagedproductdefinition.html#search">http://build.fhir.org/packagedproductdefinition.html#search</a></p>
<p>The path until yesterday was PackagedProductDefinition.containedItem.item, which doesn't exist. It never existed, total typo by me. </p>
<p>It is now fixed to be PackagedProductDefinition.<strong>package</strong>.containedItem.item. </p>
<p>There was also a case of this earlier where a search param was pathed to a backbone element, so was basically broken. The path was a valid path, just not one that I assume could ever be a valid search parameter. The backbone element and the missing leaf attribute had the same name, so at a glance it looked ok...</p>

<p>ok I'll investigate</p>
