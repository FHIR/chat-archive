<p>Is it acceptable to have the more protected codesystems in examples? For example the Imaging workgroup really wants to use RadLex in their example for procedure codes</p>

<p>I think that should be acceptable, John.  Procedure.code has an example binding to SNOMED CT, which also isn't freely available for everyone to use (and that's why bindings to SNOMED CT value sets, at least so far, are example).  And since the binding is example, anyone is free to use a different code system / value set if it's applicable, so I think it should be fine to include examples that show that.  That's my take.</p>

<p>Thank Rob. I know I can 'use' other code systems. I am specifically asking if FHIR publication/governance rules allow me to put a RadLex code into an example that is published in the core specification. I know there are some rules around use of copy protected codes, but I think they are specific to vocabulary bindings in the model. Thus examples can use any code system. Just wanted confirmation.</p>

<p>Well, we can see what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> also think about it.</p>

<p>Using a bare code probably isn't an issue.  Using a display name for it might.  So I'd stick with system, code and text -where the text is something other than the Radlex display name.  That should keep them from having any concerns about sharing their IP.</p>

<p>I guess I'm not sure why they would have more concern about the use of the display name than the code itself.  Either way, we need to be sure that we are staying in compliance with their IP rules.</p>

<p>Exposing a bare code doesn't share any of their IP - no one can use the code without a copy of their spec.  Sharing the code + display name does expose a (tiny) piece of their IP.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that's entirely correct, Lloyd.   But it doesn't really matter.  We (FHIR) just need to determine and follow whatever their license requires.</p>

<p>right. we have no rule against radlex codes in examples, or any other codes in examples, as long as there is no IP violation </p>
