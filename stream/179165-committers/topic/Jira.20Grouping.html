<p>Is it possible to change a Jira item "grouping" once the item is Applied. e.g. <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-26568" title="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-26568">FHIR#26568</a></p>

<p>Admins can, but not anyone else at the moment.  What's the use-case?  Is there anything else you think should be changeable by managers once applied?</p>

<p>Groupings - are just labels basically. I put a wrong one on accidentally and once the item is applied there is no way to get rid of it. I fixed it but had to go through hoops: re-open it, then do the resolution again, enter the vote again, then make it applied again. I suppose we don't want them changing by anyone at any time, but working with them is awkward currently, even before the item is Applied.</p>

<p>Anything else you think should be editable post-resolution?</p>

<p>I have also had to edit a resolution before, because I put the wrong person, then checked the minutes later. That is not easy, you have to revoke and repeat the whole thing. And its relatively important. Other things like the general text of the item you may want to edit, but they have less significance.</p>
