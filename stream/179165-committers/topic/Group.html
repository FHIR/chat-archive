<p>I was going to say that I don't know who added them.  However, looks like they've been there since it was first created, which means it was probably me...  Theory was that research or public health might care about collections of any of those, but as I think about it now, value sets of codes is a more reasonable matter to deal with that requirement.  I'd be fine with dropping them.</p>

<p>For the purposes of creating an inventory, would you use a Group or a List? (not that I have a particular use case in mind)</p>

<p>Group is generally for a collection that can be acted upon (e.g. be the subject of an Observation, Procedure, etc.).  That doesn't seem to be relevant for inventory items.  So my leaning would be either List or just having the inventory reflected in what instances exist on the server</p>
