<p>If MedicationRequest.reportedBoolean  = true, then it would imply that this Medication was reported by a third party and not the author-practitioner?  If so then in C-CDA in a medication supply order if the author is present then it automatically implies MedicationRequest.reportedBoolean ='false'. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>I'm not sure that's necessarily true.  A patient could, in principle, report a prescription and indicate that it was prescribed by Dr. Smith.  I believe CDA allows a 'reporter' participation which, if present, and other than the author would correspond to reported=true.  I'm not sure you can necessarily always know that the absence of a reporter in CDA means "reportedBoolean=false".  However, I think you'd typically make that assumption.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> ...thank you for the quick response. I guess you were referring to the base model CDA specs. My apologies for not quoting the exact CDA spec I was refering to. I am referring to the CDA R2.1 (US Realm) -where they have a constrained set of elements specified and the reporter is not present in it. However, another point that came to my mind is that -What-if the author is NOT a provider. Hence , it would be essential to constrain the rule to be  such that <a href="http://Author.id">Author.id</a> SHALL be a provider identifier like NPI (National Provider Identifier - as used in US)</p>
