<p>Is there a mapping document from EHR (ERD model)-to-FHIR_mappings with ERD relationships transformed to FHIR Resource elements and maintain all the FHIR multiplicity / cardinality? Is there a spreadsheet of all FHIR 4.0 data elements?</p>

<p>Every EHR is different, so there can't be a generic mapping document.  And some resources may map to numerous different EHR constructs (e.g. Lab which covers vitals, lab, clinical assessments, nursing data and a bunch of other stuff.  Every EHR vendor thus has to do their own mappings (and continue to evolve those as FHIR evolves and/or as additional implementation guides are developed that refine what data is expected to appear where).</p>
<p>We don't generate an Excel spreadsheet that covers all the resources (or any of them, actually), but it would be pretty straightforward to take the profiles-structures.xml Bundle and write a small transform that would spit out a CSV you could use as a basis for such a spreadsheet.  If you wanted to you could use the profiles-types.xml as well to expand the different complex data types.</p>

<p>I guess the question arises, even though not all "resources" may map to the current EHR constructs and vice versa which leads to creation of a FHIR server repository that may not have a 100% match to FHIR specifications (resources, profiles, data types, etc.). Does that still get  us to be FHIR CONFORMANT (at least BASE FHIR SPECIFICATION)?</p>

<p>Yes - EHRs can be FHIR conformant even if they don't have the same capabilities or don't necessarily expose their data in exactly the same way.  FHIR IGs may impose additional expectations - such that an EHR might be FHIR-conformant but not conformant with something like the FHIR US-Core implementation guide.</p>

<p>Thank you Lloyd. That makes sense.  In other words, in addition to EHR, I may have 100's of healthcare analytics running based on user defined metrics derived from several EHR data sources (non-FHIR standards) by mapping those EHR data source elements that is  found to be a match with FHIR R4 resources and profiles, etc.). EHR elements that no match found in FHIR, is followed by creating FHIR extension, and they can still be FHIR Compliant (conformant). I am assuming that is correct? Finally,  who (person(s)) or what FHIR committee's or FHIR council's  we need to go through to get the FHIR conformant statement of interoperability? Is there an FHIR email address or contacts for the FHIR compliance folks? How do we as a company can PUBLISH A FHIR CAPABILITY STATEMENT?</p>

<p>Anyone can publish a FHIR capability statement.  There's no vetting or certification process through HL7.  A few organizations have certification processes for adherence to certain IGs (e.g. IHE), but by and large, the onus for verifying adherence to declarations of FHIR conformance fall on those who want to use the system.</p>

<p>No storage technology requirement - there are production systems using a wide variety of approaches.  In terms of API, the general recommendation is that servers should support all of the syntaxes (ideally even including RDF) as that maximizes the number of client systems that can talk to you.  The reference implementations provide syntax conversion, so there's rarely a good reason to constrain what syntaxes you permit.</p>

<p>Hi Lloyd, what FHIR resource can be mapped to Adjudicated Pharmacy Claim and Pharmacy Benefit Management? I am assuming MedicationAdministration, and Medication Request. Is that correct? Can we map the Claim Identifier to Pharmacy ID/NCPDP Provider ID/Pharmacy NPI? Do we capture claim adjustment in FHIR Resource ClaimResponse? For Dispense as Written (DAW), can we use FHIR Resource MedicationRequest.dispenseRequest? Please let me know, at your earliest convenience. Thank you.</p>

<p>The claim would be Claim and the adjudicated result would be ClaimResponse.  Both would point to MedicationRequest and/or MedicationDispense.  (they could point to MedicationAdministration for something like Methadone where you actually charge for the administration in addition to the dispense).  Can you explain Pharmacy Benefit Management?  If it's an explanation of benefit, then look at the ExplainationOfBenefit resource.</p>

<p>Thank you Lloyd. PBM, google definition is a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) is a third-party administrator of prescription drug programs for commercial health plans, self-insured employer plans, Medicare Part D plans, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and state government employee plans.  Express Scripts is an example of a PBM. Another PBM is CVS Caremark, the PBM of CVS Health. OptumRx is another example of PBM.</p>

<p>I do agree that the definition could use some work to make it more clear that it's "who should process the claim", not necessarily "who is the holder of the insurance contract".  Feel free to submit a change request to get this clarification made (and perhaps to explicitly reference "benefits manager" as a possible allowed value.</p>

<p>Hi Lloyd, could you please provide some clarity on the "ATTRIBUTION" table that is critical. Not able to  reference and match FHIR resources like Practitioner, Encounter, Claim, CarePlan, etc. to ATTRIBUTION columns. Would you recommend, submitting a Request for adding a ATTRIBUTION FHIR Resource. Also, there are several gaps in FHIR for Pharmacy Claim and Attachment? Could please provide suggestions and/or options for corresponding FHIR mappings?</p>

Date of most recent fill is determined by looking at what MedicationDispenses you have.  How is it being used on the claim?<br>

InsurancePlan isn't linked to any compartments - why would it need to be?  Generally the Patient coverage would link to the plan.  The plan is non-patient-specific.</p>

<p>Hi Lloyd, assuming we won't have a timely response from Paul. How do we address non-FHIR resource elements ( EHR Attribution Columns)  on an FHIR server? Since there is not a single FHIR resource that captures any or all of the EHR Attribution Columns, we cannot create an extension, else FHIR creates a new ATTRIBUTION resource. In the interim, how do we expose the EHR Attribution Columns to consuming FHIR clients and 3rd party? Use the same EHR Attribution Columns names and mention in the capability statement as non-FHIR complaint elements? Please let me know?</p>

<p>Hi Lloyd, just sent you the definition. Importantly, there are two questions? First do we recommend to the FHIR committee to create another FHIR resource for ATTRIBUTION?  Secondly, in other similar scenarios, how do we map so many EHR columns to FHIR, if there is NO corresponding match in FHIR resource and elements. Do we publish, it as non FHIR conferment columns?</p>

<p>Hi Lloyd, The word "Attribution" may be confusing , for simplicity, consider the word "association".  Attribution or "assignment" is a key program methodology used to identify the members associated with a PCP and Payer during a course of time, preferable over a period of month. This helps maintains history and help us derive several measures. Not necessarily Paid for Value, PMPM, etc.</p>

<p>Thank you Lloyd, and I understand. In the interim, I need to revert back to my second question iterated in several chats: Till the matter of "ATTRIBUTION" is under review with FHIR members, how do I represent/expose ATTRIBUTION API's as JSON objects in FHIR server?  Will other parties understand these non-FHIR resource "ATTRIBUTION"? and perform GET, PUT and POST? </p>
<p>In other similar scenarios, how do we map so many EHR columns to FHIR, if there is NO corresponding match in FHIR resource and elements (for example, "ATTRIBUTION"). Do we publish, it as non FHIR conferment columns?</p>

<p>If we can't find an appropriate home for an element, you can use the extension mechanism to capture pretty much whatever you can imagine.  (But it's better to use core elements whenever appropriate.)</p>

<p>Hi Roney A,<br>
I'm trying to understand your questions, but my 1st question back to you is where are you getting these data elements from? You are calling these EHR columns - are these fields out of some EHR somewhere?  <br>

<p>Best, and is critical to go over the CMS mandated requirements, understand their business definition,  and align accordingly to FHIR. ATTRIBUTION is very well articulated by CMS.</p>

<p>Before I commit, could you please list those Pharmacy Claim columns in question? I may have listed a few, and lost track of it, as there was no corresponding match in FHIR. Pharmacy claim and PBM both are huge subject areas and impact the financial model through Claims.</p>

<p>Thank you Mary. As mentioned earlier, these are the Column fields that are captured in any major EHR enterprise data model, that captures pharmacy claims, dental claims, institutional claims, and professional claims,  -837i, 837p, &amp; 837d, PBM, etc, and much more... Strongly, recommend to review the CMS links around the "ATTRIBUTION" entity. It is self explanatory and poses a strong need to establish a resource name "ATTRIBUTION" in FHIR.</p>

<p>Thank you Lloyd. Agreed. It does imply, that if we choose to use "extension mechanism" we would not directly tie it to the resource "ATTRIBUTION", as it does not exist in FHIR. We have to use extension mechanism, across multiple meaningful FHIR resources and split the attribution columns accordingly. Assuming, that is the correct understanding?</p>

<p>There is no "attribution" resource.  There are resources that reflect enrollment, elligibility, membership in a care team and a variety of other things.  I suspect that some aspects of the concept of "attribution" will turn out to fit in one of those places - but leaving it to those who are more familiar with CMS and U.S. claims processes to evaluate the 'where'.</p>

<p>Attribution is US Realm centric enrollment item. Some plans 'assign' a member/patient/recipient to a particular Provider up front (PCP or specialist or both). In other cases, the Provider is assigned based on claims submitted.</p>

<p>Hi Lloyd, how are we addressing the challenges of creating FHIR APIs between different  EHR FHIR versions  running R4, R3, and/or R2? Not clear how the CapabilityStatement /fhirVersion mime type parameter will address the conversion? Do we need to write a conversion routine for all the different FHIR versions? Or, do we create different end-points for different versions to address change between versions of FHIR? Please let me know?</p>
