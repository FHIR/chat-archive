<p>Hi Lloyd–just to recap on FHIR resources and elements, do we only deploy on FHIR Server those FHIR resources and elements that we only need (cherry-pick) now, or a better approach to deploy ALL FHIR resources and elements on FHIR Server.  As our future data requirements for FHIR resources and elements may change and may require additional FHIR resources and elements? Any best practices on the approach to deploy FHIR resources and elements based on short-term vs long-term interoperability needs?</p>

<p>Not sure why this is a question for the CCDA stream.  In general, you deploy what you have working (and have business rules coded and tested for).  You don't want to stand something up and have people start throwing data into it or accessing it if you haven't figured out what the rules should be.</p>

<p>Thank you Lloyd for the clarification. It makes sense.</p>
