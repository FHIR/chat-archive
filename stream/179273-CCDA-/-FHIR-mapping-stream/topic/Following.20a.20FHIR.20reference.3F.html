<p>In trying to do the FHIR-&gt;CCDA transform, I'm trying to figure out how to follow the reference to a contained resource so that I can map that resource's data elements to the CCDA entries.  I <em>think</em> this can be done via pointer and evaluate, but the documentation is quite light about that and I haven't been able to get it to work.<br>
Scenario: Composition.section has a reference to an AllergyIntolerance resource contained within the Bundle.  I want/need to get access to the AllergyIntolerance resource so that I can map the elements to this CCDA section's entries.<br>
Is this doable and, if so, what am I missing with pointer/evaluate?</p>
