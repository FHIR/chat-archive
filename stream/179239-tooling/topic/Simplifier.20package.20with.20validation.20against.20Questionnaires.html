<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="203235">@Ward Weistra</span>  On Simplifier, I am working on an IG that contains a number of Questionnaires. Validating QuestionnaireResponse against them is a major part of the "IG functionality", they are actively used validation artefacts - hence, it is key that they get loaded by any tooling using the FHIR package for this IG. However, I am not sure how to do this. I initially created a package in Simplifier using the options "Move all resources to the package folder" = true and "Move the examples to the examples folder"=true. However, as Simplifier classifies Questionnaires as examples, they land in the examples folder and are not seen by e.g. the JAR validator. I suspect unticking the latter setting will merely mean that the Questionnaires don't get included at all (whereas I want them in the package folder, I guess) - but would rather not release a new package merely to test that <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span>. How can I solve this?</p>

<p>(BTW I must confess I never understood the classification of Questionnaires as examples - in my world they act much more like profiles and QuestionnaireResponses are the matching examples)</p>

<p>Great question <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194703">@Morten Ernebjerg</span>. You could uncheck 'Move the examples to the examples folder' which should keep them in /package instead of /package/examples. But it will also put any other examples you have there. I made an example here: <a href="https://simplifier.net/packages/acme.base/0.0.10-no-move-examples">https://simplifier.net/packages/acme.base/0.0.10-no-move-examples</a>, which has all Patient examples in /package directly.</p>
<p>You can also choose to fully arrange the folder structure yourself. Then you would structure already in your <a href="http://Simplifier.net">Simplifier.net</a> Project everything in /package and /package/examples how you want it, and uncheck both move options on package creation.</p>
<p>I'll discuss whether we should reclassify Questionnaire instances as conformance resources instead of Examples!</p>
<p>Finally, you can create multiple package lines from your project. So if you want to test package creation secretly:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the Packages tab, click Create new package</li>
<li>Select Status: Private</li>
<li>Test creating package versions to there, until you're happy. Note that private packages won't be accessible by outside tools (and even some <a href="http://in-Simplifier.net">in-Simplifier.net</a> tools)</li>
<li>Only then create a new package on your official, public package line</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for the thorough answer and the tips, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="203235">@Ward Weistra</span> ! I think just throwing the whole kitchen sink into /package will do the trick for now.</p>

<p>Can this be done inside Simplifier? - in see no option for creating a folder structure in the file manager. Or is it only possible by creating the folder structure outside Simplifier and then pushing/uploading the whole thing as a zip?</p>

<p>On each resource you can go to Settings &gt; Properties and just put <code>package/</code> in front of the file name. In the File Manager (Project page &gt; Manage &gt; File manager) you can check all the file paths.<br>
Downloading full project + change folder structure + empty project (with File manager) + uploading project is likely easier, if you're not afraid of losing things like resource history and linked issues.</p>
