<p>Hi everyone, I'm hoping someone can orient me. There is probably a simple document to look at for this, but I don't know how to find it. I'm trying to understand the difference between these three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>IG Package last uploaded to Simplifier on Nov 2019</li>
<li>The current live IG (docs)</li>
<li>What will be proposed in May</li>
</ol>
<p>Does (2) have content that is not in (1)? Is there someplace I can view the diff between (3) and (2)? </p>
<p>I'm asking from the perspective of an Implementer who is interested in modeling Clinical Genomics reports. But I'm interested in theoretical considerations as well.</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>

<p>The draft for May is still being confirmed, so too early to give all the specifics. The published version is DSTU 1, in May DSTU2 will be sent out for Ballot. There is not a specific diff page yet. However, some highlights are: consolidation in the pharmacogenomics space with medication-Transporter, medication-High-Risk, medication-Metabolism and medication-Efficacy begin moved to components in Therapeutic Implication. New Operation: $find-subject-variants    <br>
Retrieves variants from a specified genomic region. Changes to some examples: <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/artifacts.html#examples">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/artifacts.html#examples</a>. But wait for more information in the coming weeks.</p>
