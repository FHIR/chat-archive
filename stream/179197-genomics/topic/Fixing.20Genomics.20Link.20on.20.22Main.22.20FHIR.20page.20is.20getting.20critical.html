<p>The ONC just created pages to "educate their workforce on FHIR" :  <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/standards-technology/standards/fhir-fact-sheets">https://www.healthit.gov/topic/standards-technology/standards/fhir-fact-sheets</a>  ... the first link to FHIR on the page takes you here:  <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/">http://www.hl7.org/fhir/</a>  and this is where the genomics link still takes you to a very confusing and inappropriate page rather than our IG.  Last week I saw a post from a very high level executive at Microsoft where he mentioned genomics standards and he linked to the same "incorrect" page.  I know that we discussed putting the dragon and clear color indicator with message saying this is deprecated material do not use (then providing a link to the proper page).  What is the status of that? Are we waiting for a new release of FHIR? Is there any way our WG can see a mock-up of the page clearly stating it is deprecated?</p>

<p>The 4B genomics page is still largely focused on the deprecated artifacts. The updates we put on that page are not set to show up until R5.</p>

Do we know when R5 will be balloted?</p>

<p>In R4B, we can't remove the content nor deprecate it.  All we can do is adjust the wording of the note that points to the IG.  R4B must remain strictly substitutable for R4.  R5, on the other hand, you're free to yank out all the genomics profiles from the core spec entirely.  (They were never normative, so there's no need to even deprecate them.)  You're also free to re-write the page.</p>

<p>R5 will likely be published in mid 2022 - assuming we adhere to the current schedule.</p>
<p>This doesn't seem like a board-level decision.  From a formal process perspective, deprecating or removing artifacts isn't a technical correction.  So we'd need a whole new release of FHIR.   In theory, we could do an STU update process that doesn't require a full ballot, but it's still a significant amount of effort to perform - at a time when we barely have enough energy to get R4B and R5 done.  I expect the FMG would push back hard at the notion of another interim release just to formally deprecate/remove artifacts that'll be removed in a year where there's already clear text at the top of the page pointing implementers elsewhere.</p>

<p>It wasn't flagged as an R4B issue.  You might be able to lean on OO to get it applied as part of R4B.</p>
