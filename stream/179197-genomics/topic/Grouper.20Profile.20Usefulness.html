<p>One more question for the stream:</p>
<p>I haven’t really been seeing the Observation Grouper get much attention in the spec, but it looks very useful to me. </p>
<p>For example, say there is a DiagnosticReport that documents a test that found 5 variants and each of those variants come along with one haplotype and one diagnostic implication. In a flat DiagnosticReport, those Observations could end up structured like this..</p>
<p>DiagnosticReport<br>
|--result<br>
....|--Variant 1<br>
|--result<br>
....|--Haplotype 1 (derived from Variant 1)<br>
|--result<br>
....|--Haplotype 3 (derived from Variant 3)<br>
|--result<br>
....|--Diagnostic Implication 2 (derived from Variant 2)<br>
|--result<br>
....|--Variant 2<br>
|--etc</p>
<p>This structure is possibly needlessly scrambled, but there is no order requirement for diagnostic reports, so systems should be able to handle this “scrambled” report the same way as one that might have the results “in the right order” – or at least an order that makes more sense to humans.<br>
If we were to recommend the use of groupers, we could have reports that look like this:<br>
DiagnosticReport<br>
|--result<br>
....|--Group 1<br>
........|--HasMember Reference to Haplotype 1 (derived from Variant 1)<br>
........|--HasMember Reference to Variant 1<br>
........|--HasMember Reference to Diagnostic Implication 1 (derived from Variant 1)<br>
|--result<br>
....|--Group 3 <br>
|--result<br>
....|--Group 2<br>
 |--etc.</p>
<p>In this structure, data can still be scrambled, but is more organized. Notably, this organization is intended to create a group composed of a variant and any other Observations “derivedFrom” or logically associated with that variant. Each non-variant Observation would need to contain some way of communicating this relationship (likely with a reference back to the original Observation variant), but this should still allow each Observation to stand on its own. I would think this would be useful for any situation where other Observations besides the variant is being reported.</p>
<p>Is there a reason we are not recommending data be represented this way and instead kind of leaving it open? </p>
<p>Additionally, would there be a problem if we were to represent the data in the second format? </p>

<p>We were actually just talking about this on the OO call yesterday too - I forget exactly what the topic was but it occurred to me that the "observation grouper" concept was relevant in that setting too.  Effectively like v2's OBX-4, where there are multiple observations which are related to each other (but can, strictly speaking, stand alone so .component isn't appropriate).  Any OO folks remember or have the notes?  Looks like they're not posted yet (<a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/OO/2021-03-04+Main">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/OO/2021-03-04+Main</a>)</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256919">@Hayden Bader</span> this is good feedback. So you are proposing to use the Grouper profile to group together all observations related to a variant? We have tossed around several ideas for Grouper so far but not sure we had considered that one. To date we feel like it will likely be a useful we just haven’t decided the right way to leverage it. Other ideas so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>sections of the report </li>
<li>panels of the test</li>
<li>features like ‘gene’<br>
The section and panel ideas might likely be solved better by the introduction of a Composition attribute on Diagnostic report that would allow the expression of structure on a report and its results.  However grouping by Variant is close to the feature grouping I had mentioned. It is probably an idea worth exploring. <br>
And as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194329">@Daniel Rutz</span> points out, this has always felt like something that could be more generally applicable. I will be curious to hear more about the O&amp;O discussion.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span>  yeah that's essentially what I'm proposing. I'm not saying that needs to be its only use, but it feels like it'd be useful from a processing standpoint. I've been told we might see ~100 variants on some complicated genomic reports. If each of them has one associated haplotype and one associated diagnostic implication, that quickly becomes 300 Observations (despite there possibly being even more associated Observations). From a software perspective, that feels worrisome - if an Observation I'm trying to format references another Observation I haven't processed yet (due to weird ordering shenanigans). </p>
<p>I also think conceptually, it makes some sense. The "result" of a lab test for genomics conceptually seems to more be the literal finding in the variant + the incidental findings and implications. The groupers in these cases would/could be more representative of that concept.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194329">@Daniel Rutz</span>  I'm not sure if this is what you were thinking with regards to O&amp;O, but I could see the above being generalizable.</p>
<p>That being said, take that bit with a grain of salt. This is kind of me looking at things based on how we model genomic data. It might not actually work in real-world scenarios. But I guess that might be the point of discussing it.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194329">@Daniel Rutz</span> I just posted the 3/4 notes you are referring to. We talked about it as part of the reflex order discussion - the use of observation.has member feels more like use of OBX-4. We had talked about talking more about this on next Monday's specimen call.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256919">@Hayden Bader</span> I don't see "derived from" being used in your hierarchy picture. This is used to relate between variant findings and things like therapeutic implications, also between haplotypes and variants there is a link. So the nesting you are suggesting is accomplished through using the related reference links found in the profiles.</p>

<p>Software implementation processing from FHIR to a relational database, as an example, might benefit from processing links last</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span> </p>
<p>So two things here:<br>
1) I'm going to repost the model I'm imagining<br>
DiagnosticReport<br>
|--result<br>
....|--Group 1<br>
........|--HasMember Reference to Haplotype 1 (<strong>derived from</strong> Variant 1)<br>
........|--HasMember Reference to Variant 1<br>
........|--HasMember Reference to Diagnostic Implication 1 (<strong>derived from</strong> Variant 1)<br>
|--result<br>
....|--Group 3<br>
|--result<br>
....|--Group 2<br>
|--etc.</p>
<p>What I imagine this would look like in a report is Group 1 would be 4 Observations. The Grouper piece would have a reference to haplotype 1, diagnostic implication 1, and variant 1. Variant 1 would stand on its own, and Haplotype 1 / Diagnostic Implication 1 would have a reference to Variant 1 through their "derivedFrom" properties. This way we essentially end up having an organizational structure that groups "everything known about and because of variant 1" - which I've also been calling the "result" - that whole piece together. We also still communicate that "we know about haplotype 1 because of variant 1" without having to rely on the grouper. </p>
<p>2) From a relational database standpoint, processing the links last seems costly especially as the number of flattened elements increases. <br>
Ex: I have 10 therapeutic implications - each of which was determined because of 1 (or more) variants (aka derivedFrom). In order to process the relational components last, I might need to pause processing a therapuetic implication as soon as I see it is derivedFrom something - which would likely require holding on to some part of it in memory. I think this gets worse as more things are derived from a given variant and as more complex relationships pop up. It might be that the observations with no relationships should be processed first, but then I would think you might end up sifting through all sent observations to find the terminal ones - then you might need to iterated back over your list to see what can now be processed.  </p>
<p>I will note that for groupers, you probably would still probably want to process the relational pieces last, but if we could set the groupers up to group what generally is related, I think it becomes a little easier to break the original list into groups of smaller things you could check for relationships between - if that makes sense</p>

<p>Do you have a system that you could demo into which you are processing the data? Something like this: FHIR endpoint/server connected to underlying non-FHIR architecture feeding into application which displays. If so, it would be awesome to bring to a connectathon. Cerner brought their sandbox and ELIMU brought their SMART-on-FHIR application to a connectathon once. But the process started from the genetic observations (not a processed diagnostic report). I think the target of your implementation would be informative. If there was a way to have something to share as a system in the connectathon that might be really helpful. Jamie is cooking something up for displaying, but that'll only be one implementation. Once the report is consumed, I wonder how you'll implement the FHIR queries.</p>

<p>No system right now. We're going to focus on making sure we can represent outgoing genomics data before trying to process incoming data. We have talked a bit about how a diagnostic report would even be consumed, and a worry that has come out of that is scaling/references. Processing a diagnostic report with 10 results would likely mean wanting to validate each result in some way which would likely be even more annoying if they reference each other. (Assuming you want to save/interpret the discrete data as opposed to just display a reconstructed view of what was sent).</p>
<p>Yeah, you could probably send the links to another table for processing later, but as soon as that happens, you should be wary of processing the piece doing the linking because that might only be valid as soon as the link is resolved. That would likely result in some sort of loop for chains - A-&gt;B-&gt;C <br>
1) resolve C<br>
2) check references<br>
3) B has all references resolved<br>
4) finish / resolve B<br>
etc.  <br>
That's not necessarily bad, but might scale poorly and could have a single point of failure - if C fails, we'd likely need to bubble up to fail A. Though I will grant that this may be an overcomplicated assumption of what could happen</p>

<p>Let's move on to think about grouper. Does it solve the problem of resolving references? And recall in FHIR a reference can be a URL that indicates a profile instance that is not in the message (id of a patient profile that can be retrieved but not the actual patient profile itself).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span> <br>
From a processing standpoint, groupers don't really solve the referencing issue. You could even say that groupers just end up adding an extra reference. That being said, even if they end up increasing some sort of resolution chain length, I don't think they complicate the underlying technical issue. However, structuring data that way may make resolving some pieces of that easier down the road especially if we can make some assumptions / recommendations. (This is in addition to just the organizational benefits I was initially talking about). </p>
<p>It sounds like you've thought about this a bit, so I'd be interested in whether you have some sort of planned system?</p>
<p>But an example assumption I would want to try to make is that for a gropuer, each member is resolvable to the same FHIR server. Now, there's nothing that guarantees this, and you could probably code a general solution, but 90% of the time, I would think it's reasonable for a literal observation and a derived observation to be represented in the same system. </p>
<p>In the scenario where the processor needs to resolve other references, this would at the least help with making fewer requests to other servers. You can do a search on _id=&lt;grouperID&gt;&amp;_include=Observation:hasMember. There's a chance that a really smart processor could compile a list of which references are on the same server / have a similar base URL, but that seems a bit risky to me.</p>
<p>In the scenario where all references are local (either sent in the bundle or somehow already on the server) each of the pieces is logically now a lot more separable. By construction, the grouper I'm talking about should contain its interrelated observations. Then, all the diagnostic report processing might look like is whether each of the groupers is a full grouper - as opposed to whether each of the included Observations has each of its references. There'd also need to be some validation in the end, but the overall possible options of which references can interrelate should decrease.</p>

<p>one potential best practice guidance is to have every result either be on the report or hasMember of a grouper result... I may be wrong but I don't think we want folks to use haplotypes/genotypes/implications (derivedFrom) to be the only way to find a result.</p>

<p>Good stuff <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196553">@Jamie Jones</span> Two thoughts:</p>

<li>Should we remove the word 'panel' from the diagram labels? I think panel has a different meaning that how we are using it? At least I recall <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span> saying something similar.</li>
<li>Agree 100% on your guidance suggestion above. That fits nicely with the 'rarely deeper than 2 levels' in the DiagnosticReport guidance we found.</li>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196553">@Jamie Jones</span>  I prefer the original images you had to the new ones. I think the originals make it clearer that the references are linking to existing observations. The figures where Observation 1 is repeated twice makes it ambiguous as to whether there are two "Observation 1"s.</p>
<p>The search query question kind of was resolved for me at the May Connectathon. My takeaway from that was that the best way to return data was that if category = genomics/genetics (there's another JIRA for that), then we return all of the Observations that inherit from the base genomics profile. From there, you can key in by specifying code or the like on other pieces.</p>
<p>So you could do something like this:<br>
Observation?patient=&lt;patient&gt;&amp;category=genomics&amp;code=grouper -&gt; to get all of the groupers (last I checked, the grouper code was the tbd code for the grouper profile)</p>
<p>The query piece that I was referring to in my previous message was that if a third party were to try to get their data to show up on a FHIR server in any of the pictured formats, that the more options you have for how things could be linked, the more tangled the resolution becomes. Which is what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196476">@Arthur Hermann</span> says. <br>
Edit: Or at least how I interpret what Arthur said</p>
<p>This is a bigger issue for genomics because the various Observations are inherently linked, but this is kind of a thing that FHIR generally would need to solve for cases where data is intended to relate together. As it stands, it has seemed to me that a lot of FHIR resource creates can stand on their own, so resolution of references hasn't been as big of a deal.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> We had a similar discussion (on grouper profiles at least) back at the June 7, 2021 meeting. I'm fine with the spec being less prescriptive - especially if it allows us to represent the data we want to which is currently the first figure Jamie linked.</p>
<p>However, I do think that at some point users are going to coalesce around a common way of representing genomics information. I understand where the work group is coming from in that we don't want prevent anyone looking to use the spec from representing the data the way they want. Adding additional documentation/examples serves as a sort of good middle ground to guide others without telling them what needs to be done. But by my view, I think at some point that's going to hit a roadblock... though it also might be that a consensus more naturally evolves as genomic information exchange becomes more common and tools get built out.</p>

It speaks to the diagnostic report as a vehicle to deliver the data as well as a way of indicating meaning (indicating meaning is the purpose of grouper, right?).</p>

<p>I'm suggesting that rather than trying to provide a lot of guidance as to how or how not to use grouper, we just accept that it's there, that it's use will vary (despite our guidance), and the intent of the query advice is to help people understand that as a result, observations of potential interest will be variably nested beneath the root document, and they should consider that in their queries (with some examples).</p>

<p>The query for the report is self-evident. You query for genomic reports (it's the packaging by the system on the other side of the FHIR server that is where effort lies. Some systems will retain the report as it was received exactly - so pretty quick response, others will need to build it).</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove Grouper profile (will involve updating several artifacts, like examples)</li>
<li>Add implementation guidance describing how our Genomic Observations can be grouped, using Jamie's diagrams as the basis for that guidance</li>
<li>Add query guidance based on the implementation guidance described above, showing common patterns and give hints as to various </li>

<p>Example from the page: <br>
Public Health<br>
Today Registrars manually translate clinical data into public health reporting systems. This data is used to monitor and improve public health (e.g. surveillance and clinical research). In the future, this data will be extracted from the EHR in an automated (or semi-automated) fashion.</p>
<p>For a breast cancer clinical genomic study, get all genetic observations of patients where the variant is associated with breast cancer as a genetic risk. There is some heterogenity in the codes which maybe used to indicate phenotypes. Here we have used the NCI metathesaurus code for Breast Cancer, "C9335," as a likely code to be used. The following query returns all variants that have an annotation of "Breast Cancer" using the NCI metathesaurus code for Breast Cancer, "C9335." "code-value-concept" is a construct to use the code of an Observation instance and the code of a value for the Observation. The Observation.code = 81259-4, "Associated Phenotype," is used for the iG's "Inherited Disease Pathogenicity" profile. The value in this case is NCI metathesaurus code for Breast Cancer, "C9335." Additionally, the "_include:iterate=Observation:derived-from" iteratively follows the Observation.derived-from link. "_include:iterate=Observation:derived-from" tells the FHIR API to look for variants that the annotation is derived from. The iterate modifier is needed as the direct target of a derived-from relationship can be a hapolotype which has a derived-from relationship to a variant (note: haplotypes can have derived-from other haplotypes which makes the number of observations returned larger).</p>

<p>I am not a programmer - so my input here may not be beneficial - that is fair, just let me know.  As can be seen by the excellent diagrams Jaime created, there can be a lot of complexity in the relationship between the report, observations, variants, implications etc....  I thought that Grouper was created to diminish that complexity. If in fact, it does not do so - then it seems that it helpful from a conceptual point of view, but not from a programmatic point of view. Can somebody explain this to me?  If Grouper is helpful as a conceptual concept, then I can see us dropping it. but it it actually allows a programmer to organize their code more easily, then I would still like to see it remain.</p>

<p>Grouping is done to provide a way of organizing content.  Computers generally don't need content to be organized, because they can organize however they like based on metadata, so groupers aren't there to make computation easier.  In fact, they make it harder.  Their purpose is to make navigation easier for humans - and to allow authors to dictate how they <em>want</em> humans to navigate.</p>

<p>Not sure. You and I spoke about removing grouper. It's easy enough to have an example of a profile not using grouper and one using it. But I think it's an important illustration for folks to understand what grouper does or does not do. </p>
<p>It's easy enough to add/change or subtract. But let's have a look at the Emerge and oncology examples in without grouper</p>

<p>A : Yes. I started with updating examples. </p>
<p>B: You'd like Jaime's diagrams to be the basis for using Observation to group things without grouper? right?</p>
<p>C: Query is interesting. There's no changes to query guidance really, but I can point out the specific queries, and create queries based on the specific examples. <br>
How it looks depends on the type of query.<br>
E.g. give me all implications (or diagnosis or variants) in the report - easier to do without grouper as you now just ask for the results with the right observation.code rather than have to look through all the groupers. I can put in two examples. </p>
<p>E.g. give me the panel of connected results - hopefully the right observsation.code has been used for the Panel observation that is using has member. So you just ask for all the members of the panel (follow has members link). You'd not be able to do that with our grouper profile. </p>
<p>E.g. give me all the profiles linked to the genotype (or haplotype or whatever), follow the links in the profiles with the query iteratively - we've some examples of that now.</p>

<p>So in that diagram, I would suggest we simply remove the Grouper profile.</p>
<p>For other guidance, we keep a section <em>on the general page</em> named 'Grouping Observations' perhaps include 1..* of Jamie's diagrams, along with some textual guidance.

<p>I can redo the ones done with lucid chart (if the files are in git). Be great If you redo the figs on the pharmacogenomics guidance page (seems like it should be a generic observation profile...which gives us a need for an observation.code). Don't worry about it in the figure. I will add something appropriate in the guidance and the emerge diagnostic example.</p>

<p>Sorry folks, I haven't really had time to respond to this. I don't think that the groupers should be removed.</p>
<p>From this thread, the most I've gotten is that groupers should be removed because they make data processing more complicated. That is technically true, but that seems like a weak reason to "remove" a part of that spec. And <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196553">@Jamie Jones</span>  neither of those JIRAs really goes into any more details about groupers being removed or why groupers should be removed.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span> <br>
I haven't seen the proposal on panels, but for querying for all of the diagnosticImplications, you should just use the code for diagnostic implication defined in the profile.  </p>
<p>Additionally, the proposed withoutGrouper branch is now ceding all control over grouping. Before, CG would have had some say in what a group is. Now, it looks like any lab could define whatever type of grouping they wanted - even adding additional data to their grouping observations. That may allow more labs to <em>use</em> the spec, but it's going to <em>impede</em> labs from communicating with the spec.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256919">@Hayden Bader</span> - First off, the JIRAs haven't been kept update with the latest discussions. Sorry about that. I will let <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span> and others weigh in as well, but I wanted to mention that Grouper was just seen unnecessary overhead within the IG since FHIR Observations support the grouping without our profile. The only unique thing provided by the profile was a common <code>Observation.code</code> which wasn't really providing much value (it wasn't even a real code, it was one of our TBD codes), and really was introducing confusion. We tried explaining that a grouper was just a generic grouping of observations, and didn't have meaning beyond that, but questions about usage remained.</p>
<p>Wish I could give you more, but I have a busy day today and have to leave it there. Feel free to respond with more, and I hope that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196553">@Jamie Jones</span> or others can also weigh in.

<p>I can add that while we have yet to request any real control over grouping, we do currently provide a code people can use to tell systems "this is just a grouping obs". Since grouping isn't required or consistent, however, receiving and rendering systems will need to be robust against coded, uncoded, and potentially redundant grouping.</p>

<p>Kevin's nailed it. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256919">@Hayden Bader</span>  To clarify, <strong>only the CG specific Observation profile called 'Grouper' was removed in the branch</strong>. It did  extremely little, and did not stop an implementer from grouping in any way they wished. The branch shows that Observation can directly be used for those that want to create groupings.</p>
<p>Panels are more interesting. If your panel has a specific code, such as a Panel LOINC code, you could use that code for the Observation.code and create structures similarly (and more meaningfully) to the grouping observations in the branch.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> I think I understand the issue/disconnect a bit better. Right now, we receive genomics data through HL7v2 in a bundle of implications and variants. It's essentially a grouper. So, groupers end up not looking like unnecessary overhead to us, but instead a familiar structure. We met internally a bit to discuss groupers / examples more this week, and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="444104">@Scott Isaac</span> is working on getting something ready. </p>
<p>But as a start, our use case was derived from the V2 way of representing genomics data. And I would think that if labs were previously interested in V2 that having the FHIR structure more clearly mimic it, it might be a gateway to getting labs more easily involved.</p>

<p>Hayden - I think for the most part, Labs are not used for sending Genomic information in V2 (except those that Epic has nudged along that path <span aria-label="grinning" class="emoji emoji-1f600" role="img" title="grinning">:grinning:</span> )...  The majority are still sending PDFs. I am speaking of genomics labs here, rather than labs that do a lot of tests and also do genomic tests. So except for the aforemenioned my read of the environment is that genomics labs will need to set up a good deal of their messaging from scratch to send machine readable genomic data. </p>
<p>Are you able to share with the WG what your use cases is? Are you and your team currently working on mapping the V2 work that you have used with many clients to FHIR?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span> No, we're not looking at help processing an incoming message right now.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> That's my understanding of it. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="249407">@Rachel Kutner</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194329">@Daniel Rutz</span> could speak more about it than me.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196476">@Arthur Hermann</span> Right now, it's a similar response as the one to Bret. We internally have data that represents genomics results from orders.

<p>Here's a picture <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256919">@Hayden Bader</span>  that may help - it shows how all the OBXs related to a particular variant have the same value in OBX-4</p>

<p>Might be worth noting what I think is an important distinction between the HL7 v2 LRR guide vs. FHIR Genomics IG. In the LRR guide, the OBX-4 grouping mechanism is required, it is THE way in which to associate, say, a phenotype with a variant. In the FHIR Genomics IG, an implication instance has a required derivedFrom relationship. The contents in the picture would be represented as a diagnosticImplication that is derivedFrom a variant.</p>

<p>Bob's said it well. The relationships like hasMemeber and derivedFrom are key in processing incoming messages in FHIR to understand how it all goes together computably.</p>

'move most of the guidance in the grouperless branch to the query guidance page, leave a note/link to it from general with a scoping paragraph.' </p>
<p>I have changed the guidance on the general page. The Pharmacogenomics-EMERGE example page is not changed yet. Query guidance change in progress. </p>

I wanted to clarify this because I was on record as saying we would do this as "Persuasive with Change" but honestly that felt wrong as I put the proposal together.</p>
<p>Note - this is still just the proposal, so not set in stone yet. We will review the examples from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256919">@Hayden Bader</span> to help us see the specific use case. In the end, we might accept what we have now and log a new JIRA to support the request from Hayden and Rachel - or, we might completely change the current proposal.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span>   I suggest that the Title of this section be: Grouping Observations  (delete the word About)... However, possibly the title should be Grouping Genomic Observations. The wording may be important to the question of whether we are just speaking of grouping within our IG, or whether there is overlap or broader reference to observations (e.g O&amp;O). I think we are focused only on our IG. If this is the case, then we definitely should call this section Grouping Genomic Observations.</p>

<li>It shows the name of the 'branch' that, if the person working on it does right, should give good hint as to what is being worked on.</li>
<li>It is not the most friendly page in the world, but it is 'built in' to how the FHIR IGs are built (so no extra work)</li>
<li>It has many very old branches that are completely out of date, so make sure to look at the date to see what is most recent and ignore old stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will still contemplate something better.</p>

<p>The current R4 definition of <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extension-diagnosticreport-summaryof.html">summaryOf</a> is honestly pretty light: "A summary report that points to subordinate target reports."

<p>I want to hear from others on this one, but it's not that we are "not making a determination on groupers/grouping" - we are "not currently constraining what sort of grouping is allowed" - meaning our determination on groupers/grouping as of now is to allow the base Observation features to cover this for us.<br>
I am personally fine with providing the guidance that the best practice is to reference all Observations from the report for the reasons listed.</p>

<p>I'm looking to add the text in italics: The genetic findings, implications and region studied profiles all contain links to computably define their relationships (e.g. the variant observation is referenced within the implication profile using derivedFrom). <em>That is, the relationships define a semantic grouping, a composite relationship between implication, haplotype, genotype observations and the appropriate  variant observations.</em></p>

<p>Thanks Jamie, so seemingly returns everything we want in both cases, right? Although, I suppose the DRs include result() references to All observations. Should our example that includes group observations only have those group observations be referenced from DR.result ? I still like the guidance that everything should be referenced, but it might be worth ensuring that we will still get all results with that query if someone send that?</p>

<p>BTW to further test out the query, I did some additional examples, including a very contrived one where only a single grouper pointing to Therapeutic implications was referenced by DisagnosticReport.result The query was able to iterate through the grouper hasMember and through the derivedFrom links to get to the variant observation. We could do additional tests but does that seem sufficient <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span></p>

<p>What kind of scenarios are you thinking Joel? Cases where someone sends an Implication that doesn't include a derivedFrom() to a Finding, even though it is supposed too? Error-like situations where observations are not linked correctly? Perhaps the situation that Lloyd mentioned yesterday (the other resources are on other servers)? Something else?</p>

<p>I got ya, thanks for the extra detail. This is where we have to decide how much detail we provide as guidance versus how much do we trust that implementers will read and understand the base spec. I suppose a statement similar to your response above might be sufficient to give our implementers a little nudge in reviewing how FHIR references work.</p>

<p>Based on today's conversation to add the page with extended guidance on grouping as an appendix - I wanted to note that the following changes should be included when we do so: </p>
<p>New Appendix Page and all references to it, should be called: "Grouping of Observations"</p>
<p>I would think that there should be a paragraph about grouping in the General Genomic Reporting Page (not just the Query section) - Do folks agree? : <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/general.html#general-genomic-reporting">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/general.html#general-genomic-reporting</a></p>
<p>Querying: Add some text re: grouping and point to the appendix for further information :<a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/branches/withoutGrouper/general.html#querying">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/branches/withoutGrouper/general.html#querying</a></p>
<p>Add the Appendix itself and text that describes the Appendix - On the Appendix Section on the "Landing Page" : <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/branches/withoutGrouper/index.html#appendices">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/branches/withoutGrouper/index.html#appendices</a></p>
<p>Please forgive my ignorance - but I see all of the activity on grouper being focused on Queries. I assume that the page (now to be an appendix) takes care of SENDING information using some type of grouped method correct? If so, this is what should be mentioned on the General Genomic Reporting Page (which also includes a short addition and link to the appendix in the Query section.</p>

<p>There is one currently and it will be modified. Here's the current text:<br>
Results observation profiles, like genomic observations, are typically referenced directly by a Diagnostic Report. For genomics this would be in the genomics report. The genetic findings, implications and region studied profiles all contain links to computably define their composite relationships (e.g. the variant observation is referenced within the implication profile using derivedFrom). Also, the observations could be organized into groups by other observations. See this grouping guidance for an overview with examples and considerations for processing reports.</p>
