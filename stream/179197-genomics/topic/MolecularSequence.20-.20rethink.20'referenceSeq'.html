<p>Yea, I was trying to think about how to best apply those principles myself <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192198">@Bob Freimuth</span> </p>
<p>I think my 'quick wins' for simplification would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove 'referenceSeqPointer' (doesn't seem like we would do this anytime soon)</li>
<li>Remove 'referenceSeqString' (probably not needed in many settings we want to use this)</li>
<li>Remove 'chromosome'  (it seems this is not a typical way to express a ref seq)</li>
<li>Remove 'windowStart' and 'windowEnd' (unless <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191916">@ Bob Milius</span>  needs them for HLA use cases)</li>
</ul>
<p>Welcome any/all feedback</p>

<p>Some verison of <code>windowStart</code> and <code>windowEnd</code> is important. If a URI is provided to point to the reference sequence (eg full gene), but the observation is based on a part of the sequence (eg. part of intron 1, exon1, part of intron 2), we need to know how much of the ref sequence was actually sequenced. This window into the reference sequence provides that.</p>

<p>umm...not sure why you'd remove the window information, kinda ambiguous without it. Chromosome and Build are informative but more useful to a human for readability. Strand and Orientation are to help in specifying exactly what is being referred to in the reference. </p>
<p>RefSeqString and ReferenceSeqPointer should not be removed if the only argument is that one does not see them being used soon. It is certainly a viable option that one might have sequenced a parent person and wish to relate a child's sequence to that parent sequence.</p>

<p>I am not sure MolSeq is ready to act as a 'reference sequence' at this point, but perhaps others disagree? That has been a problem with this resource from the beginning, it was just a large hodge-podge of whatever someone thought <strong>might</strong> be helpful. And we were left with something that was very difficult to understand and use.</p>

<p>Ok. you want a tumor comparison with germline example using MolecularSequence? Or, do you mean you'd rather not have MolecularResource at all?</p>
<p>I don't see a good reason to remove those fields for ReferenceSeqPointer and ReferenceSeqString. So far, the argument is that it might be confusing (but not on a conceptual level). It is a harder ask to request evidence of implementers needing and willing to use it. Hard to have the chicken-n-egg argument, again. As  a WG we took a stand early on that having the ability to discretely describe positional information was needed - whether or not it was being used in HL7v2 messages often at the time. The IM also reflects this.<br>
The two fields are handy tools for :<br>
How would you represent a link to a a comparison where a Child's genome is compared to a parent? Or a Tumor sequence with the patient's germline? </p>
<p>Can we come-up with an easy way to represent the above without them? Or, because the PDF representation does not  today typically portray data in that fashion, then we would advocate eliminating the options? I admit that they are pretty sophisticated mechanisms that provide an unprecedented level of precision. The idea that one's own germline is used as a reference to compare to a tumor is... But what do you use MolecularSequence for if you remove them? To me they are the defining elements of the resource.</p>

<p>I am saying I am a huge proponent of having guidance/examples for everything we have, down to the attribute level.  I will add I feel that way now a days anyway - I wasn't always this way). I am perfectly fine keeping MolSeq.</p>

<p>In short, we could build a lot of things to support a lot of use cases - but if we don't have an active need for them, and someone to provide good guidance + examples, and someone to help validate them, we end up ill-defined and therefore poorly used artifacts - which is often worse than no artifacts at all.</p>

<p>yep. The referenceSeq in that use case is a useful attribute to reduce the space of bioinformatic calculations - allowing some level of specificity in the message. It's not strictly needed if you're willing to BLAST the sequence sent.</p>

<p>The "window" bit discussed above sounds like what we've called ExtractedSequence, which is essentially a subsequence operation.  I've tried to keep these classes focused very tightly on the bare minimum of attributes that are necessary to represent a sequence, and encapsulate them as needed to achieve what I hope is unambiguous semantics. Specifying a "window" outside of these classes could result in usage of those attributes in different ways, such as defining a region on a sequence that might be important for something; that would be an interval or location in the IM, which is entirely different.</p>

<p>My understanding is the intended use of window is to assert that the instance is only concerned with the reference sequence between start and end. That is, any edits within the window are represented in the instance. Variants outside the window are not specified.</p>

<p>I might be wrong here, but I guess my point is that the IM model today might have the building blocks to model the attributes needed to represent an 'interrogated region' but it has no attributes that would allow someone to deliver an instance of something that could be received and appropriately interpreted as 'this is the interrogated region for a particular study we just performed'</p>
<p>Long story short, I am fine retracting my suggestion to simplify the referenceSeq backbone element. If we want to leave in the flexibility it affords today, then I might just ask that someone think about additional guidance we should provide.</p>

<p>the substance resources for nucleic acids and protein biochemical treatments have a specific need to be extremely explicit about the composition of the sequence. Even defining base modifications. Does the IM model and MolecularResource cover that? Could it make use of some of the same features? Or refer to a Substance profile when needed? </p>
<p>In the cases covered by Substance, there's no 'based-on' genetic reference mentioned. This means one would need to search in the genome or proteome to determine where the sequence was derived from. Can be done, I guess.</p>
