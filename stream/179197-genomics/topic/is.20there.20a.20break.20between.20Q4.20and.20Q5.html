<p>I know this was mentioned on a call but I can't find it in the notes. Is there a break between Q4 and Q5? I just want to make sure I have the right times (I don't have access to the Whova app yet)</p>

<p>looks like <a href="https://www.hl7.org/events/working_group_meeting/2021/05/index.cfm">https://www.hl7.org/events/working_group_meeting/2021/05/index.cfm</a> still has the same self-disagreement. Table says Q5 should start at 5:30GMT but all the scheduled events are 6-7:30</p>

<p>looking like there might be a mandatory virtual cookie break (high tea perhaps??)</p>
