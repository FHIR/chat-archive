<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194350">@lei</span>, on Sunday you added section to the "general" page on the family member history profiles.  Those don't fall within the scope of the reporting IG and we're not looking at deprecating them form where they're defined.  I'm going to yank that content back out.  (If anyone disagrees with this decision, please holler)</p>
