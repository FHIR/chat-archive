<p>I was just asked to be on the Program Committee of this semantic computing conference, which has interest in applications of semantic computing to medicine, and is colocated with Global Health 2021. <a href="https://www.iaria.org/conferences2021/SEMAPRO21.html">https://www.iaria.org/conferences2021/SEMAPRO21.html</a></p>
<p>If anyone is interested, e.g., in telling the story of shepherding the Clinical Genomics IG, I believe it would be warmly received. Submission deadline July 5th. Due to COVID, online attendance permitted, presenters do not need to travel. If interested, please feel free to follow up with me here or via my email. Thank you.</p>
