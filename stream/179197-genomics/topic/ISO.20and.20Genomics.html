<p>There was a question during our meeting last Tuesday re: what work ISO is doing regarding Genomic standards. This link will give you a good idea of the different  projects/standards, that are in-flight. It is important to look at the stage - with 10.x being a proposal and 30.x moving to a committee. <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/7546903/x/catalogue/p/0/u/1/w/1/d/1">https://www.iso.org/committee/7546903/x/catalogue/p/0/u/1/w/1/d/1</a></p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196476">@Arthur Hermann</span> . I would be interested in reviewing some of these, comparing against FHIR Genomics representations. Any idea who in HL7 might be able to help in that regard?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193751">@Bob Dolin</span>  one of our co-chairs mentioned that HL7 was a representative to ISO and has access to this info. I will try to see if I can find out anything further about that. If not, let's bring this back to our working group to see if someone can assist with follow-up and understanding of how HL7 works with ISO.</p>
