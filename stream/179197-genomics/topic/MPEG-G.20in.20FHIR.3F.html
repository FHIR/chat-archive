<p>Greetings everyone! <br>
Since the file format for genomics data MPEG-G will be released soon, we were asking ourselves how this kind of files could be embedded in FHIR. Our first thought was the Resource Media, which according to the Trial-Use Note, should be able to handle more than just audio, image and video files.<br>
"Observations that require the attachment data types are represented by the Media resource instead of Observation."<br>
Am I right with this assumption? <br>
Thank you in advance!</p>
