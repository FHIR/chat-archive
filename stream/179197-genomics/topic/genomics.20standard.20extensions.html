<p>I recently reviewed the list of FHIR standard extensions located in <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility-registry.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility-registry.html</a>. For several of those listed (e.g.: observation-geneticsGenomicSourceClass, observation-geneticsGene) we now represent them as components rather than extensions (which I suspect was what we originally had in the original DSTU2 version). This presents an ambiguous guidance for the same elements represented as both allowable standard extensions and components. It could be confusing for implementers.<br>
<strong>Question:</strong> should we keep these as standard extensions? Or should we work with FHIR-I to deprecate them once the CG Reporting IG v1.1 is published?</p>

<p>We weren't able to remove them from R4 due to release timing, but in R4B they should have deprecation warnings and they are supposed to be fully removed for R5, which looks correct</p>
