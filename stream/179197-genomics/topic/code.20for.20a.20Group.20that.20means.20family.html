<p>Hi, I have a requirement to store an identifier for a 'family' - as part of a familial genomic order (trio). So whilst all the participants are linked via FamilyHistory into a proper pedigree - I have no resource in my model to store a single 'identifier' for this family unit. I'm toying with introducing a Group that will reference all these patients and have the family identifier - and now need a code to say what this group is. Current best suggestion is 'Family' in the social context hierarchy of SNOMED  35359004|Family (social concept). Any thoughts out there as to a better code or code system? Is the basic premise of using a FHIR Group for this correct? Thanks</p>

<p>How do you define the bounds of a family?</p>

<p>I would propose adding the family identifier as an extension on FamilyMemberHistory, and possibly even requesting to add it as a first class attribute.  It is a common request for pedigrees.</p>

<p>I'm fine with adding an extension, we just need a robust definition of what the boundaries are for a "family"</p>

<p>I think 'family' is one of those ones that would be impossible to define in a general context - but would be possible to define and bound in the context of a genomic test. 'An identifier for all blood related members involved in a genomic test'? FamilyMemberHistory itself has no definition of what it means by family I note..</p>

<p>Yes, but it also doesn't try to define an identifier for the collection.  If you want to capture cousins 5 times removed, you can just establish the path to that person.  However, if we're going to "identify" a family, we need to have consisteincy around what it is that we're identifying</p>

<p>I'd be tempted to request new concepts from SNOMED International (or ADHA for AU release)</p>

<p>Using Group.identifier to hold the identifier for a trio (family unit) seems reasonable to me, assuming there's not another resource or profile that fits the requirement more closely.</p>
<p>However, using SNOMED 35359004|Family (social concept) as the Group.code for a genetic trio doesn't seem quite correct.</p>
