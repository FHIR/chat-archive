<p>Excellent work Kevin!  Thanks...   A minor suggestion - currently says: It should be noted that the Genomic File extension is not an appropriate way to send a copy of the report....  I suggest a change to:  It should be noted that the Genomic File extension is not an appropriate way to send a copy of the report (e.g. A PDF or other document containing the written report)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196553">@Jamie Jones</span>  I moved this to Zulip to ensure that others can see this discussion.  Jaime is referring to JIRA <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32415">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32415</a>     Referencing BAM, CRAM, VCF (and other standard genomic files). </p>
<p>He stated:   I drafted a potential rework of text for this section today on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19vFe9UD4_XRsa5c0ykcS8P-RmpNBDDeGP0jSFg5UuyM/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/19vFe9UD4_XRsa5c0ykcS8P-RmpNBDDeGP0jSFg5UuyM/edit</a>, please take a look. I don't mention the new extension there because I'm not sure we need it, but could add that part back in/after if we feel it helps. I think Liz's comments from before about presentedForm should  probably still go in.   </p>
<p>For those trying to catch-up on this issue - there are many comments in the JIRA and a number of linked google docs with drafts... </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196553">@Jamie Jones</span>  , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span>  - there is so much discussion going on regarding this issue, and there have been so many changes in the text with continuing comments from members of the WG - that I strongly belive we should bring this to the entire WG (either a Monday or Tuesday meeting), sum up where we stand, and what questions remain to be debated. Then determine who we would like to resolve those outstanding questions... thoughts?</p>

<p>For anyone else reviewing now, I would only review the current draft on my branch <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/branches/kp-file-attachments/general.html#file-attachments">here</a> and compare it to Jamie's potential rework of text linked above. In short, Jamie writes better than I, and he proposed not adding a new extension on DiagnosticReport but using the built in attribute (DocumentReference.context.related) to link from the Genomics File to the Genomics Report. That is probably the key question to answer tomorrow.</p>

<p>From the call today, seems like we have a key decision to make - how should our profiling/guidance discuss the appropriate way(s) to link the report and the file. And I say way(s), as we might want to use multiple of these:</p>
<ol>
<li>New extension (genomics-file) specifically discussing how to associate files files to the report</li>
<li>Update guidance to use existing extension (supporting-information) discussing that it can be used to associate files to the report</li>
<li>Use DocumentReference.context.related to refer from the file to the report</li>
</ol>
<p>We probably need guidance for #3 no matter what. It is built into DocumentReference, so we should talk about it.</p>
<p>In addition, we could choose #1 or #2 or use neither and only rely on #3 to relate the files to the report.</p>
<p>My vote is #1 and #3.</p>

<p>#3 is a given, #1 is useful for the variant profile to refer to the genomics data file. It's tidy and is a nice to have a specific call out for the files (somewhat easier to discover).</p>

<p>Nothing to stop them, no. Implementers are free to use extensions where ever they want. I was just saying our guidance was planning to focus on the usage of that extension from GenomicsReport. If we feel reference the file from any/all of our Observation profiles, perhaps we should add the extension and update our guidance? Personally, I am not sure it is necessary, but what do others think?</p>

<p>I think keeping the extension only on diagnostic report is fine. If someone has a use case and uses related reference in observation, I do not think it goes beyond the intended scope of that element.  I see no harm in only talking about diagnostic report and the extension and leaving the possibility for reference in an observation as a related resource. Might be redundant but not hurtful.</p>

<p>new extension: CON - adding another potentially overlapping extension. Which could lead to confusion as to where to put information. PRO - easier to find. more specific.<br>
use supportingInfo: CON - files are potentially grouped with more clinically actionable information. PRO - not adding an other extension. have one less place to look for information.</p>
<p>Ouch, it's like a devil's triangle....but I still think the content.type (in the DocRef, not the mime type in the attatchment data type) should get a good label to make sure it is known what is in the specific docRef. </p>
<p>From current definitions you can see where it might be confusing. <br>
Related Artifact<br>
Captures citations, evidence and other supporting documentation for the observation or report</p>
<p>Supporting Information<br>
Additional information relevant to interpreting/understanding the report</p>
<p>I'm already on the books for liking specificity, a named extension would be more specific. This is almost like grouper. Philosophically who does the element serve. The systems that are really smart will be checking the linked resources in Supporting Information to do something meaningful with them. But I could see systems shoving the reference to the genetics file deep in a comment section in the EMR. OR, if they weigh the supporting information element as of high import the reference to the genetics file might be cluttering the screen when someone reviews the result. </p>
<p>Thinking outside the EMR use case. The genetics reference could be useful to some applications which need the genetics file for action.</p>

<p>This is really the only guidance in the IG I can find for SupportingInformation (which is probably bad), but given it is what we have, I still don't feel like pointing at a genomics file is appropriate given this <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/general.html#contextual-resources">guidance</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Orders can point to other sources of information used to support the analysis performed as part of genomic testing. Genomic reports can refer to this the information that was considered as part of the report - whether provided as part of the order or made available subsequently by the patient or clinicians or otherwise retrieved. The figure above shows these relationships through the extension supportingInfo, which can be to various Observations, FamilyMemberHistory records (including records that comply with Family member history for genomics analysis and RiskAssessments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can SupportingInformation pointing at DocumentReferences, but to me it is more like other documents that were used as input to the analysis, like perhaps previous lab reports or clinical notes that might inform the lab. But perhaps that view of SupportingInformation is too narrow and that is why I don't really like it?</p>

<p>Why does the extension have a context of 'element' - is it really supposed to appear <em>anywhere</em>??  My leaning is to actually use <a href="http://DiagnosticReport.media">DiagnosticReport.media</a> and ask for the definition to be broadened.  It's a similar use-case - point to a big thing managed elsewhere that we want to talk about elsewhere in the report...</p>

<p>I will admit, I have no idea. When we moved over to FSH, at some point someone added this to an extension, and then it copied/pasted to others:<br>

<p>My leaning is to actually use <a href="http://DiagnosticReport.media">DiagnosticReport.media</a> and ask for the definition to be broadened.  It's a similar use-case - point to a big thing managed elsewhere that we want to talk about elsewhere in the report...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The current definition (in R4 and R5) seems to be too narrow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A list of key images associated with this report. The images are generally created during the diagnostic process, and may be directly of the patient, or of treated specimens (i.e. slides of interest).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have made a request to broaden this definition, but until then, it feels like we would be choosing an attribute just because it has the datatype we need. That feels wrong to me.</p>

<p>Just to not lose track of this, wanted to tag a few people and see if they are OK putting this change on hold for now, and instead do this (based on Lloyd's suggestion above):</p>
<ul>
<li>wait until the definition of <a href="http://DiagnosticReport.media">DiagnosticReport.media</a>' is broadened in R5 (seems to have tentative approval from O&amp;O)</li>
<li>pre-adopt from our IG after R5 release (so, in our STU3 release)</li>
</ul>
<p>This feels like the best long term answer to me honestly, but it likely prevents getting this covered in the STU2 release. <em>Unless</em> in STU2 we make a short term change (which feels weird to me).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span>  can we get a promise from O&amp;O? Also, We could stretch the current definition if it is in line with the next version, I think, as we do not currently have a place. It would be our guidance saying to use the <a href="http://DiagnosticReport.media">DiagnosticReport.media</a> for the specific genomic data formatted files (such as CRAM, BAM, SAM, VCF...) and acknowledge that the R5 definition is being used.</p>
<p>to be honest, I think people will be happier to have a place for the files that is inline with R5 then have us stick tightly to a definition which is broadend. We do not have a specified spot for those files today, so I don't see any harm.</p>

<p>good point Kevin. However, that's what operations are for : ^ ) It would be a specific, specialized use case where someone would want the genomic data file formats on their own. By forcing context with a diagnostic report, as a devil's advocate, it ensures that the file has the context that biased the bioinformatic/variant scientist workflows used to produce the file. I think it not likely at this time that an unbiased survey of genome would be communicated. For example, with more common short-sequencing NGS pipelines can be adjusted to improve detection of repeats, and there are coverage versus quality filters that can be adjusted based on the desired regions to call. For VCF files you'll only see the regions targeted by the specific pipeline.  However (in favor of sending alone), if the specific pipeline metadata were included, as has been advocated, the context would be clarified well enough that the file by itself could be fully comprehended by the receiving system. </p>

<p>Regarding timelines, we have already balloted STU2 (in May 2021) and we are working through ballot reconciliation (resolving the issues from the ballot comments) before we can release STU2 as a standard. I believe we are trying to target end of year to complete ballot rec then start the publishing process. If we can stick to that I hope we can release STU2 by 2022 Q1.</p>

<p>Update our guidance to use <a href="http://DR.media">DR.media</a> even now, since it aligns with our long term vision, and just deal with the short comings.</p>

<p>Nope. You can't focus on R5 and R4 at the same time in this case. I revise my position. Do not give any guidance till R5, but do point folks towards Document Reference - just don't connect to for them.  If an implementer need to connect Document Reference to a specific report, they could use at least two ways (both of which would be deprecated uses and not fully compatible with R5). Rather than use guidance that get's broken just mention Document Reference (with attachment) as a way of communicating VCF, BAM and SAM location for R4. </p>
<p>But don't give an express way to connect with Diagnostic Report. It'll be a compromise, but if implementers get so far as to use Document Reference for exchanging VCF, BAM and SAM file locations (or, saint's preserve us, files), they will only need to adjust how they connect with Diagnostic Report in R5.</p>

<li>Go with an extension for now, but add to our STU note that this approach will change to <a href="http://DR.media">DR.media</a> once we upgrade our IG to R5. <ul>
<li>If extension, we need to decide between a new extension or use 'SupportingInformation' and update our proposed guidance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do not have a reference from DR to DocRef, only use (DocRef.context.related to refer to GenomicsReport) and update our proposed guidance: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/documentreference-definitions.html#DocumentReference.context.related">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/documentreference-definitions.html#DocumentReference.context.related</a></li>

<p>File Attachments<br>
This approach to file attachments needs to be carefully reviewed and considered. There are many potential issues and the Work Group welcomes feedback.</p>
<p>The Genomics File extension can be used to transmit the contents of, or links to, files that were produced as part of the testing process. Common examples are VCF, BAM, CRAM, and other similar files. Using the Genomics Document Reference profile provides the advantage of allowing a file to have its own existence and makes queries like "find all VCF files for this patient" possible by directly querying the DocumentReference resource. The extension provides an easy way to identify the file that is associated to a given report.</p>
<p>There are many considerations for these kinds of files, but one of the most recognized is file size. Many can be quite large, so size must be carefully considered. The GenomicsDocumentReference resource has different options to evaluate for your use case. The document content can be embedded directly in the resource using <a href="http://DocumentReference.content.attachment.data">DocumentReference.content.attachment.data</a>. In this case, the servers receiving the files may have size constraints per resource or per transaction which may limit your options. Alternatively, the file can be referenced by a URL using DocumentReference.content.attachment.url. The URL will likely point to an online resource that is not the FHIR server, perhaps referring directly to a cloud resource that hosts the file. In this case, servers may have constraints that limits access to resources outside the organization, which would prevent the receiving system from accessing the data. This approach also introduces authorization concerns, where the FHIR server would need to understand the authorization mechanism used to protect the file.</p>
<p>Implementers should also consider how the files were generated - what pipelines were used, what tools and applications were used in those pipelines, specific settings, and more. All of these must be carefully evaluated to ensure appropriate use of those files in downstream processes. The DocumentReference.description might be helpful for sending systems to provide some guidance on how the file was generated. However, a fully computable approach has yet to be described.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the Genomic File extension is not an appropriate way to send a copy of the report (e.g., PDF or other document containing the written report). Instead, use DiagnosticReport.presentedForm. Also note the Genomic File extension is different than the Genomics Artifact extension, which is used to reference citations, evidence and other supporting documentation for the observation or report. Another approach to avoid for attaching files is the <a href="http://DiagnosticReport.media">DiagnosticReport.media</a> attribute. Its definition focuses on "Key images associated with this report" which does not align well with this use case.</p>
<p>While a full, detailed discussion of an implementation is outside the scope of this IG, these and other factors affect how these files should be handled. In a future release, this IG may include a profile of DocumentReference or other artifacts to provide more specific guidance.</p>

<p>Here is my edit of the text.... I have a word doc with tracking on, if you would like me to attach it here.  Please not two sections which begin with "AH note".  These are sections I could not resolve. </p>
<p>In a future release, the file attachments guidance below, will be changed to utilize upcoming FHIR R5 updates to the <a href="http://DiagnosticReport.media">DiagnosticReport.media</a> backbone element. The attribute will refer to DocumentReference instead of Media, and this guidance will then be updated. This approach to file attachments needs to be carefully reviewed and considered. There are many potential issues and the Work Group welcomes feedback.</p>
<p>There are use cases in genomics where a deeper level of data than that provided by the variant profile is warranted, thus, specifications such as VCF, BAM, CRAM, and MAF have been developed. Best practices in exchanging these files along with the metadata necessary to make use of them through a FHIR API remains a complicated and open issue. See operations for a description of an experimental alternative workflow.</p>
<p>While in future versions of FHIR other resources or options might be preferred, currently, DocumentReference is a good candidate as a means to provide access to genomic data formats (AH QUESTION: We call them data formats here and specifications in paragraph above – which should we use?)  such as VCF, BAM, CRAM and MAF. As opposed to the files just mentioned: attachments which  are individually useful (such as clinical notes) would likely be  sent in FHIR using the DocumentReference resource, which allows the file and its captured metadata (e.g. within the DocumentReference.context element) to be discovered via search queries.</p>
<p>(AH NOTE: - This paragraph was originally the key point of this section, but is now a bit lost – and I can’t harmonize the earlier draft with this current draft. It DEFINITELY needs work however, as I can’t easily make sense of it …. To many references to “objects” without enough clear text providing the context) The Genomics File extension can be used to transmit the contents of, or links to, files that were produced as part of the testing process The Genomics File extension can be used to reference files from the GenomicsReport. Also provided is the Genomics Document Reference profile which provides guidance for the genomic file itself.</p>
<p>When sending genomic files there are many considerations. For example, it is not unusual for files to be gigabytes in size. The DocumentReference resource has different options to evaluate for your use case. If embedded directly using using <a href="http://DocumentReference.content.attachment.data">DocumentReference.content.attachment.data</a>, servers receiving the files may have size constraints per resource or per transaction which may limit your options. Instead of sending a large data file, the file can be referenced by a URL and title using the using DocumentReference.content.attachment.url element. This can point to an online resource that hosts the file or from where the file can be accessed. For genomic files, the host is likely not the FHIR server providing the DocumentReference data instance. Be aware that use of DocumentReference to provide access to files through URLs introduces authorization requirements that are out of scope of this Implementation Guide.</p>
<p>For receivers to make use of these files,  many facets of the generation of the genomic files will be needed, such as what pipelines, tools, and settings were used. The intended downstream use case must be carefully evaluated to ensure appropriate file preparation. The DocumentReference.description might be helpful for a sending system to provide guidance on how the file was generated. A fully computable approach for this issue has yet to be defined.<br>
It should be noted that the Genomic File extension is not an appropriate way to send a copy of the report (e.g., PDF or other document containing the written report). Instead, use DiagnosticReport.presentedForm. Also note the Genomic File extension is different than the Genomics Artifact extension, which is used to reference citations, evidence and other supporting documentation for the observation or report. In this release, another approach to avoid for attaching files is the <a href="http://DiagnosticReport.media">DiagnosticReport.media</a> attribute. Its definition focuses on "Key images associated with this report" which does not align well with this use case. However, as noted in the STU note above, this will be changing in a future release.</p>
<p>A full, detailed implementation discussion, is outside the scope of this IG. In a future release, this IG may include other profiles or artifacts along with more specific guidance.</p>

<p>I think it looks pretty darn good as it is now! Only thing we may want to add is a warning that genomic files will likely be compressed (when their url is accessed) and may have unexpected or missing mime types</p>

<p>I still am hesitant with the placement - there's a lot of text and it gives weight to the concept of including the files. It is a prominent place. Let me re-read. perhaps I just need another sentence.</p>

<p>Yeah. my problem is that attaching genomics files to me is a note about an addendum item - whereas the observations are more critical to discuss (and to be read - although one should read the entire specification...)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span>  - I tried adding Jamie's comment to this section.. see what you think: </p>
<p>When sending genomic files there are many considerations. For example, it is not unusual for files to be gigabytes in size. The DocumentReference resource has different options to evaluate for your use case. If embedded directly using using <a href="http://DocumentReference.content.attachment.data">DocumentReference.content.attachment.data</a>, servers receiving the files may have size constraints per resource or per transaction which may limit your options. Another issue to be aware of, is that these files will likely be compressed and may not have a defined mime type. </p>
<p>Then a paragraph break and continue the rest as is...</p>

<p>To me it is the subject for an end note. could we put a single sentence with a link further down the page?

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span>  maybe this will work (for including Jaime's comment): </p>
<p>Instead of sending a large data file, the file can be referenced by a URL and title using the using DocumentReference.content.attachment.url element. This can point to an online resource that hosts the file or from where the file can be accessed. For genomic files, the host is likely not the FHIR server providing the DocumentReference data instance. Be aware that that these files will likely be compressed and may not have a defined mime type. Also be aware that use of DocumentReference to provide access to files through URLs introduces authorization requirements that are out of scope of this Implementation Guide.</p>

<p>I would actually propose adding <em>this</em> to the end of 3rd paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... Be aware that use of DocumentReference to provide access to files through URLs introduces authorization requirements that are out of scope of this Implementation Guide. <em>With either of these approaches, it is important to note the files might be compressed. The mime types for these genomic files will vary, or possibly be missing.
