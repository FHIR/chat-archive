<p>Original Comment by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="249407">@Rachel Kutner</span> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Mode of Inheritance, there's a LOINC code suggested in the link I originally included, but the LOINC's answer list isn't fully inclusive of the terms we're wanting to create. Would the best approach be to submit a request to update the LOINC code to include the full list of terms we're interested in? The list is here: <a href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/GTR/standard_terms/Mode_of_inheritance.txt">https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/GTR/standard_terms/Mode_of_inheritance.txt</a><br>
Or is there some reason a new LOINC code might be warranted if we want to expand the scope?<br>
For Functional Annotation, we have a few questions. Based on the description of the term in the link, it points to a SO code which indicates Structural_Variant, which seems incorrect. <a href="http://sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001537">http://sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001537</a><br>
It possibly intended to reference the Functional Effect list here, which corresponds to our concept of "Functional Effect": <a href="http://sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001536">http://sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001536</a><br>
If it did intend to reference the Structural_Variant SO, that is what we're considering "Variant Consequence" in our own data structure: <a href="https://m.ensembl.org/info/genome/variation/prediction/predicted_data.html">https://m.ensembl.org/info/genome/variation/prediction/predicted_data.html</a><br>
Which term is intended to be referenced by "Functional Annotation"?</p>

<p>Hi all, I'm looking to see what we want to do as next steps on this. </p>
<p>We can summarize the feedback we get while developing our project (incorporating "Variant Consequence/Structural_Variant" and "Functional Annotation/Functional Effect" into our data model based) and share it with the group. </p>
<p>Are there other suggestions for how we could help move these decisions/clarifying these concepts forward?</p>

<p>Summarized feedback is a great way to start the process.</p>
<p>Ultimately we need to develop specific proposals and log trackers.  So we come up with small(ish) statements of work, like "We need to rename this component" or "We need to create a new ValueSet which constrains possible answers from SequenceOntology" or "We need to split up the Variant profile like ...." or "We need to update the LOINC code's description / answer list" or "We need to write up guidance/examples that articulate X,Y,Z" --  I will admit I was multi-tasking during the call today so perhaps I missed it, but I am not sure we have many (any?) specific proposals yet?</p>
<p>We can collaborate on developing those specific proposals here.</p>

<p>Hi all, hoping to get our Lab ask here as focused as possible after folks have had a chance to review Clinvar's glossary and dictionary. It seems the real meat here is understanding labs' workflows for attaching SO terms to variants. To that end questions I'd pose are: </p>
<ol>
<li>Do they have one or more lists of SO terms that they pick from? Are other ontologies preferred?</li>
<li>Do they follow clinvar's "Molecular Consequence" approach and separate out <strong>calculable protein product effects and location-based terms</strong> from other functional effects?</li>
<li>Do they value annotating some functional terms as "predicted" vs "observed"?</li>
</ol>
<p>What are others' thoughts here?</p>

<p>I'm not an expert, but it looks like every term under SO's "structural variant" (<a href="http://sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001537">http://sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001537</a>) may be able to be calculated explicitly from the type and location of the variant. We should confirm this and then we could push for using the larger list as it aligns with Clinvar's "Molecular Consequence."</p>
<p>However, Clinvar's guidance on the "Functional Consequence" concept is very spotty, and we need to be careful there. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194730">@Liz Amos</span> do you have any contacts related to that effort? Kevin and I uncovered some discrepancies... Additionally, their data dictionary lists several terms that are also under "structural variant" in SO, so the move to binding this concept to the sister SO term "functional_effect_variant" (<a href="http://sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001536">http://sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001536</a>) should be deliberate, if made.</p>
<p>We may need to separate out consequences not based on where they are in SO but on how they were asserted. I'm looking to the IM work to help out here, and think it should be included in our "lab ask."</p>

They narrowed down the SO list to a handful of terms and left it extensible, rather than pointing to the full list of ~244 terms, though they haven't finalized that decision yet.<br>
Of note, they have an experimental "Functional Impact Statement" listed as TODO, and a couple other similar concepts split out in the "Final Statement Model" tab. I encourage others to take a look.</p>

<p>Good reference.  So, it seems we are left with 4 options in this space (ordered I think from no work (1) to the most work(4) ):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do nothing (doesn't seem right)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the proposed change from today:<br>
add functional effect - binding: SO:functional_effect_variant<br>
add variant consequence - binding: SO:structural_variant (ensuring we have AA change type covered)<br>
remove AA change type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create new components for Molecular Consequence / Functional Consequence as closely to how ClinVar defines them today, likely still remove AA change type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pull in the pieces that make the most sense from the ga4gh_va_model in process work, acknowledging it is still a work in process, but hopefully we end up ahead of the game.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, I sort of lean toward (3).  I want to say (4), but not sure this is something HL7 should build upon - at least not yet?   Having said that, it does seem like "Molecular Consequence Statement" is close to / exactly like ClinVar's Molecular Consequence - so that is good.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194730">@Liz Amos</span>  I asked our Molecular Pathology advising committee about Functional Effect. The responses I got were that Functional Effect and Molecular Consequence are very different concepts and both need a landing zone in the spec. </p>
<p>They described the pipelines generating Functional Effect as "highly complex and context dependent", but they did say that the SO's Functional_Effect branch is the correct starting point to work off of and those values are clearly applicable to the concepts we're trying to represent - and the split in the SO makes sense. </p>
<p>I asked if the tools would output values like in the SO or a calculated score (like in the Functional Impact in GA4GH) and the response was "it depends on the discretion of the lab and the workflow in question, and the solution needs to have the ability to represent either, possibly through multiple fields available to represent Functional Effect in different ways, like they're trying to do in GA4GH with the Functional Impact &amp; Pathogenic Mechanism fields". We pretty </p>
<p>Examples of different contexts seemed to be germline vs somatic testing, disease being evaluated, methods of evaluation. The values in the Functional_Effect_Variant in the SO include values that would be applicable in both Somatic and Germline contexts, and the field would need to be structured such that it was clear which context the value is being sent in. </p>
<p>They also stated clearly that these fields should both be Variant-level concepts. </p>
<p><strong>Liz and I are working on getting an updated proposal to discuss and vote on at a future meeting - we'll update the JIRA trackers as well. </strong></p>

<p>Good stuff, thanks for the continued great info <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="249407">@Rachel Kutner</span> !  Your points about "context dependent" makes me wonder a bit - do others agree with that?</p>
<p>As we know, we don't have a great way to really indicate relationships between the different components of an Observation.  We already have quite the hodge-podge of components today, and it makes many of us uncomfortable.  This is just another one on the pile I suppose, but we should consider that.</p>
<p>Of course, we could do a new profile of Observation for Functional Effect?  We would have to ask how we make it distinct from our Implication profiles?  Or is it distinct?  We already have the "context" in our Implications.  However, this effect doesn't quite feel the same as what we put into Implication today.</p>
<p>Having said all this, it is end of day on a Friday, so I will stop there and let others jump in. <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span></p>

<p>I think adding it in the same location that "Functional Annotation" is documented here makes sense. Is this an outdated resource? I can never seem to find the right parts of the FHIR Specification when I google it. <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/variant.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/variant.html</a> </p>
<p>Note that in this case, if a Functional Effect is sent in, the Variant it is on can also have "Germline" or "Somatic" noted in a related component, which provides the needed context. </p>
<p>I also think he meant that what was being evaluated changes the values you would expect to return, how you evaluate it, and what tools you use. This was in reference to asking about the pipeline/annotation methods that result in the assignment of a particular value of Functional Effect/Significance. But the SO branch for Functional Effect has the terms that would be expected to be returned in various contexts, and that it is a highly curated expert set of values and that the organization in it makes sense to him as a pathologist. </p>
<p>He also supported this being extensible so it is able to adapt to evolution of the terms in the future.</p>

<p>We use SO terms that are generated through a program called SnpEff - you can see a table of their terms here: <a href="http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpEff_manual.html">http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpEff_manual.html</a> We use these to inform our variant naming and evidence placement, but we do not report them out directly. In fact, many of them we group together or ignore entirely if they're too broad or otherwise irrelevant for the type of testing that we do. For the SO terms that we do use, they're back-end annotations in [our homegrown report writing applications] and are not included in our report data.</p>

<p>Glad to see you  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="320284">@Tim Owen</span>  be sure to take a peek at the diagnostic and therapeutic implications too.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span>  it  has been suggested a number of times, to use a single component: 'variant-level annotation' and leave the value set to the sender. This would simplify the number of components but it makes it hard to identify the component. That being said, there is no reason someone cannot slice on component with a specific component.code Maybe we should be giving guidance on the component.codes to use for different situations as a guide. A FHIR server can handle components on its own, so the guidance to slice on component with a list of .codes would produce data that is queriable on a FHIR server.  General LOINC Codes can be useful to provide meaning.</p>
