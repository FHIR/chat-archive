<p>I just received an email from the Personalized Medicine Coalition (PMC). They were involved in the publication of the linked PDF which indicates significant Incongruities Between Drug-Gene Associations Listed in FDA’s Table of Pharmacogenetic Associations and Guidelines Published by (CPIC).  These inconsistencies have been noted before, but  this document highlights the peril of using CPIC or most other repositories as a "source of truth" when looking for gene/medication implications.  FDA has formally recognized this issue and joined a new pharmacogenomics collaborative community called Standardizing Laboratory Practices in Pharmacogenomics (STRIPE), which aims to bring diverse stakeholders together to address challenges and opportunities for PGx testing.  But in the meantime, this issue continues to plague the PGx domain <a href="/user_uploads/10155/5FVMXuzJpyvtP0xutPgvTxDq/PMC-Comparison-of-FDA-Tables-with-CPIC-Tables-Pharmacogenomics.pdf">PMC-Comparison-of-FDA-Tables-with-CPIC-Tables-Pharmacogenomics.pdf</a></p>

<p>Thanks for sharing. Otherwise, I would not have been aware of this problem.</p>
