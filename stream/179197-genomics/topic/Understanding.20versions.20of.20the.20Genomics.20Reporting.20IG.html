<p>After fielding lots of questions and seeing lots of confusions about all the different versions of the IG running around, I drafted the following guidance. I welcome feedback, and hope it helps.</p>

<p>Thank you Kevin!  This is a very valuable document you created!  I really appreciate your taking the time to do this. It helps me personally keep track of what is published where - but more importantly, we can link people to it, when they are trying to navigate various versions of our IG.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span>  Thanks for the guide regarding the IG versions! I did post a topic but thought it wasn't the right place to ask so I marked it solved (couldn't find the delete function). <br>
your guide should help clear confusions on the versions and help implementors to look at the correct version! <span aria-label="+1" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="+1">:+1:</span></p>
