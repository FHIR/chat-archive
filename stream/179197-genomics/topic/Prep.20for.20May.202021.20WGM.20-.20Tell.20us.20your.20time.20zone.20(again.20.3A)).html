<p>Hi all - We are being asked to request time slots (days and quarters) for the May 2021 WGM. The co-chairs would like to understand where our participants are from so we can find time slots that works for the most people. We had a form for this a while back, but if you could take a moment, please add your name and UTC offset to this spreadsheet:<br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> - There has been some discussion among our team - that some Working Groups are not using the times set out by HL7 for this WGM because the times are so terribly inconvenient for those in the US. is there a way that we could determine how many people outside of the US will be attending our WGM so that we can see if it makes sense to look at alternate times?</p>

<p>I will add - that perhaps the reason we don't get as much participation outside the US is because most of our scheduling is fairly US centric now <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>
