<p>From the v0.4 IG spec...</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="108">
<li><strong>Observation.component:variation-code</strong><br>
SliceName :    <strong>variation-code</strong><br>
Definition   :     <strong>This term is used to report the unique identifier of the simple variant found in this study.</strong><br>
Control      :  <strong>0..1</strong></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I assume this is a placeholder for any "unique identifier" that the producer wishes to use to identify the variant that the observation is about. If so, I'm not sure why it is constrained to only 1.  I also think the wording of the definition should be adjusted to clarify whether this is only for <em>simple variants found</em> of is it for <em>the variant that the observation is being made about</em>.  Since observations can be used to share information about variants that are "absent" or "present".  And, I assume not only simple but complex variants may be registered somewhere that have unique identifiers as well - and these presumably could be used here.</p>
<p>I would consider making this component a little more useful by allowing folks to share any identifiers or codes that they feel are unique and identifying for their purposes. Since there is no universal standard for variant codes or identifiers, this would be more of a cross-referenceable set of codes and identifiers that would help people find and understand more about the actual variant that the observation was referencing.</p>
<p>Maybe it should be renamed to variation-xref-identifiers. (or variation-xref-codes if you must) with a 0...* cardinality.<br>
The added benefit here would be that you could combine dbSNP-id component here, which many folks use to cross reference and identify variation. </p>
<p>Anyway. The basic ask is "why the 0..1 constraint" when there may be multiple identifiers that are useful to share (e.g. ClinVar variation id, ClinGen canonical allele id, GA4GH variant digest id, hgvs nomenclature, COSMIC id, gnomAD id, etc...)</p>

<p>I like the approach of having a single component for all relevant identifiers, though currently we split out dbSNP and HGVS because they are treated very differently. Systems can easily slice this component to require specific codings to be present (clinvar, COSMIC, etc). </p>
<p>I also agree the textual guidance on it is currently misleading, I believe "found" here pertains to in the study, not necessarily in the patient.</p>

<p>it is interesting that for some components, you would replicate the entire component if you want to provide multiple values, but for situations where the component value is a CodeableConcept we have to only provide one component instance with multiple codings buried in the value's CodeableConcept.  It's stuff like this that seems to slow down innovation IMO. But this is a model that is pretty well established and part of learning how to play with FHIR.</p>

<p>The distinction we <em>try</em> to make is what you said above: 'which would all be presumed to be equivalent concepts', so we keep the component as 0..1, but when the thing we are representing is not equivalent concepts, we allow the component to be 0..* (now I am hoping we don't have a mistake which shows we don't do that right all the time <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span>)</p>

<p>nesting multiple answers in a value's codeableconcepts in some cases feels right in some cases. for example, when they are truly alternative codings for the same exact thing. But when they are somewhat different, from differing authorities and not so exact, it feels like they should be separate component copies. Just saying.</p>

<p>i'm not sure a clinvar variationId is equivalent to a CIVIC variant id, which is equivalent to a gnomAD representation or id which is equivalent to a clingen allele registry id.  And if you go that far, then some would say that hgvs and dbsnp are equivalent "enough" to play in that equation.</p>

<p>I don't know much about gnomAD or the allele registry, but I would hope they are at least equivalent in terms of being 'unique identifiers for the variant' (I agree 'simple' needs to be removed). Otherwise they may be better suited elsewhere, as a different concept</p>

<p>All fair points, and ones we quibbled over for a bit.  The discussion on multiple codings  describes it like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#CodeableConcept" target="_blank" title="https://hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#CodeableConcept">https://hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#CodeableConcept</a><br>
Additional Codes</p>
<p>More than one code may be used in CodeableConcept. The concept may be coded multiple times in different code systems (or even multiple times in the same code systems, where multiple forms are possible, such as with SNOMED CT). Each coding (also referred to as a 'translation') is a representation of the concept as described above and may have slightly different granularity due to the differences in the definitions of the underlying codes. There is no meaning associated with the ordering of coding within a CodeableConcept. A typical use of CodeableConcept is to send the local code that the concept was coded with, and also one or more translations to publicly defined code systems such as LOINC or SNOMED CT. Sending local codes is useful and important for the purposes of debugging and integrity auditing.</p>

<p>I simply meant 'allele' here as 'location' (eg dbSNP). I understand the decision to pull it out of variation code--even though it may be used in some spaces as a less granular identifier, us giving it a separate component implies it should not be used as a unique identifier, which I agree with. We may even want to suggest an invariant requiring at least <code>alt-allele</code> if dbSNP is populated, from my limited experience</p>

<p>It was a discussion before I started with the group and we haven't really reviewed the component since. We may be able to put dbSNP in as a sliced coding with an invariant at that level, which may be very cool (would then have to populate data-absent-reason on alt-allele, for example) though I am unsure of how to get that into the structureDef with the spreadsheet method... ;)</p>

(<code>code=LOINC|81252-9</code>, multiple entries on <code>value[x].coding</code>) <br>
works for everyone's needs, but dbSNP and/or HGVS may be lumped into the same component in the future if there is enough call for it.</p>

<p>the dbSNP component is historical.  I think we'll be able to remove it. Clem was the strongest proponent at the time, but that was before our more recent work. My suggestion is to raise a proposal on the next call to remove it, make sure Clem and anyone else have a chance to raise objections, then cast a vote. Likely it will be deprecated in favor of putting dbSNP into variant ID.</p>

<p>I would say the one issue here is that dbSNPIds without the precise nucleotide change is somewhat ambiguous, so calling it a variation code is a bit of a stretch. Like many of the variation codes that I think folks would use this field should be more along the lines of a "cross-reference" code.  XRefs or cross-references are useful in communicating other identifiers that precisely or closely relate to the concept in question.  <br>
If you truly want a field of equivalent or precise cross-referenceable codes (or ids) to the variation in question then dbSNP should not go with variation-code.  Its a tradeoff for sure.  I can see the case for an xref-codes field so that dbSNP and any other's like it can be shared versus having a dedicated field for each type that exists out there, historical or future.</p>

<p>An invariant on dbSNP prompting alt-allele seems in order, regardless of whether the system shows up as its own component or lumped into one with others</p>

<p>I'm thinking about a use case where only hgvs is populated and the alt-allele isn't filled out. As the hgvs gives you the alt allele this should be ok to use with dbSnp</p>

<p>Thats actually a very valid point. <br>
+1 for invariant which enforces a alt allele if the system of variant id equals dbSNP</p>

<p>In my experience, when people are hooked on something, you have to get them off of the drug slowly.  In this case, have a way to support dbSNP, but make it easy to not need dnSNP going forward.</p>
