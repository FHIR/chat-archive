<p>We have been discussing our implementation of the HL7v2 Clinical Genomics implementation spec with some clinicians, and received push back on using "Associated Phenotype" to describe a disease associated with a variant that may or may not be observed on the patient. They suggested using "Disease Association" instead of "Associated Phenotype" to try and distinguish between those that are observed on the patient and those that are just associated with the result. </p>
<ol>
<li>Is this the correct interpretation for that field in the HL7 specification? </li>
<li>Is this something anyone else has heard or would support? </li>
</ol>
<p>The concern is in confusing phenotypes actually observed on a patient vs. ones that are reported as being associated with a genomic result on the patient.</p>

<p>The associated phenotypes is still defined as something associated to the genetic finding and not direct patient observations.  So perhaps this is just something we haven't defined very well (likely in both the V2 and FHIR IG work we have done recently)?  <br>
FWIW - This is the LOINC code from the FHIR IG (and I think it is the same one in the V2?)<br>
<a href="https://loinc.org/81259-4/" title="https://loinc.org/81259-4/">https://loinc.org/81259-4/</a><br>
"The possible phenotype associated with the genetic variant found in this study."</p>
<p>Having said that, I would be supportive of having this be an official request that we consider.  Anything we can to to make it easier for people to see and digest is good.  Welcome input from the community on this one.</p>

<p>I looked up what the description was in V2: "The disorder with which this variant is associated." (It was also named Probably Associated Phenotype). Perhaps that language is more clear than what is currently in the FHIR IG for General Genomic Reporting: "The 'Inherited Disease' Implication indicates the likelihood of inheritance (valueCodeableConcept) of a particular disease (the associated-phenotype) as well as how inheritance is likely to occur (mode-of-inheritance)." <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/general.html#genomic-implications" title="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/general.html#genomic-implications">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/general.html#genomic-implications</a></p>

<p>In a related thread, I was checking out the new/proposed implication profiles and was curious why we have Associated Phenotype and Associated Cancer? This is in Somatic Reporting. Could we not just use Associated Phenotype or is there a reason Associated Cancer has it's own component?</p>

<p>That's a great question! We try to not give guidance to shoehorn things into LOINC concepts that are well-defined if the other concepts are out of scope of that definition. Do you feel we could use associated-phenotype instead? The concepts are treated the same here but seem to diverge in what I've seen <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span>. </p>
<p>I am hoping we could properly define a single concept that covers both uses</p>

<p>I'm with you in spirit but I'm a bit wary of using the exact phrasing. The way I read the phenopacket spec is that PhenotypicFeature describes the characteristics associated with the subject/patient. This is kind of similar to what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="249407">@Rachel Kutner</span> was describing in her question.  I think adding the word "Associated" helps but maybe we can define it even more.</p>

<p>So, two questions here:<br>
1 - Do we combine 'associated-phenotype' and 'associated-cancer' components?<br>
2 - If we have one or two, what name(s) do we use?</p>
<p>My thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This may be naive, but honestly I am less concerned about the name we use than I am about clearly defining what we have and how it should be used.  Having said that, a clear, simple name is powerful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do think deciding if one or two components is the best place to start.  The more I think about it, I tend to lend towards having two. I think keeping a clear distinction between the sort of data being delivered is important (even if there is some potential overlap in code systems).  I also think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196553">@Jamie Jones</span> asked a good question - if we combine them, can consumers easily query by just what they are looking for, and then easily understand the difference when they get a response?

</ul>
<p>Before we talk about the final definition/usage guidance/name, I will stop there and see what others think of one or two.</p>

<p>sorry not able to be on zulip much at the moment. I suggest to change the name of associated phenotype to be specific  - but clinicians will never see it as a user of the data. The names are/should only be visible in the backend. However, 'risk-of' might be clearer. Regards Cancer component and codes , there's ICD-O-3 and SNOMEDCT to consider. Locking down to a code set will be tricky, but no more tricky than systems already have to deal with when it comes to terminology. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="249407">@Rachel Kutner</span>  could you perhaps use a different display in your UI? can your system accommodate that?

<p>Right now the semantics of two elements gives us the opportunity to explicitly state that the observation components are specific to a cancer. We could switch to a flag, I guess. If we use one field then one would need to know ahead of time the code system and codes of interest for oncology...</p>

<p>just taking a look at the implications of losing the Cancer specific call out. Losing the specific oncology call-out would mean that to find oncology related genomics one would 1) start with the tumor specimen and look for all genetic reports where the tumor is the specimen (not so bad conceptually), or 2) need to know all the codesystems and codes that one would need to search in the 'field relating connection with a disease or symptom and the genetic finding'</p>

<p>sorry not able to be on zulip much at the moment. I suggest to change the name of associated phenotype to be specific  - but clinicians will never see it as a user of the data. The names are/should only be visible in the backend. However, 'risk-of' might be clearer. Regards Cancer component and codes , there's ICD-O-3 and SNOMEDCT to consider.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span>  Yes, we definitely can change the display name for this field. I wanted to make sure I interpreted the field correctly and see if there is a clinical consensus for a term that can be used with less confusion for clinicians on the front end.</p>
<p>I was hoping this work group would be able to suggest some possible alternatives which we could explore with clinicians to find a clearer, more specific alternative. Additionally, if a field is introduced in the future that is supposed to encompass phenotypes that have been reported on a patient and is associated with a result or finding, I'd like to make sure we don't choose a term that could be confusing between the two.</p>

<p>back to brainstorming: single filed for a phenotype linked either through causation or risk link, is consistent with VICC. I think the crux is defining the relationship of the condition/disease with the variant and the rest of the statement being made with the profile. for example, with the theraputic implication is the  variant 'known to cause' or 'related to risk of'</p>

<p>Is Associated Cancer a diagnostic field for somatic samples, or is it a field that is meeting the same concept as Associated Phenotype to specify a germline risk for the specified cancers?</p>
<p>If the purpose is to provide a diagnostic field for somatic samples, that sounds like a clearer case for differentiation since one indicates confident diagnostic assertion of a phenotype, the other indicates risk of a phenotype that the patient may or may not already exhibit.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="249407">@Rachel Kutner</span>  - We talked about this (sort of) in the FHIR subgroup today. The short answer is that we need to figure out an appropriate way to distinguish between 'risk of' and 'context of' when it comes to imlications.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span> logged the following tracker -  <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-26945" title="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-26945">J#26945</a> which I think gets to the heart of your question?</p>
