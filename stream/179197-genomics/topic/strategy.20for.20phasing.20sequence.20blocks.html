<p>I've been thinking of how to group sequences into phased sets and am looking at  Observation.related for this. Here's a diagram to illustrate what I'm thinking. Does this seem reasonable?<br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191490">@Gaston Fiore</span>  Observation/Sequence indicates either in the Observation for Genetics profile which can point to Sequence, or preferably in the Sequence resource itself. Right now the Observation.related.target can only point to either another Observation (or presumably a profile of Observation) or QuestionaireResponse so it can't point to Sequence directly. We'll have to suggest it for it to be another option.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> Yes. Three ways for it be inferred. 1) direct physical determination, e.g., clonal amplification/single molecule sequencing/long reads, 2) imputed using allele/haplotype frequencies, and 3) family history</p>

<p>That makes sense, but when you have optional nesting like that, it makes implementation more difficult.  That isn't a reason not to do it.  Just want to make sure we understand the requirements and/or what will we miss out on if we don't represent phasing.  I just haven't seen many examples from our clients where they report or send phasing information.  But maybe that's because there isn't a good way to do so today. :)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> Yes, it would make implementation more complicated.  At NMDP, we ask our labs to send us phasing information if they have it. Another way to do it is to add a phaseset element to the sequence resource or observation for genetics profile and use a unique label (e.g., uuid) to tag those sequences that are in phase with each other. Just need to make sure they aren't used outside of the lab result.</p>

<p>The nice thing about grouping the sequences to phase sets is it simplifies reporting the allele assignments for genotyping. e.g., for HLA-A, one phase set could represent one allele name assignment (e.g. HLA-A*01:02), and another phase set would represent the other (e.g., HLA-A*01:03), and the final genotype would be reported at the observation where both are included (e.g., HLA-A*01:02 + HLA-A*01:03)</p>

<p>but you may be able to get the same thing using phaseset element with a unique tag. I'll have to mock up some examples of both ways.</p>

<p>For HLA interpretation, for example, it's generally useful to know which exon 2 and exon 3 go together (have the same phase).  Information about phase may also be useful for other scenarios involving exomic data.</p>
<p>In terms of the SO, I'm not sure whether we're talking about a representation for a sequence_collection (<a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001260" target="_blank" title="http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001260">SO:0001260</a>), or maybe a sequence_assembly (<a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/miso/current_svn/term/SO:0000353" target="_blank" title="http://www.sequenceontology.org/miso/current_svn/term/SO:0000353">SO:0000353</a>).</p>

<p>The most relevant reference I'm seeing is consensus-sequence-block, described in the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2015.08.001" target="_blank" title="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2015.08.001">HML manuscript</a>.</p>
<p>In that case, the consensus-sequence-block is an interpretation of the primary sequence data, and phase-set is acting like a shorthand for some (presumably omitted) sequence data which was used to resolve phase.</p>

<p>Yes, when we developed HML, we used the phase-set attribute of consensus-sequence-block to tag sequences that are in chromosomal phase with each other. We can do something similar in the Sequence resource or Observation for Genetics and/or group them with Observation.related as well.</p>

<p>For others listening - would be curious if the need to represent phasing is important for non-HLA use cases?  Meaning, could this be part of one of the HLA specific profiles?  I get the sense it is good to represent, but like to see the use cases to support it.  Or maybe the best question here - Is representing phase part of the 80% or the 20%?</p>

<p>Yes, the Consensus-sequence-block profile of Sequence was created for the HLA use case, and includes phaseSet. We can use that. But if it can be used for other use cases, it could be elevated to the Sequence resource, or included in the Observation for Genetics Profile.</p>

<p>I was thinking along the lines of how resources in bundles are identified, using the Bundle.entry.fullUrl element which is a uri data type (<a href="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/datatypes.html#uri" target="_blank" title="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/datatypes.html#uri">http://hl7-fhir.github.io/datatypes.html#uri</a>).

urn:uuid:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx (using a unique uuid for each phase-set).</p>
