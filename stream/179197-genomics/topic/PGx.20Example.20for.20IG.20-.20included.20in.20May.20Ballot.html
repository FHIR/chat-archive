<p>As we discussed on today's call, I will be "taking the lead" on an effort to develop a "user friendly" guide for creating a PGx report using our IG (hopefully the first of others to come)   - here is the initial document: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12QOAuQ7-tHRkGu3JASlss6iT4Qbk4u6lhu7KaqOuMoE/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/12QOAuQ7-tHRkGu3JASlss6iT4Qbk4u6lhu7KaqOuMoE/edit?usp=sharing</a>   I mentioned today the question of including or not including an overview of ordering the report and that is but many of the questions we will need to answer as we develop this guidance (which will become a page in  our IG). Please use this Zulip thread to ask questions of the WG or me, put forward ideas, etc..  thank you!!</p>

<p>I presented the slides over two WG meetings about a year ago as part of our WG moving to he current implication profiles. Will take a look at your documentation. I briefly went through it and found the figures expansive but very informative. The document targets a comprehensive view - really stands alone from the IG as a 'Walkthrough of the HL7 CG FHIR IG through the PGx lens' I think it would be a good Tab #2. Leaving the current sections in the IG as they are (or moving them to the relevant Structure definition pages).  This would mean that the document can be super comprehensive - taking on as much scope as possible - even a little on oncology versus germline medication recommendations. What do you think?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span> - thanks for the context. Regarding the placement of the PGx "User Guide".. I would like to get input from members of the working group. <br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> ,  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196553">@Jamie Jones</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196626">@Mullai Murugan</span>  - can we be sure to get this item onto a Tuesday meeting agenda or follow-up in some other way that you feel is best? My specific concerns are that we don't make this "guide" hard to find and that we don't confuse the folks using the IG by having some information about PGx reporting as we currently have here:  <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/pharmacogenomics.html">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/pharmacogenomics.html</a>  while also showing this  info in-depth in the "User Guide" . Of course we do want the IG to have all of the resources used in PGx reports, explained in detail, either in this "User Guide" or within the IG in general.  As to including Oncology - I personally don't believe we should do that unless we have time to thoroughly explore and document the use case within the "User Guide". We won't have time to do so for this version of the "Guide" which will be part of our Ballot in May, however we could go back to it in the future and add that use case.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196476">@Arthur Hermann</span> - My thinking is that your "User Guide" should replace the pharmacogenomics page we have today. I think having two similar pages would cause confusion, so I hope you can incorporate its contents into your user guide.  What do you think?</p>
<p>Definitely no plans to do this for Oncology for the May ballot, unless someone is willing to volunteer asap?</p>

<p>A reminder to all that the PGx Report "User Guide" must be completed within the next week! I ask that everyone please read through it (note that the code and snippets still need to be added, but all other content is complete, pending input from the Working Group). My request is that you: </p>
<ol>
<li>Read through the entire document as if you were trying to create a PGx report. Does it flow well, make sense, provide the necessary information? </li>
<li>Read all comments. There are a few items that need additional information, but I am not able to provide it. I need someone from the WG to assist. </li>
<li>We need to determine if the table at the end of document should remain, and if so, what columns it should contain. I personally feel it is helpful. However, if it remains, I need folks to provide examples for that field and any other text which is required for additional columns.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you all in advance for your help in making this a useful example of how to use our IG!
