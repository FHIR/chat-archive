<p>I have been speaking with some folks from Foundation Medicine and it appears that they would like to have someone participate n theConnectathon in January. Did we intend to have anyone from our group assisting during that conConnectathon? Are there any other participants using the Genomics IG that we know of?  Should I suggest that they wait for a later Connectathon or would someone be able to work with them if they decide to participate?</p>

<p>Knowing they have an interest, we can put more of a priority on having a track in May.</p>

<p>Thank you for the update <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> . I didn't know that this decision will be made. I will circle back with them and let them know. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="249407">@Rachel Kutner</span> , I didn't ask exactly what they wanted to work on. I first wanted to confirm that we were participating. Is there a specific reason for your inquiry?</p>

<li>Receiving Orders via HL7v2</li>
<li>Sending Genomic Results via HL7v2<br>
or something else during the Connectathon.</li>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="249407">@Rachel Kutner</span>  - I didn't discuss details with them about the Connectathon, because I first wanted to ensure we were participating, but I know that they are interested in FHIR and this would include receiving orders via FHIR and sending Genomic Results via FHIR.</p>
