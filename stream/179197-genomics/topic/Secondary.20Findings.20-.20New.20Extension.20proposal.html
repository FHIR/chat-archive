<p>We didn't feel qualified to decide if it should apply to a general Observation, so decided to scope it down to our use case.  </p>
<p>RE: Cardinality - It is possible labs might want to reference their own definitions of what makes a 'secondary findings', or we might have other bodies (like European Society of Human Genetics <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3660957/" target="_blank" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3660957/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3660957/</a>) who publish their own guidelines.  In either case, it is possible a variant might be shared due to more than one policy / guideline.</p>

<p>My only concern is that is that a single CodeableConcept/multiple coding setup implies the codings are really the same concept, just from different termonolgies. That may not be the case here - as the different policies/guidelines referenced might be defined differently?  Not sure when (or if) that will become an issue.</p>

<p>It doesn't imply that they're the same concept, it implies that they're all encodings of the same concept.  The granularity/expressiveness could be different, but they're all describing the "whole" concept at some level of granularity.  So "dog", "miniature poodle", "mammal" would all be valid codings for my dog and could all be codings within the same codeable concept.  However, "black", "furry" and "high-strung" would not be appropriate codings within a single CodeableConcept because they aren't all trying to represent the same concept - they're describing different aspects.</p>

<p>OK - The 'secondary-finding' as proposed is VERY genomics specific, which is why in the google doc I suggested tying it to one of the CG profiles in our IG. I don't really have a problem with it being on a core extension, but I don't feel it will be very broadly applicable as proposed today.</p>

<p>ACMG refers to "secondary findings", hence why I chose the name.  And I really like the classification called out in page 3 of this document and the it's distinction of "incidental" versus "secondary": <a href="https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcsbi/sites/default/files/Clinician%20Primer%20Incidental%20Findings%2010.30.16.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcsbi/sites/default/files/Clinician%20Primer%20Incidental%20Findings%2010.30.16.pdf">https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcsbi/sites/default/files/Clinician%20Primer%20Incidental%20Findings%2010.30.16.pdf</a><br>
So if there is a mismtach now, how do we best resolve it?  Move the extension to one of our profiles (my preference)?  Broaden the definition and leave it where it is?  Other?</p>

<p>The extension as currently defined is focused on genetics - so if we want to broaden the definiiton, we will certainly have to re-work the current proposal.  For genetics, it is important to have the ability to indicate the "why" behind this result being delivered - as in, this variant is related to the ACMG guidelines.</p>

<p>Im trying to ask that we not do this in a genomics specific way...  the result would then be special extensions for all other modalities (blood work secondary findings, x-ray secondary findings, ecg secondary findings, etc...), and that would not be helpful overall.

<p>I think it's not clear if we're all thinking of the same thing when we talk about "secondary findings" (even when it's specific to the laboratory reporting context).  It seems that there wasn't sufficient clarity and agreement to be able to move forward with this as a core Observation element, so my suggestion was to agree to add the genetics-specific extension as proposed in the Google doc.  We can then get experience with this and if it seems that the need is actually more general then we can consider broadening it and adding it to core in a future release.  I don't quite agree with Lloyd's characterization that OO "seemed to feel that all other secondary findings were handled as reflex tests".  That's definitely not the case, but the issue was rather around what is and isn't a "secondary finding", as I mentioned before, and what the implications would be of a lab labeling a "result" as a "secondary finding" (i.e. what are the expectations around how and how much the clinician needs to consider the finding in the care of the patient).  The extension for genomics is a way to move this forward and gain experience.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span> Between a genomics-specific extension, and making it a core element, we have the option of a core extension.</p>
<p>As John says, secondary/incidental findings are common in Radiology. (Yup, patient cracked a vertebrae, and oh, by the way, there's a nodule on the lung you might want to follow up on.) My initial thoughts are yes, this would be useful to be able to record. I'm not sure if recording it in the observation or on the report is correct, i.e. a particular observation is/isn't incidental vs. these are the primary findings and these are the secondary. Is there value in knowing an observation is incidental when referenced on its own, or in the absence of having a report; or does it only become meaningful in the context of a report? I expect there is value knowing it independent of a report, but don't immediately have a use case.</p>
<p>I would suggest we make this a core extension on observation, and see how the community reacts. I'm not sure about unsolicited vs. incidental vs. secondary terminology. And we should be clear about interpretation when absent.</p>

<p>What I was thinking (but probably didn't actually say) was a standard (core) extension that addresses the genomics use case.  If it's straightforward enough for it to include other use cases as well, then I'm fine with that.  But getting back to Kevin's comment that "if we want to broaden the definition, we will certainly have to re-work the current proposal", we would have to decide how much re-work is needed and is reasonable (my thought was to keep it fairly minimal).  I think the standard (core) extension is the right place to do it.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> Are you creating the extension (we didn't discuss that in OO)?</p>

<p>Hi Kevin &amp; all,<br>
maybe i miss-understood the google document but here are my thoughts:<br>
A secondary finding is a general abstract concept independent of CG.<br>
In the Google Doc, there are ValueSet Bindings to ACMG SF; these itself are using  MIM disorder numbers.<br>
My, maybe to trivial approach would be to have a core extension which contains a fixed code or a bound valueSet to express the fact that this observation is a secondary finding. What kind of secondary finding (e.g. BREAST-OVARIAN CANCER, FAMILIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1; BROVCA1 )  should be part of the observation itself.</p>

<p>Therefore i currently can't see the benefit of binding to ACMG-SF-V1</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ACMG refers to "secondary findings", hence why I chose the name.  And I really like the classification called out in page 3 of this document and the it's distinction of "incidental" versus "secondary": <a href="https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcsbi/sites/default/files/Clinician%20Primer%20Incidental%20Findings%2010.30.16.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcsbi/sites/default/files/Clinician%20Primer%20Incidental%20Findings%2010.30.16.pdf">https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcsbi/sites/default/files/Clinician%20Primer%20Incidental%20Findings%2010.30.16.pdf</a></p>

<p>These codes on page3 would be the correct binding for the extension (in the CG domain)</p>

<p>yes, for completeness we could add Primary Finding as well. Maybe other domains also have their "special codes" for SF and would add them.<br>
In the end we would have a ValueSet with all needed code to express different kinds of "secondary findings"</p>

<p>I like those definitions, but not the examples -- I'd much rather have four examples on the same test. <br>
Do we really want to the ability for sites to extend this list? A fixed list would simplify processing. An implementation could always put an extension on this extension if they want to categorize "secondary" further. Or we add an optional element for a more specific code, but have one element that only has (primary, secondary, incidental: anticipatable, incidental: unanticipatable). <br>
Although, having just argued for a fixed list, I'd suggest we make the values heirarchical, and add one more:</p>
<ul>
<li>primary</li>
<li>secondary</li>
<li>incidental<ul>
<li>incidental: anticipatable</li>
<li>incidental: unanticipatable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>That list seems reasonable to me.  I don't have a preference in flat versus heirarchical.  I think as long as we (CG) can add an extension to the extension to further categorize Secondary, we should be covered.</p>

<p>Hierarchy allows you to sy "incidental" without commenting on whether it's anticipatable or not</p>
