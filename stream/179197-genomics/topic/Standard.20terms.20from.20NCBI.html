<p>The reason Molecular Consequence was tricky to find was that it actually is part of the GTR (Genetic Test Registry) list of standard terms: <a href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/GTR/standard_terms/Molecular_consequence.txt">https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/GTR/standard_terms/Molecular_consequence.txt</a>.

<p>Yea, looks like the GTR list is not the same as the list defined in ClinVar?  And other than the advanced search trick to see the list, I haven't found anything else in ClinVar that shows what they use?  I did see a note where they say they compute this molecular consequence, so maybe they don't provide a nice human consumable list of values.</p>

<p>ClinVar also allows free text responses, so I would imagine there are some that aren't the same as the "standard" list. Also, I would say it's a starting list (but you can see how many records are in ClinVar with the associated term by using the advanced search). Do we have to be exhaustive in the list of answers? Why not have examples with the option to use any SO code?</p>

<p>OK, are we confusing ClinVar's 'Functional consequence' (seems to come from the submitter) and 'Molecular consequence' (is computed by ClinVar)?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/docs/glossary/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/docs/glossary/</a> (Search for 'Functional consequence')<br>
Functional consequence is an observed effect of a sequence change on function. Ontologies such as VariO and Sequence Ontology (SO) are used to standardize terms, which are documented here: <a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/GTR/standard_terms/functional_consequence.txt">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/GTR/standard_terms/functional_consequence.txt</a>. As used by NCBI's resources, functional consequence is experimentally determined, in contrast to molecular consequence, which is computed from sequence annotation.</p>
<p>EDIT - I did find in the ClinVar Data Dictionary that it might be possible for a submitter to submit a Molecular Consequence, because there is the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Molecular consequence is reported fromSequence Ontology terms, and, <strong>when possible, are computed per transcript by NCBI</strong>. These terms are in this group because they can be calculated explicitly from the type and location of the variation, unlike the functional consequence which must be established experimentally (or predicted).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So perhaps if ClinVar can't compute it, they can take it from a submitter.  Looks like it is not included in the spreadsheet, but the field is included in the XML.</p>

<p>If everyone else is OK with that approach, that is fine with me as well.  Since we would likely want to turn these into official LOINC codes, is there enough info in ClinVar/GTR for LOINC to create codes for Molecular Consequence and Functional Consequence <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194730">@Liz Amos</span> ? I don't think we have completely decided we want that yet, but would be good to know if there is enough.</p>

<p>I've contacted several labs we work with and asked if they would like to join our meeting on the 22nd to discuss Molecular Consequence vs Variant Consequence and how to represent these in the spec. So far LabCorp has expressed interest, and I'm reaching out to several other labs we've worked with in the past to ask if they'll join. </p>
<p>Can we add this to the agenda for the 22nd and I can forward the meeting invite to those labs who are able to join?</p>

<p>I thought I remembered going in depth on this most recently during the FHIR WG call while we were reviewing Jira trackers, and since that's where (unless I'm confused) I was asked about bringing some clinical representatives in for clarification, that's the meeting I invited them to.</p>
<p>To be honest, I've been a little confused about the distinction between the two meetings, as it seems one can act as a bit of a follow-up to the other. Is there a distinction about what should be discussed in the meetings?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="249407">@Rachel Kutner</span> / <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196476">@Arthur Hermann</span> - Regarding the meetings (FHIR subgroup on Monday, full workgroup call on Tuesday).  Monday will always be FHIR specific topics.  Tuesday can be any topic of interest to the workgroup that relates to any of the products we own or contribute too (V2, DAM, IM, etc ...).  For the last 2 years or so, our group has had a focus on our FHIR implementation guide, so the large majority of our Tuesday calls have also had a focus on FHIR related topics.  Hence my comment above, this topic is fine for either of the calls.</p>

<p>I think our goal was to build out this document with a combination of what we have now for various components, and how they align or don't align with.  <br>

<p>I might add for <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="249407">@Rachel Kutner</span> / <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196476">@Arthur Hermann</span> -- The quote from Arthur's contact above isn't quite right, but it is close.  Maybe rather than taking what would likely turn into the entire meeting of us us trying to explain the full history of how we got to where we are, would it be easier to just have them take a few minutes and tell us how they do it?  They may not want to do this, but given the confusion of what we have now inside our group, I am concerned that us presenting to them won't make for a productive conversation?</p>

<p>I agree - My initial thinking we could simply show the lists of the terms contained in the two SO I initially suggest in the Jira tracker, and ask how (if at all) these kind of data are resulted by their lab, what term(s) they use to refer to them, and how the values they result for them are determined (where they exist). And ask for definitions of the fields they DO use to result this kind of information. </p>
<p>Then raise the question of whether there's a singular source of truth we could use to base these being represented in the FHIR spec.</p>

<li>Get an idea how important these concepts are to lab's resulting</li>
<li>Understand how extensively the terms in the SO are applied (they're very specific and likely more granular than results require) and whether they fully overlap with what the lab uses to result (if applicable)</li>
<li>Ask for definitions from each lab - what these concepts mean in context of genomic resulting (if applicable)</li>
<li>Ask if the ClinVar definitions/concepts sufficiently represent these fields/terms as the labs result them. If not, discuss why. </li>

<p>These data are usually consumed later in the workflow and not explicitly represented in reports. In your second link: </p>
<p>"Based on extensive clinical evidence, <strong>ERBB2 amplification or activating mutation</strong> may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting HER2, including antibodies such as trastuzumab," </p>
<p>the "amplification" and "activating mutation" concepts are precisely what we are trying to encode.</p>

<p>It might be more interesting to see if any of the reports contain terms like we ClinVar has for those two attributes?  I would say it is unlikely they would label the terms that way.  However, I think if we were to send the labs the ClinVar definitions (such as they are) and some of the example answers, they should be able to tell us if they deliver that sort of information.</p>

<p>Molecular and functional consequence is critical in the result interpretation. Standardization is another matter that is nice to have from the clinician standpoint, but I would think whatever labs use can be slotted in to that field so not mission critical for it to be the same nomenclature / source / formatting.</p>

<p>I just wanted to be clear that the geneticist at KP added the MOLECULAR or FUNCTIONAL words to the report section he quoted... again this is in the background work done by the lab to determine the information they provide. It is not part of the report itself.   </p>
<p>I also got a reply from my contact at Invitae - this is what he said: <br>
"Please see below - it looks we use these, but they won't appear in our report data. </p>
<p>(How) Do you use ontological terms in your workflow for variant annotation (Such as Molecular Consequence and Functional Consequence per below)?<br>
Do you use Clinvar and/or Sequence Ontology? Do you need to use Clinvar (or other) labels in your reporting? </p>
<p>We use Molecular Consequence Sequence Ontology (SO) terms to calculate our variant names and to aid in variant interpretation, but they are not directly used or displayed in the report data. When experimental data is available in the literature then we will also take the Functional Consequence of the variant into consideration for variant interpretation. This is captured through Sherloc evidence codes (PMID: 28492532).
