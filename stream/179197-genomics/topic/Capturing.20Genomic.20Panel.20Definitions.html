<p>As just discussed, we have the need to save the ordered AND the actual conducted Genomics Panel as the labs we are working with just transmit positive results. One way would to add all genes in ServiceRequest.orderDetail , but that would only represent what was ordered. The actual conducted panel could be a different one.<br>
I can't see a way to do this currently, but maybe i'm missing something.<br>
Data needed here would be: PanelName &amp; List of Genes which were looked at.</p>

<p>I think in many scenarios, the ServiceRequest will be defined as a specific panel of genes (one to many) that will be analyzed by the lab.<br>
In cases like Whole Exome or Whole Genome tests, should the ServiceRequest have a way to define the genes, or would it make more sense for something like 'phenotype codes' like in HPO?  I think it depends on who we feel is the most equipped to determine the appropriate set of genes based on the phenotype?  I don't have the answer, but wanted to ask the question?</p>

<p>A coded form of what was looked at seems reasonable. If we use a CodeableConcept (0..*) the user/implementer can choose for his usecase wether he wants GENEs or phenotype codes.</p>

<p>So we could put "what was ordered" into ServiceRequest.orderDetail. But this doesn't solve the "what was looked at" problem. This can be different than the order. For this we need another List with coded things, referenced from the Diagnostic Report</p>

<p>The other consideration beyond "where did I look for variants?" is "what types of variants was I looking for?"  If you were using a chip that only matches certain things, or even if you got good reads on the entire sequence but ignored anything that wasn't listed as a potential pharmacogenomic impact for drug X, that'll influence how we report</p>

<p>While I favor numeric ranges (in part because they can be arbitrarily granular and because from them you can derive genes, exons,etc), they also require consideration of build and coordinate system used. If we were to, say, just list genes studied, I don't know how we'd represent something like 'Gene X was studied, but exon 5 is uncallable'. I would support enabling multiple methods - range, genes, narrative description, etc.</p>

<p>Tough. You all have noted methodology dictates the granularity  possible. However, If we provide a means for all the various types (e.g. numeric, list of genes, etc....) then a Clinical system can tell a vendor that they want a particular format and  how to send it. </p>
<p>The conversation between vendor and EMR, or EMR to EMR is one that is negotiated in practice. A lab certainly has the capability to populate a well described region studied from a NGS test, or even a microarray probe set, however they are unlikely to expose the information unless a consumer requests it. The other mechanism which would dictate exposure is governmental regulation.  Because of the state of genomic reporting, we live in a world of desperate ambiguity. One must assume nothing and order tests that are duplicate studies (applies to patient genome, tumors are a different story). It becomes a matter of informing clinical practice and nudging clinical practice to a new state. I think the best we can do to is provide a means for the more granular style of reporting to be possible.</p>
<p>related aside - a ClinVar ID is based on a machine readable numeric location (available through and API call). A VCF file has a machine readable numeric location. A Bed file has a machine readable numeric location. Microarrays have machine readable numeric locations associated with their probe set (the array is manufactured with specific genomic locations in mind). FISH uses probes similarly to Microarrays.  Sanger sequencing heavily relies upon known genomic location (primers). MassArrays and PCR are similar to Sanger sequencing. Thus, I am left with the statement:</p>
<p>Machine readable numeric locations are consistently involved in genetic testing except within a lab's report on findings (Machine readable numeric: reference, position in reference).</p>
<p>So, my vote is unfortunately for all variations of 'location interrogated' to be available.</p>

<p>I would suggest to define the lab panel by the manufacturers kit ID number, most labs use commercially available panels or customize their panels. This ID would provide all the probes and genomic targets of this specific panel. It would be defined by genomic coordinates i.e. in bed file format. The genomic coordinates can be queried to investigate what genes, transcripts, regions are assayed.</p>

<p>I don't think device is the right category. in my mind it's an assay type category.  </p>
<p>An instrument (device) is capable of producing multiple assay types i.e. the illumina sequencers depending on the assay design can produce data type that would be for NGS  panel, whole exome, or whole genome. The manufacturer usually provides a target design file for commercially available assays.</p>
<p>the library designs change so labs mask the gene regions for purposes of different target panels. i.e. neurodevelopmental panel and metabolism panels would be on the same assay design. There will be a second type that defiened which panel was ordered or analyzed </p>
<p>fun fact: did you know that the FASTQ data from Illumina contains an illumina sequence identifier i.e. a unique instrument name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Illumina_sequence_identifiers" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Illumina_sequence_identifiers">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Illumina_sequence_identifiers</a><br>
perhaps there is a list of all the sequencers from (e.g. Illumina) also there is information about which run and which flow cell was used. I thought that might be useful information to have.</p>

<p>I am not sure there is a better FHIR resource to match this today:<br>
<a href="http://build.fhir.org/resourcelist.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/resourcelist.html">http://build.fhir.org/resourcelist.html</a><br>
That is not to say we couldn't propose a new "Assay" resource, but we should always compare our requirements to existing resources first.  I think the intention of Device is to be more broadly interpreted than you might imagine.  Certainly the instrument itself would be a device.  It could be an Assay becomes a profile of Device?</p>
<p>RE: your fun fact - We try to remain as platform independent as possible when it comes defining our model.   However, the Device resource contains UDI attributes if that applies.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> "It could be an Assay becomes a profile of Device?" I am thinking the configuration of the assay (test) would include <strong>genomic targets</strong> and the query would evaluate if there is <strong>intersection</strong> of the question with the target intervals assuming the target regions have <strong>acceptable</strong> range coverage by the labs standards. There would be regions that labs would deem <strong>"validated"</strong> that the query would check as well. There are always areas that can not be covered with one assay in the range 1-5%</p>

<p>To support the type of use case you describe, we have a way to represent a variant, and it can include the reference+start+end position details.  So today, you could query with a range, and get back variants that were found in that range.  However, we don't yet support telling someone that they might have asked for a region we haven't tested, or perhaps only a portion of the requested range was tested.  So ultimately that is what we are trying to work into the model.  As we define a standard way to represent the regions, we can then layer on things like quality.</p>
<p>(Note - FHIR has a way to specify search parameters that implementers should handle, so we would want to make sure we cover the "search by range" parameters)</p>

<p>I think the most important thing at this point is to define how the genomic targets can and should be defined.  In the V2 world, we defined the following:</p>
<p>Genes Studies [0..*]<br>
Gene Mutations Tested For [0..*]<br>
Ranges of DNA sequence examined [0..*] (numeric ranges)<br>
Description of ranges of DNA sequences examined [0..1] (narrative)</p>
<p>In earlier discussions on the topic, it seems there is an unfortunate need to support all of those as options, due to the variety of ways labs choose to communicate the data, and how receiving systems will be able to process the data.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196623">@Ammar Husami</span>  - Since you joined later, do you see any other ways that we should consider?</p>

<p>So, to keep this conversation going - We have basically two proposals on the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profile Observation (Regions-Studied) with components[] to define what was tested</li>
<li>Profile Device (Genetics-Assay) with extensions to define what was tested</li>
</ul>
<p>Reactions?  Preferences?  I lean towards profiling Observation.</p>

<p>1. Create a new Observation profile, 'Region-Studied', hanging off GeneticsDiagnosticReport. [0..*]</p>

<p>That isn't going to tell you what's needed.  When you're querying the list of Observations for a patient, you want to know "is there something in this space?" and to get back an answer of "yes, we looked in this space and we found X and Y" or "we looked in this space and found nothing" or "there are no observations for that region".

<p>I was looking at this similar to what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span>  is saying.

It's the actual coverage where I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> your comments may be more applicable, and where "what was found" and "what was the quality in those regions" becomes relevant.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  I'm not sure I'm following what you're suggesting. Where I'd really like to go is to have annotated regions (I'm talking about the actual coverage, as opposed to the intended coverage now). Annotations can be down to base-pair resolution, and primarily need to indicate if a region was covered or not, and whether or not it had sufficient quality. Like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span>  says, I see a two step process - I want to know about, say, TPMT variants. First, I need to know what regions of the gene were (sufficiently) covered. From there, I can query for computable genetic findings that are within my region of interest.</p>

<p>I think we are conflating quality with variants. The region-studied (for actual coverage, as opposed to intended coverage) is a first order observation - it can be used to tell us about what was read and the quality / analytic accuracy of reads in a region. There may or may not be variants in readable regions, but that's not the point. The observation is primarily telling us which regions were adequately read. To Lloyd's point, it's not so much an observation as to what was found there, but rather, an observation of whether we think things were findable there.</p>

<p>Having an Observation that says "I was able to look at this region with sufficient robustness that results could be determined" is sort of the same as "I was able to get the child to cooperate such that I was able to get the cuff on and take a good-quality blood pressure reading".  I mean, yes that's important, but that alone isn't very useful.  It's really a qualifier on the value read.  "I found this, but the result has uncertainty because the quality of the reading wasn't great" or "I didn't find anything and the quality of the reading was excellent, so there's a high certainty nothing is there".</p>

<p>Having panels is fine - they're ways of organizing related information.  But none of the descriptive information about the panel conducts into each of the leaf level observations - the patient, the specimen, the gene, the device, the quality, etc. all needs to be declared explicitly on every single observation.</p>

<p>Sorry Lloyd, but still not sure I'm following you. How would you represent "I didn't find anything and the quality of the reading was excellent, so there's a high certainty nothing is there"?

<p>A panel is just a grouper.  It organizes information but doesn't actually convey any of that information.  So all you can ever get out of such an observation is "A complete blood count was done on Patient X on date Y".  The full details are in the observations that are referenced by the panel.  If you deleted the panel Observation, you wouldn't have lost any detail about the individual leaf-level observations because they each contain the full context of who did them, when, etc. - including things like whether there was fasting before hand or anything like that.</p>

<p>Lloyd, I don't think that works here because you'll have to create a ton of observations only to say that nothing was found. Also, I don't think that addresses the scenario where you just care about the readability of a region, and didn't actually look for variants.<br>
If anything, I would see a relationship between region-studied and computable genetic findings.</p>

<p>That helps me some - but still not clear on the implications.  Again, simple example - my test sequenced all of CYP2C9 and I found two variants - how many observations is that?  How does that align with DescribedVariant profile, where we currently would define the two variants found?</p>

<p>Why would you care about the readability of a region if you didn't look for anything?  I agree it may mean a large number of Observations - the question is how to concisely express where you didn't find anything.

<p>Yes.  The ones that say "I looked at this broad area and found something" would point to the specific things found (supporting the assertion that 'something' was found).  Observations that say "I looked at this broad area and found nothing" wouldn't point at anything.

<p>keep in mind that quality/readability may be upstream of variant calling, and that in some cases (I think Bob M's HLA scenario), variants aren't called at all, in some cases variants are sought at a much later date, etc. While I understand linking region-studied to variants found, they are distinct observations. Think of regions-studied as useful metadata about a study.</p>

<p>So <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> - Again, keeping with my simple example (sequencing a full gene) - We should make sure that if someone asks for Observations on that gene, the query might return one of the following:</p>

<li>Nothing - meaning we have never tested that gene</li>
<li>1 Observation - 1 "Region Tested" Observation with a result value indicating the gene was tested but nothing was found</li>
<li>3 Observations - 1 "Region Tested" Observation with a result value indicating something was found that has links to the two variant Observations, and 2 "DescribedVariant" Observations</li>

<p>So in that case we were close with our proposal. We just need to make sure and use the same Gene component and define a valueBoolean on our region profile. But while that would solve the “easier” case of Sequencing a full gene, we might have to think through what it means for other scenarios. Like WES test. Do we need 20k Observations, one for each gene?  It also gets more complex when the “region” is not as easy to identify as a gene - like exons within a gene where numeric ranges within a sequence come into play.  I am starting to question if we are getting enough value here to warrant the complexity.</p>

<p>The base question is what do we want to be able to query?  If we want to be able to ask the question "has anyone looked at region X and, if so, what was found?", then that level of information needs to be reflected in the Observations to allow the query to be performed.  And the messy space very much is how to express "I ran a chip that looked for 20k variants and didn't find 19,997 of them, but did find 3" in a way that lets you search meaningfully on one of the variants that was checked for and definitively not detected.  Capturing 19997 observations doesn't sound like a lot of fun, but if we don't want to do that, what do we do that will allow the types of search we want?</p>

<p>I think more queries will be on the Interp/Impact side, but on the Findings side my sense is that the two most common queries will be (others will likely disagree and have other much more targetted use cases):<br>
1 - Does this patient have variant X (looking up by an ID value or perhaps HGVS string).<br>
2 - Does this patient have a finding in gene Y (looking up by HGNC).<br>
In both cases, I <em>think</em> it is important that we are able to provide the information that we looked but didn't find anything, but I am honestly not sure how often that really makes a difference?</p>
<p>20k Observations does NOT sound like a good solution to that problem at all - hence my wondering if should move this to Sequence or some other resource?  Perhaps we need something like GenomicsStudy, analogous to the ImagingStudy resource?</p>

<p>I could see the data in that bed file being implemented in one observation (or as a component/extension elsewhere) with 0..* "callable" ranges, 0..* "low coverage" ranges, 0..* "poor mapping quality" ranges, etc. We should be able to set up search methods to query those ranges by position to confirm a range was callable or not, but it isn't obvious to me how the ranges themselves pair up with gene/variant-level queries (if this step is easy then I think we're pretty close?)</p>

<p>We can define "special" search criteria that understand how to work with complex externally-defined data structures, so actually embedding a .bed file or some equivalent in the Observation to describe where we looked and did/did not find anything.

<p>I know <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193751">@Bob Dolin</span> is thinking through a particular use case, but I have to say I have yet to see any use cases that would require .bed file level data.

Sure, Observation is a fairly generic resource that can fit a lot of use cases.  Should we make it work?  I don't think so.</p>
<p>I keep coming back to what I have seen on reports today.  If our goal is to provide more discrete homes for the data currently locked away in those PDFS, I think our original proposal gets us fairly close.  If doing it that way, or at least something close to that way, doesn't align with what an Observation should be, I propose we drop the topic and labs can continue to share that information in the reports as they do today.</p>

<p>Sorry, the 'Region Studied' profile originally suggested by Bob D, with the tweaks of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring we use the same 'gene' component LOINC code, so that a query for a gene would return the region studied + any findings for that gene (I think maybe this is already the case , but we should verify)</li>
<li>Defining the Region Studied to have a result value with a type of (boolean?  Code?) to indicate something was found/nothing was found</li>

<p>Regarding result value to indicate something was found, 2 comments: [1] we need to be clear as to whether we're representing the intended vs. actual regions studied; [2] since variant analysis can be downstream, and because we may define region ranges based on other types of annotations, I'd prefer optional relationships between regions and found variants over an observation value.</p>

<p>If we are using it to hold metadata and pointers to variants found, I don't see why we wouldn't want this to be in the Genomic Panel profile (isn't it right in the name of the discussion group?)

<p>My instinct here would be to take the Impact profiles out of Panel (just keep them in DiagnosticReport) and add this functionality in as a grouper for all the regions tested, by whichever method. Maybe "Panel" is a region-specific term here--we could use the glossary to clarify, or pick a different name... just trying to reduce the overlaps :)</p>

<p>indeed. And in FHIR, that's the SampledData type. I wonder, though, the wisdom of this, given that it's hardly used and there are underlying formats for that data. The same principle applies here, as discussed: if there's an underlying format, why would it not be better to use that?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> I’m jumping in late but just wanted to point out the most labs don’t report every variant found. They typically only report variants the assess to be clinically significant or uncertain significance. Benign or incidental variants are usually not reported unless they are novel and this may vary from lab to lab. You may also note that on larger panels, exonerated and genomes only variants in specific regions are assessed and reported which may or may not include incidental findings for a non requested indication.</p>

<p>In regards to capturing general statements like genes studied... this may be understood but to clarify again , the entirety of a gene is not studied in most cases. The deep intronic regions are not always sequenced or called. I’m not sure if that’s important when we generalize tested regions with a set of hgnc ids.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196622">@Larry Babb</span>  - Both good points.  Labs typically report a small subset of variants, but figuring this out would provide systems who do have all the variants a means to express what they know.  Your second point is indicative of the complexity, but honestly I was OK making more general statements (gene level).  If that is inappropriate or we have concerns someone might use it incorrectly, does that push us to the bed file level as Bob D suggested?</p>

<p>While it's true that not all variants are reported, at the same time it generally is possible to make inferences based on what was tested and what was reported, what definitively <em>does not</em> exist.  That's what we want to expose in a searchable way.</p>

<p>Not that I'm necessarily pushing for bed file, but a couple other considerations: [1] they are easy to obtain / generate (manufacturers of gene panels often include one to indicate intended coverage; they can be automatically generated from SAM/BAM; [2] they enable a more fine-grained approach to Lloyd's use case (i.e. given Larry's comments, what assumptions can you make if you're simply told "HLA-A gene was studied"); [3] fine-grained regions can be annotated for a variety of reasons, such as quality, such as whether variants were found, etc.</p>

Right now I am also part of a medicine informatic initiative <a href="http://highmed.org/" target="_blank" title="http://highmed.org/">http://highmed.org/</a> where we want to optimive the process of storing mutation data and generating a kind of report for a molecular tumorboard at the same time I am working for the Center of Digital Helath (Berlin Institute of Health / Charite in Berlin) where we want establish something similar and of course standardize our mutation results even further. We're eager to participate in global ongoing initiatives like GA4GH initiatives and HL7/FHIR.</p>

<p>reading through the recent messages I would vote for solution 1) proposed by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> . It won't be easy to specify which regions exactly were NOT studied.  The name of a gene panel should somehow lead to the genes it is designed to but I don't think this is in the scope of FHIR right now. I like the suggestion from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span>  of a resource "GenomicStudy" because as far as I understand is that we squeeze a lot into the Obeservation just to stay as generic as possible. There are so many complex mutations which needs to be handled: InDels (short deletion, insetsions), larger Deletions and Insertions, Amplifications, Translocations which might result in gene fusions, inversions..., but again I am new to the FHIR resources and still working on undestranding the relations between observations, sequence resource...</p>

<p>“I think it is important that we are able to provide the information that we looked but didn't find anything, but I am honestly not sure how often that really makes a difference?” @ Kevin Power</p>
<p>Based on this question: </p>
<p>Use Case: <br>
1)  Service request from clinic to lab: for patient A - NGS with Panel-T01<br>
2)  Diagnostic report of Panel-T01 patient A: 1 variant in gene ERBB2 (Her2), 1 variant in gene CDK4 </p>
<p>Now it is necessary to know, if there are any resistance mechanism for treatment known? <br>
Yes - If there is a mutation in gene RB1 and a loss of function (Rb) the treatment with CDK4/6-Inhibitor (e.g. Palbociclib) will not work.</p>
<p>Therefore, as a physician I need the information: Gene RB1 was in the Panel-T01 and it is wildtype (means no variant found).<br>
--&gt; based on the molecular diagnostics a treatment with CD4/6-Inhibitor could theoretically work.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="195522">@Dora Finkeisen</span> for that use case.  We have not spent much time talking about "wild type" results.  But it sounds like your use case above is a great one.  A few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I still think it is OK to separate the concepts of "region studied" and "what was found", though they relate.  A region studied would be included, and as suggested by Lloyd we could include an indicator that nothing was found.  However, we still want to say more about the fact that no variants were found.</li>
<li>It seems we would want to use our Somatic Impact profiles to further describe treatments that will or will not work.</li>
<li>Our DescribedVariant profile will have a valueCodeableConcept from <a href="https://r.details.loinc.org/AnswerList/LL1971-2.html" target="_blank" title="https://r.details.loinc.org/AnswerList/LL1971-2.html">this</a> LOINC answer list.  I suppose we could send a DescribedVariant observation with just the gene level information, and a valueCodeableConcept = Absent?  This would then let the Somatic Impact connections be made as they are defined today.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we would separate the fact that I studied the gene, and the "region-studied" Observation can tell you about how I studied the gene.  Then another Observation (perhaps DescribedVariant, perhaps something else) would say I have observed the fact that this gene matches the reference  Then other observations to tell you about the impact this has.</p>
<p>Anyone think differently?</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196701">@Gideon Giacomelli</span> and welcome to the group!</p>
<p>Question for you - <code>It won't be easy to specify which regions exactly were NOT studied</code><br>
I don't think we are proposing to say was not not studied, but instead will start with a way to say what was studied, then a way to indicate what (if anything) was found in the genes that were studied.</p>
<p>Regarding GenomicsStudy, I do know that requesting new Resources in FHIR is something that needs to be well thought out.  We will need to do some work to define why it is necessary and why other resources don't meet the need.  I tend to lean towards needing something else in this space, but I am not quite ready to make the official request.  Our group are doing some more detailed information modeling, and something might grow from that.</p>
<p>Lastly, regarding  <code>There are so many complex mutations which needs to be handled: InDels (short deletion, insetsions), larger Deletions and Insertions, Amplifications, Translocations which might result in gene fusions, inversions...</code><br>
This is another area we are lacking in.  We have defined <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/sequencing.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/sequencing.html">here</a> some starting points for describing changes, but there is no doubt we can't handle more complex changes.  GA4GH has a work stream going around Variant Representation that we hope to learn from, but of course welcome feedback from anyone who has suggestions on the appropriate way representing those different types.</p>

<p>Great discussion so far, but the topic is getting mixed up a little, i think we should start new topics for the different discussions (e.g. region studied).<br>
My focus was the DiagnosticReport and how to capture panels, requests for panels and the result of a panel in a clinical context.<br>
After reading/hearing all the Input i just want to provide my understanding of it:</p>
<p>When ordering a panel i put the code for a panel in ServiceRequest.code.<br>
<strong>ISSUES:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>ServiceRequest.code: how to capture panelCode -&gt; list of gene codes to look at. This would be important to capture, preferably as a FHIR resource, but i can't find a fitting one.</li>
<li>ServiceRequest.code has the cardinality: 0..1  - how do i order a "custom panel" -&gt; a list of gene codes to look at if only one code is allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>For reporting wildtypes i complete agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> <br>
The lab returns all studied genes as Observations(Described Variant). I have one Observation per found variant or per gene. What was looked at is Observation(Described Variant).component:gene-studied, the overall result (was something found) would be Observation(Described Variant).valueCodeableConcept.<br>
If a Variant was found the details are captured in the components.</p>
<p>So reporting alle studien genes and the results is possible with our profiles. Ordering a panel or a list of genes to be studied is currently not completely supported (see issues above)</p>

<p>In the ServiceRequest you can use the <code>orderDetail</code> element to refine the order (e.g. listing the specific genes of interest).  In general when ordering a panel of tests though, every single test that could be resulted separately must be a separate ServiceRequest.  They are linked by having a common <code>requisition</code> identifier.  For example, if you order a custom blood panel, every test is a separate ServiceRequest, even though they're all ordered together.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  for the explanation. So if i order a 700 gene panel i would place 700 ServiceRequests ignoring that these tests would be executed on one NGS chip? So i would never order a Panel ID - i always would place the seperated requests? Or do i misunderstand the meaning of  </p>

<p>could be resulted separately ?</p>

And speaking of focus, I will have to admit, I wasn't even considering the "ordering" side of describing what regions (genes) are being requested.  So far, this conversation has revolved around the description of "what did we test and analyze".  I would suggest we delay further defining of the specific requests that can come from the ordering side?</p>

<p>You could just order a test at the level of the panel without listing the genes at all.  If you're only wanting a subset of the genes tested, whether you use different service requests or a single request with multiple orderDetails depends on where state lives.  If some pieces can be resulted while others aren't (or some pieces cancelled while others aren't), you'll need separate serviceRequests.  If it's one immutable order that either gets reported or doesn't, then you can have a single ServiceRequest with orderDetails listing the genes.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191451">@Patrick Werner</span>  - OK that we break the servicerequest topic into a different topic since most of the current topic has been focused on "what was tested" conversation (realizing that we really did completely hijack your topic)</p>

<p>Thanks Patrick.</p>
<p>So, any other thoughts on the 3 proposals?  Currently have one vote for Option 1.</p>
<p>As a reminder, here are the three options:</p>
<p>1) Delay - Considering all the conversation around region targeted/studied, defining assays, CLIA approvals etc., perhaps we should not add to the IG right now and consider this more holistically in the future.</p>
<p>2) Gene/Mutation level profile - Create a new profile of Observation that allows describing what was actually studied that looks something like this:</p>
<p>1. Create a new Observation profile, 'Region-Studied', hanging off GeneticsDiagnosticReport. [0..*]<br>
2. Definition for new profile: "The Region-Studied profile is used to assert actual regions studied for the performed test(s). Intended coverage areas may differ from actual coverage areas (e.g. due to technical limitations during test performance).".<br>
3. valueCodeableConcept (LOINC TBD) - Result value to indicate if anything was found<br>
Two kinds of value sets we could consider:<br>
3.1 Simple statement of "Was something found" (Positive, Negative, Unknown)<br>
3.2 Clinical Significance "Was something clinically significant found" (Pathogenic, Benign, Likely Path, Likely Benign, Unknown)<br>
4. Components<br>
component (gene studied) 48018-6 [0..*] (HGNC symbol or NCBI gene code)<br>
component (gene mutations tested for) 36908-2 [0..*] (coded, preferable HGVS)<br>
component (description of ranges of DNA sequences examined) 81293-3 [0..1] (narrative)<br>
component (region scope) TBD [0..1] (Whole Genome | Whole Exome | Gene Panel | Specific Variants)<br>
component (gene coverage) TBD [0..1] numeric (when sequencing, what % of the gene was sequenced)</p>
<p>3) Detailed coverage - Model the FHIR equivalent of the BED file that Bob D referenced earlier (that looks something like this):<br>
20  0   60000   REF_N<br>
20  60000   9999878 NO_COVERAGE<br>
20  9999878 9999905 LOW_COVERAGE<br>

<p>I'd be okay with option #2 for now. Couple minor comments re: option #2: <br>
 - I'd leave out the observation value from the panel observation. This way, we avoid the debate around value set. You'd simply have to look for variants in regions studied in order to know whether or not something was found.<br>
 - May need to tweak the cardinalities a bit (or add clarifying text) - for instance, gene studied is 0..* whereas gene coverage is 0..1.</p>

<p>interesting thoughts. Maybe another question probably just for me: What would be the exact purpose of  this Observation profile, 'Region-Studied'. Is this something the service provider (sequencing the panel) would have to provide? Thy would that be essential information? What information would the Region-Studied include which is not already in the Genetics Diagnostic Reports and in the other Observations the Report is already using?</p>

<p>Is this something the service provider (sequencing the panel) would have to provide? Thy would that be essential <br>
information? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the service provider would include 1 or more of the 'region-studied' Observations to describe what was sequenced.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It is really a way to codify what was tested.  Everything else we have done to date has been to describe what was found.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196701">@Gideon Giacomelli</span> this is something a sequencing provider can provide. Our provider doesn't report ranges, only names of the Genes which were looked at.</p>

<p>As a reminder, we are taking a quick straw poll <a href="#narrow/stream/43-genomics/subject/Capturing.20Genomic.20Panel.20Definitions/near/181411" title="#narrow/stream/43-genomics/subject/Capturing.20Genomic.20Panel.20Definitions/near/181411">here</a> to capture which proposal we should move forward with.  I will likely want to try and finalize this by mid next week, so please click on [1], [2], or [3] emoji's reflecting your preference.</p>
