<p>Congrats to all of you for making this happen.  I'm super impressed by the energy, enthusiasm and work effort of this work group.  (I'm even more impressed that, rather than taking a well-deserved break after getting your IG over the line and submitting it for publication, you've doubled down and almost doubled the volume of discussion on this chat stream as you get excited about what to do next.  You've put together a great team!</p>
