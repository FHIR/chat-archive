<p>We have a source genomics reporting system that we are normalising into v2 and FHIR reports. In an ideal world we would be reporting genes as 21497^ACAD9^HGNC-Symb  or equivalent FHIR coding with <a href="http://genenames.org" target="_blank" title="http://genenames.org">http://genenames.org</a>, 21947, "ACAD9".<br>
Only problem - the source system has treated the gene symbols 'ACAD9' <em>as the code</em>. So the gene id is long gone. Does anyone have any thoughts as to the best way to work around this?<br>
 Is the reverse lookup symbol-&gt;id a safe one (I guess I can do that locally).<br>
 Or is there a loinc observation of gene that is not gene studied[id] - but gene studied[symbol]. <br>
 Or should I just represent the FHIR coding as a coding with no code - just a display name? <br>
It seems like this might be common problem - as even systems doing the right(ish) thing might have treated gene symbol as the code for HGNC and not stored the id</p>

<p>Conveying just the display with no code is legitimate, though obviously not ideal.  I don't know if a reverse lookup is safe with that system or not.</p>

<p>It really want to put the 'system' AND the 'display' - but with no code.. because I really want to say that all the display values come from the HGNC code system display values. But I am guessing that that is illegal</p>

<p>That's legal in FHIR - though it might not be accepted by all systems.  And it can't be treated as "computable"</p>

<p>right it's not illegal, but the implications of having a system + a display but not code are not documented and might cause confusion. So proceed with caution</p>

<p>as for reverse lookup - is there any display associated with more than one code? There <em>should not</em> be</p>

<p>I'll investigate some more whether I can retrieve the id myself given the symbol. I believe the only issue with the reverse lookup will be historical - at any point in time release, each HGNC id has exactly one display symbol - but when the retire/rename symbols I'm not sure whether they expire the id or not. I can't see how display names could be associated with more than one <em>current</em> code</p>

<p>y. so someone might have built a history table... but at some point, it's more work than justified</p>

<p>If I do put it in a just the symbol (as the display) - the downstream users <em>will</em> treat it as computable (no matter what I tell them)</p>

<p>I can make a strong argument about not matching on a display string like 'breast cancer gene 1'.. it is harder for me to make the same argument about something that is actually a code itself like 'BRCA1'. I will try though.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not all our members with HGNC experience follow Zulip.  You will likely get additional responses on questions like the safety in doing symbol-&gt;gene ID lookups  if you ask this question on our list serv email (<a href="mailto:clingenomics@lists.hl7.org" title="mailto:clingenomics@lists.hl7.org">clingenomics@lists.hl7.org</a>).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span> I see two issues here - what you can do with your unusual situation, and what your unusual situation might implicate for others regarding what "FHIR allows and encourages." You've already heard that a display and system is not illegal but is strongly discouraged. Granted many others will not ask and simply do this and there is nothing we can do to stop that , but since you've asked, I'd strongly suggest you fix the data before you put it into an exchange format (ie: FHIR.) You've already indicated it should/might be possible - I'd certainly hope and assume it would be. If it really is a code system, then there should be a source that would support getting a code for each display, right? I for one would strongly suggest you fix anything you have. I don't think that is improper or asserting knowledge - if not you, it will be someone else less capable!</p>

<p>I think HGNC is a bit unusual - the display value is itself also a valid code - it follows all the rules for codes in code systems (unique, unchanging, concept permanence etc).<br>
If a programmer was storing just the display text of 'diabetes mellitus' in their database rather than the SNOMED id - I would feel justified at yelling at them.<br>
If someone is just storing HGNC 'symbols' as codes, I'm not sure how good my argument is that they are wrong. So I will look to get the ids from a reverse mapping - but just flagging that I think this is a code system that might cause issues in practice.</p>

<p>FWIW - I think it is a pretty common to use the symbol as the 'code'.  So it's not just your system :)</p>
