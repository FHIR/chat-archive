<p>At Optum we have healthcare financial products such as Health Saving Accounts (HSA) and Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) to name a few, that we would like to map the data elements to FHIR resources. The “Account” FHIR resource is the obvious choice but I don’t think the existing “Account” resource has the level of detail we need in order to map all data elements, such as subscriber account balances and account summary level balance monetary amounts. Can anyone tell me if FHIR objects already exist for this type of data? I can’t seem to find them. I’ll be attending the HL7 Financial Management work group sessions where I can also bring up this topic for discussion. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191924">@Linda</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191430">@Paul Knapp</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196176">@Sonja Ziegler</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191884">@MaryKay McDaniel</span></p>

<p>Has anyone done a domain model for Finance?  It feels like it is needed to insure we correctly represent all the components needed.  FM is discussing how to handle Appeals and Grievances on their call next Tuesday.  This is an additional topic.  There are also challenges around Coverage.  Happy to participate but DAM's are not my area of expertise.</p>

<p>FM is reviewing the Account resource on the Payment, Statement calls, Tuesday 4PM eastern, and will be adding balances back into the resource. Fr FSA and HSA we should discuss on FM what you are trying to do: reference an FSA/HSA, use Coverage, manage and FSA/HSA, use Account I expect.</p>

<p>When we discussed "Coverage" at last September Working Group Meeting -there were a few trackers logged which may now all be applied in current build.  However, I think dependent should be an identifier, etc. And there seemed to be much discussion and not unity on the type element list as well as the coverage class code list.  I think it would be worthwhile to review one an upcoming call whether it be FM or the Payment/Statements call.  Also during that meeting in September, several people (me included) mentioned needing a DAM for representing all data in the Finance space in US.</p>
