<p>We are performing coverage verification and discovery based on patient appointments. The tool performing the operations uses X12, and the response is then put into FHIR resources. When we create a CoverageEligibilityResponse, we find that it requires a reference to the Request, but we don't have that resource. We could impute one, but the information is not used.</p>
<p>In the near term, we think we'd prefer a "light" reference (reference.display = "Insurance capture query") to a DAR, but we would like to hear how others may be dealing with this issue.</p>
<p>In the long term, we wonder if the cardinality constraint might be relaxed.</p>

<p>+1 to this.  In general, the FM resources shouldn't be expressed as 'responses' - they should allow for sharing records asserting determinations of eligibility, prior authorization, etc. without requiring that a formal request has been submitted.</p>
