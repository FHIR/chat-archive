<p>Hi all, I'm new to FHIR and am trying to find resources and attributes in FHIR which can map to the payment method - Check, debit card, EFT etc. I found a code system <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v2/0570/index.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v2/0570/index.html</a> but it is not currently in use. Even if it was, how do I use it ie. in which attribute of which resource ?</p>

<p>This is a question that keeps popping up sporadically in the community.<br>
We had a discussion about it <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/payor's.20bank.20account.20information">here</a> resulting in <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-13471?filter=-2">this change request</a>.<br>
FM decided not to add this information to Coverage as suggested in the CR and to place it in Account instead. However, no changes have been made to Account as far as I can see to accomodate the payment details...<br>
