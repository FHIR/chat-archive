<p>Hi, working with <a href="https://adhocteam.us/">AdHoc</a> and CMS on <a href="https://dpc.cms.gov/">DPC</a> and <a href="https://bcda.cms.gov/">BCDA</a>.  As part of that effort, we're mapping <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/sharedsavingsprogram/Downloads/2019-CCLF-file-data-elements-resource.pdf">CCLF fields</a> to FHIR.  When this is completed, finalized and reviewed, wondering if this is something that should be added to  the FHIR spec mappings e.g. <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/explanationofbenefit-mappings.html">EOB mappings</a></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192646">@Bill Harty</span> Yes it may be valuable to provide those mappings but  like the CARIN for Blue Button mappings you may need to specify the mapping in an implementation guide to capture the logical data model (CPCDS) and then the mapping of that data to FHIR.  I'm one of the HL7 Financial Management co-chairs, please come to one of our calls (Tuesday 11-1 ET) to discuss.</p>

<p>Thanks Paul.  Starting with the IG makes a lot of sense and I will join a Tues call soon.  I've just recently joined the AdHoc team, so still getting my feet wet, but the impression I've gotten so far is that we're maybe a bit disconnected from the FHIR community so I'd like to also pick your brain on that.  I'd like to ensure that, where it makes sense, the DPC + BCDA projects stay aligned with and collaborate with DaVinci, Financial Mgmt Group, Argonaut, etc.  Thanks again for your feedback.  Talk soon.</p>
