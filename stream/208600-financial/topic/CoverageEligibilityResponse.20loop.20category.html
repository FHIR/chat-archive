<p>X12 271 contains a loop structure to represent many facts in one message, and it's really a metamodel. The first property tells you what kind of thing it is (active coverage, copay amount, benefit exclusion, etc.) and the other properties' semantics change accordingly.</p>
<p>The FHIR CoverageEligibilityResponse has what looks like the right field, insurance.item.category, but the values are described as categories of service. It's an example binding, so we can put the "kind of loop" values in there, but it seems confusing. Is this the right target?</p>
