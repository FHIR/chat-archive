<p>There is a new (better named) stream for PDex - <a class="stream" data-stream-id="235286" href="/#narrow/stream/235286-Da-Vinci-PDex">#Da Vinci PDex</a><br>
(We should ideally have renamed this stream, but given that there is useful content now in both places, it's too late for that).  From this point forward, we're going to have all discussion on the PDex stream.  We'll probably eventually delete this one.  If you have outstanding questions here that are not yet answered, please re-raise them on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="235286" href="/#narrow/stream/235286-Da-Vinci-PDex">#Da Vinci PDex</a></p>
