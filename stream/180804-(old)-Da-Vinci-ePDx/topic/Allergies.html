<p>As a user story reminder <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192054">@Viet Nguyen</span> , when the same allergy is re-written for a different date, we still only show one allergy (being de-duped), so need different allergies for the patient to show more clearly it was received.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191689">@Hans Buitendijk</span>  i see an earlier comment from you that every time a different allergy would have to be written to show up as a new entry in the EMR system.  Could you share similar guidelines for medications, conditions and document reference resources so that they are visible as new entries every time.</p>

<p>Bob Dieterle and I are going to send out a summary of each interaction (eCDx, ePDx, CRD, and MRP) to confirm that each payer/vendor/EHR supports what we believe they support. For ePDx, we'll need to know which resources (medication, condition, allergyintolerance, Docref) each participant will support. I will then create a list of clinical data for ePDx for each resource and ask each participant to support several of them. That way, if you're writing a resource to Cerner during the course of the day, the information will  be coherent and not be duplicative.  For example, we'll have at least 8 different conditions that will be written to the EHR once each during the day.  </p>
<p>We'll make this clearer in our HIMSS Vignette call next week.</p>
