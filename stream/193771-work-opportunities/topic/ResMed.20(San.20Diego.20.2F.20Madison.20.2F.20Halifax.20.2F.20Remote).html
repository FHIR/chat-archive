<p>ResMed is hiring an engineer to help build the future of digital health and medical devices leveraging FHIR. The role will be focused on implementing FHIR in our API-1st product platform as well as bringing online millions of patients, providers and medical devices to the platform. We're still in early stages so there's a lot of hard problems left to solve, and this role will be hugely influential in the direction of the use of FHIR in the product platform. If you're an API developer and you're looking to solve hard technical problems with FHIR as well as contribute day-to-day to a leading open source FHIR implementation, give this opportunity a chance. We have offices in San Diego, Madison and Halifax but are open to remote as well.</p>
