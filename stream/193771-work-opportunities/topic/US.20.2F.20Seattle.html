<p>Truveta is a healthcare startup cofounded by 17 leading health systems that collectively provide more than 15% of healthcare in the US. Our vision is to save lives with data, and we do that by aggregating and standardizing data of tens of millions of patients to enable clinical research. We are looking for a Clinical Terminologist Lead to help us with standardizing data from disparate systems. Clinical background and strong experience in SNOMED CT, LOINC and RxNorm, as well as managing both structured and unstructured data are preferred. Informatics training is a bonus. Please apply directly or contact Senthil Nachimuthu (<a href="mailto:senthiln@truveta.com">senthiln@truveta.com</a>) if you have any questions.<br>
