<p>Do you have a personal drive to be an educator? Do you enjoy the experience of the ‘a-ha’ moment when a trainee ‘gets it’ ?</p>
<p>Firely are looking to strengthen their educational team with a US-based part-time FHIR trainer. You will be providing FHIR training courses (basic, intermediary and advanced) to US and international audiences. You will work with the team to maintain, create and update training materials as well as their delivery mode (e.g. online, blended, flipped classroom).</p>
<p>Are you an educator at heart, or willing to learn to be an educator? Do you know the basics of FHIR, and of some of the US FHIR Implementation Guides ? If so, please contact Rene Spronk (Firely’s training coordinator) at <a href="mailto:rene@fire.ly">rene@fire.ly</a> or DM Rene on this forum.</p>
