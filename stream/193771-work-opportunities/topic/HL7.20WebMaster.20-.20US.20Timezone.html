<p>Applicants can be anywhere but the position is based in US timezone.</p>
<p>Note: yes, this does mean that unfortunately <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193461">@David Johnson</span> is leaving us. We're very sad about that but he's been made an offer too good to refuse. Follow ups on DJ either on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179160" href="/#narrow/stream/179160-social">#social</a> or to David directly. This is an incredible set of skills, knowledge and passion to have to replace <span aria-label="cry" class="emoji emoji-1f622" role="img" title="cry">:cry:</span></p>
