<p>We're looking for an integration specialist with practical knowledge and skills to design and implement HL7 v2.x and FHIR based interfaces. Our existing integrations use Mirth Connect but we are working to add native FHIR based health information exchange capabilities to our software platform. Position is currently on a part-time / per assignment basis with possibility to go for a permanent position. Working conditions include flexible time and working in remote (although New Zealand, Australia, Singapore and Europe is preferable).</p>
<p>If interested or if you know someone who may be interested, could you please pass the information / CV to <a href="mailto:koray@theclinician.com" title="mailto:koray@theclinician.com">koray@theclinician.com</a>?</p>
