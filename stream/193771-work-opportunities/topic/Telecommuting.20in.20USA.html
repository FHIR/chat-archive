<p>We are a start-up company working on an EMR data integration app that has been in development for 4 years now. We are still early but have clients. </p>
<p>We built our platform on Allscripts Unity, but want to port the app to SMART on FHIR and integrate with Epic and other FHIR-complaint EMRs. We are looking for someone with experience in FHIR (and hopefully Epic integration) who would take on this project in a part-time role and work with our small team as we complete an MVP. There is an opportunity to grow this into a full-time position if desired if the MVP is successful. </p>
