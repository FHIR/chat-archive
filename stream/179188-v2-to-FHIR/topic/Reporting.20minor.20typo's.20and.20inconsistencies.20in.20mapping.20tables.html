<p>I've found the mapping tables associated with each resource quire useful and wondered what the best option was to have minor typo's and inconsistencies fixed - I'm assuming "Change request" for each resource would be the way to do it, but just wanted to confirm.<br>
For example:<br>
For the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/servicerequest-mappings.html#v2">ServiceRequest V2 mappings</a> :</p>
<ul>
<li>"priority" has "TQ1.9" but I think it should be "TQ.6"</li>
<li>" performerType" has "RF!-3", but it should be "RF1-3"</li>
</ul>
<p>For <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-mappings.html#v2">Observation V2 mappings</a>  (and similar inconsistencies in other resources) where the separator between segment and segment number is either a hypen (-) or a dot (.):</p>
<ul>
<li>"identifier" description has both "OBX.21" and "OBX-21"</li>
<li>"performer" has both "OBX.15" and OBX-16"</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm assuming the hypen (-) is the correct term, but just to clarify hypens (-) are used to separate segments and their respective field numbers and dots (.) are used to separate data types and their respective elements?</p>

<p>You are correct, that - should be used for the field and . should be used for component - we will need to update those mappings to be consistent (would you mind adding a jira for each resource, where you find it?).</p>

<p>As far as the identified mappings: priority should be TQ1-9, you are correct about the typo of! instead of 1.</p>
