<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> : You had indicated you have tooling to take a spreadsheet, put it in a structured format (e.g., FHIR mapping language), and then re-render a spreadsheet look for an IG.  We would like to discuss the desired gitHub structure to put in the .csv (or equivalent spreadsheet representation) that document the proposed mappings, as well as other IG sections (we are starting to build a facade in Confluence for now to get a sense of what we need and how it relates until we have the formal location sorted).  Additionally, we want to use a non-.csv format to run a set of validations against to ensure the content is valid (which in turn can yield updates back in the spreadsheets).</p>
<p>What would be a good timewindow to get on a dedicated call with the team to talk through this and determine who has what, what is missing, and determine who can fill what gaps as part of a first draft IG?</p>

<p>Monday 1-2 ET and Tuesday 11-12 ET, so not real friendly for your timezone.  Happy to set up another time that Robert Worden might also still make.</p>
