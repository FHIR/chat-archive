<p>**Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>I want to know, should anyone know about any middle ware translation engine which is used to translate HL7 v2 message to FHIR resource? If anyone (in the industry or academia) is working or know about any v2 to FHIR mapping framework(model), then please share information with me. I want to just confirm it that should such type model is available or not.</p>
<p>I understand that some people are working in this area, but I assume that there is no middle ware engine available and people are working to map specific resources from their own develop framework not through common framework. Am I right? Please advise me in this regard.</p>
<p>I would be so thankful, if he or she can share information with me through my email ( [mohd.ayazkn@gmail.com]<br>
Looking forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="253211">@Ayaz</span> there is a v2 to FHIR project (see <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/OO/2-To-FHIR+Project" target="_blank" title="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/OO/2-To-FHIR+Project">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/OO/2-To-FHIR+Project</a>). So far we have worked on proof of concept mappings of a few of the more common v2 message types (ADT, orders, results, vaccinations). There are a few translation engines being developed.  Please have a look at the project and see if that helps.</p>

<p>Dear colleagues, <br>
Thank you for your reply. Interesting to know about the v2 to FHIR project page. But as I pointed out in my previous message, I'm more interested with efforts on implementation side. Since you mentioned about few translation engines being developed, can you provide links to that project?<br>
Thanks,<br>
Ayaz</p>

<p>I'd think that the commercial vendors of existing translation engines (communication servers, message brokers) that are used in healthcare probably have the most hands-on experience.</p>

<p>Hi Ayaz - We (Microsoft) just announced an open source project that takes in an HL7 v2 message and leverages handlebars templates to produce a json FHIR bundle output. The tool is seeded with some starting templates that were generated based on the 2-To-FHIR-Project that Craig mentioned above. You can see the project here (<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter">https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter</a>) and let me know if you have any questions!</p>
