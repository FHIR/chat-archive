<p>To which resource in FHIR, can we map the patient type? its more like PV1.18 of HL7 v2.</p>

<p>I think this may be a very difficult question to answer without some knowledge of your systems are using it. The base definition is vague and there are no suggested values in table 0018, so it's difficult to know how any given implementation has interpreted it. I could see it contributing to either Encounter. type or .class but the exact meaning may vary from implementation to implementation. The v2-to-FHIR project has mapped a number of different messages and segments and there's not always a singular mapping and sometimes it has to be an implementation specific decision.</p>
