<p>While for MSH-15 one can reasonably argue that its value need not be communicated beyond the v2-to-FHIR mapping engine when using FHIR messaging, the intent of MSH-16 needs to be mapped to a FHIR construct and be reacted to by the ultimate receiver.  The way in which communication is completed with the receiver the mapping may  vary.  E.g., if continued as a FHIR message, perhaps it could be on the HTTP header if HTTP is used.  If another method is chosen where a response is needed, that would not work.<br>
The question is whether MSH-16 should therefore always be mapped to the MessageHeader resource (extension or core attribute) so the method of communication is irrelevant, OR whether it should be conveyed outside the MessageHeader.</p>
<p>We seek opinions/suggestions on approach.</p>
