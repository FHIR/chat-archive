<p>•   Today we are starting the first Community Review of the OBX segment: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--KYCqp4IKrDO4NyW6ieA69pJylKfnGYHoOTAU7Rkyk/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--KYCqp4IKrDO4NyW6ieA69pJylKfnGYHoOTAU7Rkyk/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--KYCqp4IKrDO4NyW6ieA69pJylKfnGYHoOTAU7Rkyk/edit#gid=0</a>. <br>
•   <br>
•   This is NOT a ballot, rather the first opportunity to get wider input into the completeness and correctness of the proposed mapping.  The intent is to solicit any comments to:<br>
•   Validate any mappings starting at the segment level, as well as for the referenced data types, which in turn may reference further data types, i.e., column F and onwards.<br>
o   Note that if the Condition cell is empty, that mapping is always meant to occur.<br>
o   Note that if a v2 field is included multiple times with different conditions, any condition that is true results in the subsequent mapping.  We left the Derived Mapping column in for now, but that is expected to be removed once we are comfortable this approach works.<br>
•   Identify segment fields that may not be mapped to a FHIR attribute, but you are using, so there should be a mapping.</p>
<p>Comments and suggested updates should be entered in the spreadsheet against the cell to which they apply (select the cell and click on the + icon in the short cut bar).  We appreciate to include in your comment the problem (if the cell is not blank) and a proposed solution/wording.</p>
<p>The deadline for your comments is September 13 as on September 14 we start to review the comments during our Connectathon and subsequent project team meetings.</p>
<p>Any questions, please contact Craig and/or myself.</p>

<p>•   We determined that we need to split the OBX mapping into an OBX[Observation] (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--KYCqp4IKrDO4NyW6ieA69pJylKfnGYHoOTAU7Rkyk/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--KYCqp4IKrDO4NyW6ieA69pJylKfnGYHoOTAU7Rkyk/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--KYCqp4IKrDO4NyW6ieA69pJylKfnGYHoOTAU7Rkyk/edit#gid=0</a>)  and OBX[ObservationComponent] (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1otkCEXuRkQy7kJ--_4WycdG2yQSM7eSfT9t8AUtylck/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1otkCEXuRkQy7kJ--_4WycdG2yQSM7eSfT9t8AUtylck/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1otkCEXuRkQy7kJ--_4WycdG2yQSM7eSfT9t8AUtylck/edit#gid=0</a>) mapping, recognizing that which one to use will be driven based on the use of the OBX in a message and conditions that may involve multiple OBX instances.  Considering that, and the ballot period reducing bandwidth, we are re-starting the Community Review.<br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191689">@Hans Buitendijk</span> Not sure if this is obvious to everyone but what HL7v2 version is being implicitly referred in the Google Doc for mapping. The reason I ask I only see upto OBX-26 here <a href="https://hl7-definition.caristix.com/v2/HL7v2.7/Fields/OBX.17" target="_blank" title="https://hl7-definition.caristix.com/v2/HL7v2.7/Fields/OBX.17">https://hl7-definition.caristix.com/v2/HL7v2.7/Fields/OBX.17</a> but in the spreadsheets there are references to OBX-30 so which v2 version is the mapping for?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191783">@Daya Sharma</span> : We are actually mapping to the cumulative versions, starting with v2.8.2 (soon v2.9 once published), but then include everything that was deprecated as well using the last definition for the element at the time it was deprecated.  Therefore, if you are trying to map a v2.3.1, or a v.2.8.2, everything present would map as intended.  Clearly, in a v2.3.1 something may be a CE and now a CWE, or an ID and now a CNE, etc.  But since those updates were all backwards compatible, the positions in the message still are effectively the same when present.  For the name/descriptions we do use the latest, e.g., Interpretation rather than Abnormal Flags in OBX, but again, that is not changing the mapping based on the version one starts with.  For Vocabulary that works as well as we do not re-use codes and their meaning, so if deprecated, a new one should not be created with the same code but different meaning.</p>
<p>In the case you are seeing, Casistix provided the information on v2.7.  Since that time we went up to v2.8.2 (current publication), and v2.9 is about to be published.  If you only work with v2.7 at the moment, you can ignore OBX-27 onwards and check whether the mappings up to then still work.</p>

<p>Thanks for the detailed explanation <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191689">@Hans Buitendijk</span></p>
