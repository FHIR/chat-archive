<p>Today we are starting the first Community Review of the VXU Message:<br>
•https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_7maXDpc_qMMRzMm0x6d90-Hj6vvhGyO2kyFX0tpuZs/edit#gid=0</p>
<p>• This is NOT a ballot, rather the first opportunity to get wider input into the completeness and correctness of the proposed mapping. The intent is to solicit any comments to:<br>
• Validate any mappings starting at the message level, as well as for the referenced segments or data types, which in turn may reference further data types<br>
o Note that if the Condition cell is empty, that mapping is always meant to occur.<br>
• Identify segments that may not be mapped to a FHIR resource, but you are using, so there should be a mapping.</p>
<p>Comments and suggested updates should be entered in the spreadsheet against the cell to which they apply (select the cell and click on the + icon in the short cut bar). We appreciate to include in your comment the problem (if the cell is not blank) and a proposed solution/wording.</p>
<p>The deadline for your comments is December 23.</p>
<p>Any questions, please contact Hans and/or myself.</p>
