<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am mapping ORUs to FHIR. Need some advise regarding the formatting of the string data in Observation.value . Consider an example where we convert a report in raw form from OBX segment(s): &lt;b&gt;CLINICAL HISTORY:&lt;/b&gt; RUQ pain&lt;br/&gt;. &lt;b&gt;COMMENTS:&lt;/b&gt; The visualized liver is of uniform echo texture without evidence of mass or defect. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The common bile duct measures up to 4 mm. The gallbladder is physiologically distended with multiple calculi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;IMPRESSION&lt;/b&gt;: Multiple gallstones with a thickened gallbladder wall and reported positive Murphy's sign. These findings are concerning for acute or chronic cholecystitis. Please correlate clinically&lt;br/&gt;. Is the expectation that when we convert this from OBX to FHIR, it should be already formatted or there is a way to format this in FHIR as well? I got some input from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191912">@Michele Mottini</span>  that valueAttachment is a good option but is currently not scoped in R4 and shall be available in R5. What is best approach in the current circumstances?</p>
