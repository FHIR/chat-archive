<p>We are trying to define a FHIR version of a COVID-19 at home test result with Ask at Order Entry Questions (must have all the information needed for V2 ELR R1 message - example attached) and want to hear your thoughts on how to best include the HHS questions.<br>
We think from a modeling perspective they belong in Observation.basedOn(ServiceRequest.supportingInfo(Observation)).<br>
Using the approach from the V2 to FHIR mapping, that each OBR becomes a diagnostic report we would end up with:USCoreDiagnosticReport for labs<br>
Referencing UsCoreLabObs (an observation that has to be a lab)<br>
Contains the single Covid test lab result<br>
Referencing Observation.basedOn(ServiceRequest.supportingInfo(Observation))<br>
Contains the "QA Pairs" for the sorta kinda AOE observations<br>
Alternatively use USCoreLabObs<br>
Represents the single lab result<br>
Referencing Observation.basedOn(ServiceRequest.supportingInfo(Observation))<br>
Contains the "QA Pairs" for the sorta kinda AOE observations</p>
<p>Other ideas were to use observation.HasMember to represent the AOEs.<br>
We didn't think we needed to model them using questionaireResponse, though the USCoreDiagnosticReport profile allows Observation.basedOn(ServiceRequest.supportingInfo(QuestionnaireResponse)).<br>
Given that there will be a lot of references, we think this should be communicated as a bundle to avoid pingbacks to the application that originates the FHIR communications, but would like community input here as well.<br>
And would you structure this differently, if they were "true" Ask at Order Entry Questions needed for proper result interpretation?  </p>

<p>My recommendation would be to skip the DiagnosticReport.  You're not looking at an attested report, you're looking at a simple question/answer pair - and Observation is more than sufficient for that.  Agree that multiple Observations are probably better than a single QuestionnaireResponse because the former are more computable.  As for Bundle, you could certainly send a transaction and ask to record all of the data.  However, if some/all of the Observations are intrinsically tied to the ServiceRequest and have no relevance or independent existence outside the ServiceRequest, you could just 'contain' them in the ServiceRequest.</p>

<p>Great! - My leaning was also to skip DiagnosticReport. The simpler the better in this use case. And "contained" is also a great idea for this use case.</p>
