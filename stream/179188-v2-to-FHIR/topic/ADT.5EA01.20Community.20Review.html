<p>Today we are starting the first Community Review of the ADT message map:<br>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kPOewgrlY4Mpi8W3HyLzb5J-tuZnUBAzgsXuhX5lcGo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kPOewgrlY4Mpi8W3HyLzb5J-tuZnUBAzgsXuhX5lcGo/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kPOewgrlY4Mpi8W3HyLzb5J-tuZnUBAzgsXuhX5lcGo/edit#gid=0</a> <br>
-This is the first of the message maps we are putting out for community review<br>
-This is NOT a ballot, rather the first opportunity to get wider input into the completeness and correctness of the proposed mapping. <br>
The intent is to solicit any comments to:<br>
-The overall organization of the message map<br>
-The appropriateness of the segment to segment map associations<br>
-The clarity and completeness of any comments associated with a segment<br>
-The format and accuracy of noted resource references<br>
Comments and suggested updates should be entered in the spreadsheet against the cell to which they apply (select the cell and click on the + icon in the short cut bar). We appreciate to include in your comment the problem (if the cell is not blank) and a proposed solution/wording.<br>
The deadline for your comments is November 10th.<br>
Any questions, please contact Hans and/or myself.</p>
