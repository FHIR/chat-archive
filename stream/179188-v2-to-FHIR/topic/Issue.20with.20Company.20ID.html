<p>Hello All,<br>
IN1-3 &amp; AUT-2 both are denoting Company ID however, datatype is different. IN1-3 is of CX datatype &amp; AUT-2 is of CWE datatype.<br>
Any specific reason for this.<br>
Thanks</p>

<p>Yes unfortunately that has to do with when these elements were created - at some point the differentiation between identifiers (pointing to instances) and codes (pointing to kinds of things) wasn't as clearly made - the correct datatype for any identifier (that points to an instance - think VIN number of the car) should be an EI (if the type of identifier is always the same) or a CX (if the type of identifier could change), but for kinds of things - think make and model of a car it should be CWE (or CNE, if you have every kind covered).</p>

<p>Thank you <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191698">@Riki Merrick</span> for the details and I completely agree with you. However, as per spec, I saw both fields have same value in sample example, due to which I am confused. If, we are expecting same values then ideally datatype should also be same.</p>
