<p>I think we need to include discussion of DocumentReference as part of this. Depending on where we draw the boundaries around Media, it will influence how DocumentReference is used. Is Media imaging/video/audio and DocumentReference everything else? Is Media "clinical content," and DocumentReference everything else? If Observation is the interpretation and Media is the underlying data (for at least some types of underlying data), then given that DocumentReference can capture much of the clinical context of that underlying data anyhow, why do we need both DocumentReference and Media?</p>

<p>I think were are going in circles.   Media is positioned be  Clinical Observations with media type as values.   DocumentReference is all about the document and DocumentRetrieval  I would not consider it a freestanding Observation.  They  both use Attachment and can point to the same thingy but that is where the similarity ends.</p>
