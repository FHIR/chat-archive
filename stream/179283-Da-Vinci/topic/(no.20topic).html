<p>At the Philadelphia Da Vinci Connectathon two questions were raised that each have two parts:<br>
1.1 How does a Health Plan know where to send the communication request and also <br>
1.2 How to identify that a request was from a legitimate sender<br>
2.1 Does the old payer need to provide data they may have received from a previous payer? (In the case where the new payer is the third payer in the 5 year period <br>
2.2 Who is responsible for getting data from the oldest payer?)<br>
I am going to work on a Google Doc that attempts to address these questions and will post it here for comment.</p>
