<p>I am working on creating the profiles for the Coverage Discovery work.  I have the master list of resources and such (20180702 V03.03) and I have some questions:<br>
1) Some of the resources have multiple tabs - Organization, Location, Coverage, Patient, Practitioner, Observation.  It seems that in those cases one of the tabs has some constraints while the other doesn't.  Is it safe to ignore the tabs that don't have constraints?<br>
2) The EligibilityRequest and EligibilityResponse have some additional fields listed at the bottom of their sheet.  Can I assume that those are desired extensions?<br>
3) There is an Extensions tab that has digitalCertificate information but it doesn't say what resource this is for.<br>
4) For any tab that has no comments, can we assume that there are no differences from the base resources and thus no profile is needed?</p>
