<p>HRex has been looking at Encounters especially as they relate to ADT's. The US Core Profile for Encounter, requires the element, type. Currently Encounter.type is bound extensibly to the CPT E&amp;M codes. However, E&amp;M Codes represent the interaction between a practitioner/provider and a patient not a facility and a patient like ADT's do. We know that we can add code sets there but would like to" fly in formation"/harmonize and take the same approach that other vendors/institutions are in this area. What code sets/values are you using for encounter.type between the facility and the patient? Do you think this should be a recommendation to formalize in US Core? ThanQ in advance for the insight!</p>
