<p>Hello <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192119">@Yan Heras</span>  or <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194421">@Linda Michaelsen</span>,  I work in a payor org and we're looking to expose care gaps data as per the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-deqm/gaps-in-care-reporting.html">IG</a>. A few questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>It appears that the purpose of the DetectedIssue resource is to convey the status of the care gap. Why not embed that as an extension on the MeasureReport resource instead?</li>
<li>The cardinality on Composition suggests that it can focus on a particular MeasureReport and have multiple DetectedIssue resources under "entry" element. Does it mean a specific measure for a member can have multiple care gaps? When would this happen?</li>
<li>The cardinality on DetectedIssue suggests that a care gap can point to more than one MeasureReport. What would be the use case for this?</li>
<li>What would be the source of the Measure library resources? Would it come from HL7 or would each org come up with their list of measures?</li>
<li>Is the MeasureReport expected to be generated on the fly when requested by the client or a resource persisted on the FHIR server, one per patient per measure per year and just presented to the client when requested?</li>
</ol>

<p>To answer #1 - Our thought behind Detested Issue was that a receiving system could use it to track the status on their system.  Also there is new work being done where the Detected Issue resource will allow for the Guidance Resource to advise the user on what to do to close the gap (join DEQM to follow this work).  You can tell by the group.measureScore element on the MeasureReport if the status is 1</p>

<p>#5 - $care-gaps expects the operation to be run upon request and generate the Care Gap Composition.  You could generate MeasureReports and retrieve them with something like $report described in the Risk Adjustment IG but once a year would not serve people well if they are trying to close gaps by generating he report, using $submiti-data to close the gaps and then run the Care Gaps report again</p>

<p>I am intentionally not speaking to #2 and #3 because I haven't had time to look at the IG - hoping <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197045">@Sam Sayer</span> or <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="217210">@Rob Reynolds</span> can help there.  I do know that a Care Gap Report (Composition) is for a single member and can have 1 to many MeasureReports and their evaluatedResources.  Each MeasureReport references a single Measure and each Measure should have a DetectedIssue if that helps.  I can't address the multiple DetectedIssue until I or hopefully Sam/Rob can look at and address</p>

<p>Would the Measure resource not have the detail about how the measure is calculated and thereby how to close it (qualifying numerator criteria)? Would the guidance is subjective and vary with patient? Could there be more than 1 Guidance resources to close a given care gap?</p>

<p>Do these entities already have Measure libraries that are ready for us to use? I'm curious there'll be a new instance of each measure published by these entities for every new measurement year since the measure specs tend to change on an annual basis. Also, if our org wants to track custom measures, I assume we can create our own library in our FHIR server. Do you see any issues with that?</p>

<p>I can speak a bit towards 2., as it's something we've considered for our prototype of a $care-gaps implementation.</p>
<p>We think of one <em>DetectedIssue</em> resource as one "gap" that can be addressed via some action (e.g. ordering a colonoscopy for a patient). Some Measures could have a Numerator statement that is the <strong>and</strong> of 2 queries for data for example. So in order for the patient to be in the Numerator, they need these two specific pieces of data to both be present. In our implementation of $care-gaps, it would generate a DetectedIssue resource for each piece of that <strong>and</strong> clause, and treat each piece as its own gap. If you resolve one of them, one <em>DetectedIssue</em> would go away, but the other would remain.</p>

<p>In such cases, how would we convey the overall status of the patient's measure? Is that via the 0/1 in the group.measureScore? Do you have an example of a measure that requires two independent actions taken to satisfy the measure numerator?</p>

<p>That's interesting. Based on <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-deqm/gaps-in-care-reporting.html#:~:text=A%20report%20calculated,of%E2%80%9D%20previous%20dates.">this statement in the IG</a>, it seems like the periodStart and periodEnd only serve to identify prospective (current year) vs retrospective (any prior year) measures. The MeasureReport and DetectedIssue resources returned for a retrospective measure would be the same regardless of what month and date is passed in the period dates as long as the year part is the prior year. So the FHIR server could have a single instance of each MeasureReport per patient per measure per year and keep updating its "group" element as new evidence is evaluated. However, a MeasureReport for a group of patients would need to be put together on the fly based on the data in each patient's persisted MeasureReport. Does my understanding align or oppose the intent of the IG? Given that our current evaluation of evidence to determine measure outcomes and care gaps happens in commercial third-party software that runs on scheduled batch cycles, we can't technically do on-the-fly calculations anyway. At least not until the FHIR server is fed with CQL for each measure.</p>

Regarding 3.</p>
<p>It seems that way within just the context of DetectedIssue.</p>
<p>However, if you consider the context of how you got to the DetectedIssue, it's not the case that a DetectedIssue can refer to more than one MeasureReport.</p>
<p>Composition has a section element that is 1..*.  The section states that each section corresponds to an individual MeasureReport.</p>
<p>Within that context, the section has an entry element that is 1..*. All of those entry elements (which are references to DetectedIssue) correspond to the same individual MeasureReport.</p>
<p>The DetectedIssue Profile specifies that it "indicates that the measure reported has n open or closed gap..." Which is the "measure reported"?  The MeasureReport that is in context from the Composition section.</p>
<p>You can have 1..* evidence and the detail can be a MeasureReport or GuidanceResponse, but if it is a MeasureReport, it must be the measure reported, which is the MeasureReport that is in context from the Composition section.</p>

<p>Yes</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It would mean the evidence detail for the DetectedIssue is communicated in 0 MeasureReports and 1 or more GuidanceResponses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it contains more than 1 MeasureReport, what would it mean?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may just be phrasing, but I don't think it can "contain more than 1 MeasureReport".  It could have multiple evidence details associated with the same ("measure reported") MeasureReport.  What that would mean is TBD.  I don't have an example of what information one might communicate that way.  I'm just saying  I don't feel confident there is nothing anyone would ever want to communicate that way so let's not intentionally preclude it.</p>

<p>The latter, since there is one "gap" that can be closed in multiple different ways. There would be two guidance responses contained in that detected issue, one for colonoscopy and one for blood test</p>

<p>One think I would mention related to that though is that, in the interest of modeling intentionally (instead of by inference), the DetectedIssue can be of type "closed-gap".  So</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you resolve one of them, one DetectedIssue would go away, but the other would remain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>becomes: <br>
If you resolve one of them, one DetectedIssue becomes a "closed-gap", but the other would remain (an "open-gap").</p>

Would it make sense to put the DetectedIssue resources in the 'focus' in the Composition resource? A few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The operation is $care-gaps, implying the intent to get care gaps and corresponding guidance to close any open gaps.</li>
<li>There could be a DetectedIssue resource which may not point to any MeasureReport.</li>
<li>There could be a DetectedIssue resource which may point to multiple MeasureReport resources. May be closing this one gap addresses the numerators of multiple measures.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, could we allow more valid values for the status in DetectedIssue, like when the gap is no longer valid when the patient is excluded from the member or loses coverage or some other reason.</p>
