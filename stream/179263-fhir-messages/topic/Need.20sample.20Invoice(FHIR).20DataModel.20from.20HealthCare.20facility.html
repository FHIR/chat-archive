<p>I am trying to implement a Datamodel for our company using Invoice FHIR data structure.<br>
<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/invoice.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/invoice.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/invoice.html</a><br>
<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/invoice-example.json.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/invoice-example.json.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/invoice-example.json.html</a></p>
<p>We specifically want to see a Invoice sample/example from a Provider or Nursing Home/Homecare facility who currently uses FHIR Datamodel.<br>
There are couple of queries that I currently have:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is only one tag for date field.<br>
"date" : "&lt;dateTime&gt;", // Invoice date / posting date<br>
  If the services availed by an insured is two weeks, how does a provider/facility send this two weeks date range through this Invoice model?  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the provider/facility calculates average daily amount for the service on day basis and sends 14 Invoices corresponding to each day of the service availed ?</p>
</li>
<li>Is there a provision to include net amt/gross amount on hourly basis alongside with option to have date ranges?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for any information you provide. Please let me know if this post needs to goto another stream.</p>

<p>Hi Raj, I'm afraid this question is out of scope for this specific message channel (Messaging), best to ask either the 'implementers' or the 'patient administration WG' channels. That will increase the chances of someone answering your question.</p>
