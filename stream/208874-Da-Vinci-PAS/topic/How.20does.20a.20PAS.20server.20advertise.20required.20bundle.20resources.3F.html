<p>In order for a DTR client to assemble the set of resources required by a PAS server, how is it supposed to discover these required resources?   I've been looking through the PASBundle profile and it seems like it only requires a Claim.   I'm assuming though that a PAS Server, on behalf of a payer, will require more than that so how does the DTR client discover this?</p>

<p>The only mandatory entry is a Claim resource.  Various references are probably also required, but the exact number of those isn't known at design time.  We could add Organization, Coverage, Patient to the slices because those will normally be there, but they would be optional slices, so I'm not sure that gives you the entire information you would need.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192166">@Jean Duteau</span>  OK, that makes sense (Claim only req'd one according to the profile).   I guess my question is, if a payer's PAS server wanted to 'advertise' what resources they expect, is there a way to do that (in a computable format not via out-of-band contractual arrangement)? </p>
<p>Or to illustrate a problem -- if my system, a DTR client, doesn't know that the PAS server requires certain resources in order to approve the request, it can't know a-priori, what resources to bundle up to meet the payer's requirements.</p>
