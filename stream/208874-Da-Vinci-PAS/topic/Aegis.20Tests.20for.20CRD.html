<p>For those of us testing for HIMSS, it would really be helpful if we knew the official test scripts to execute for each of the steps on PAS (including the sub-steps such as CRD). We have been going through Touchstone’s huge test scripts directory but we need a PAS/CRD/DTR mapping of script to interaction.  An example of an issue we are having is that we are using ‘order-sign’ which is per the spec but the script in Touchstone wants ‘medication-prescribe’.  It could be that we are simply not running the right scripts.  This may already exist and I am not aware…</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that the <code>medication-prescribe</code> hook has been deprecated by CDS Hooks to better model real-world CPOE ordering workflow, which is not specific to meds, in <code>order-select</code> and <code>order-sign</code>.</p>
