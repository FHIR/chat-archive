<p>The information in the Encounter row is intended to provide context on the visit that led to the Referral.In most circumstances, the referring system will not track planned encounters at a granular level, particularly if they are occurring in a different organization.<br>
DECISION:  The visit resulting in the Referral should be documented in the componentOf/encompassingEncounter in CDA (and appropriate constraints should be included in the design).  This encounter information would be referenced in the ServiceRequest resource in FHIR, and included in the bundle as an Encounter resource.</p>

<p>I think the techie group did validate against SNODENT and ICD-10 yesterday, although I could have misunderstood what they said  with regard to validation.</p>

<p>Hi Greg, after you left the techie group discovered the validator wasn't working with SNODENT and ICD-10 codes.  So, we reached out to the implementation chat.  Hope to hear something today.  Looks like Grahame responded and the SNODENT codes need to be manually loaded to the HL7 terminology and this should work now.  ICD-10 may not work because of a licensing issue.</p>
