<p>Quote from MHD's "Open Issues and Questions":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MHD_048: We have chosen to define some secondary resources as ‘contained’, which in<br>
FHIR means that they would not standalone, and thus would not be revisable. We chose<br>
this characteristic as the closest to XDS metadata principle. However this means that<br>
225 these secondary resources would not be searchable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would suggest to define a profile on the Reference type and make populating the <code>display</code>element (e.g. with the author's name) mandatory.<br>
Also, whenever there are identifiers for these resources that are commonly understood within the domain - such as national identifiers for practitioners - Reference.identifier should also be populated. That way, at least a search by name and/or identifier could be supported, which probably covers &gt;80% of the usecases.</p>

<p>That might be a good 'best practice', but IHE has existing XD* profiles that don't have that requirement. Thus where the data is  stored in XDS, these best-practices can't be filled.   A secondary profile that further refines, seems like a useful way to convey these best-practices... Right?</p>

<p>Oh, since this was filed under "open issues and questions", I was under the impression that you were looking for a solution for this issue...</p>

<p>ah, well turns out they are searchable according to the STU3 specification. So I have an IHE CP to correct that and add the method of searching. This was one of the things we discovered at the FHIR Connectathon last.  <a href="https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2017/09/fhir-connectathon-of-ihe-mhd-profile.html" target="_blank" title="https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2017/09/fhir-connectathon-of-ihe-mhd-profile.html">https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2017/09/fhir-connectathon-of-ihe-mhd-profile.html</a></p>

<p>we are always looking for feedback, comments, and improvements... especially during "Trial Implementation".</p>
