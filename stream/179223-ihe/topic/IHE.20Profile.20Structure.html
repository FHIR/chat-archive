<p>We should have our Actors and Transactions as FHIR resources. Not sure where decisions last landed, but I think:<br>
Transactions - PlanDefinition<br>
Actors - Device? CapStatement?</p>

<p>I have been creating a CapabilityStatement for every Actor. This seems clear. One might have other CapabilityStatement for various options or other reasons, but there should be at-least ONE</p>

<p>I expect at-least ONE StructureDefinition for the "Message Encoding" sub-section in each IHE Transaction. Given that an IHE Transaction can be made up of 1..* messages. An important point is that the IHE Transaction structure is made up of three subsections, for which messge encoding is just one of them. The oters are "Trigger Event" and "Expected Action". These other two sub-sections don't have an obvious conformance resource.</p>

<p>The Transaction layout is being worked by some using Gherkin-- Given/When/Then which is much like Trigger-Event/Message-Encoding/Expected-Action. There is experimentation in IHE on two projects</p>

<p>I disagree with using PlanDefinition for this.  It's really meant to be used in a clinical context, where the plan is some sort of care/treatment plan that can be customized based on decision points.  The fact that it <strong> could be </strong> used for this purpose is inconsequential.  It's not really appropriate for this purpose.</p>

<p>I use capability statements to define actors.  A transaction imposes constraints on what needs to appear within a transaction on both sides of the transaction.  As John has noted, these could actually be described as constraints on the actor supplied CapabilityStatement Resource.</p>

<p>And probably my need for actor definitions is different. What I want is a governed repository of actor definitions (independent of options).<br>
I also want a repository of transactions (we're working on that in Belgium)<br>
And a repository of glossary terms (will be good to see where those sit)</p>

<p>To that end, there are some projects that we will each taken on that solve the same kind of problem differently. This is "Trial Implementation". So I encourage a few potential solutions, when there is potential. Hence why I am encouraging Cucumber experimentation too.</p>

<p>IHE does have that now.. The mechanics are just not well understood and well used... So, yes there is room for improvement and I very much agree. However in the context of a specific PROFILE the CapabilitySttement is the right way to give profile specific context. These are not two different things</p>

<p>I think most of what I indicated is manual and copy-paste.<br>
And in my vision, the different profiles will build up those assets - if a profile adds a term, or an actor, etc., I want the rest to be automated - publication, maintenance...</p>

<p>My thoughts on this: A CapabilityStatement is a statement of what a application or system supports.  A claim by an application or system to support an Actor reflects what should be seen in a CapabilityStatement, as does a separate claim to support a particular option for an actor.  Thus, each is a set of requirements  associated with an Actor, or an Option, and can be reported in a separate set of constraints on the CapabilityStatement resources exposed by that application or system.  They can be expressed as profiles on an Instance (CapabilityStatement.kind="instance"), and represented as independent capabilities (in a CapabilityStatement where kind="capability").  The former can be used for validation, the latter for expression of the capabiltiies, and the former (profiles) can be crafted from the latter.</p>

Gherkin - I think that conceptually, Gherkin corresponds to (a computable expression of) <strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong><br>

<p>the current use of Gherkin is simply as a means of expressing the expected tests that should be designed for the IHE-Connectathon. It is not a replacement for SHALL language or structureDefinitions. I expect the Gherkin will leverage the structureDefinitions at points of conformance checking.</p>

<p>No alternative, I just want to see what it is so that it fits in a structured model (and therefore in a more industrialized process). <br>
If they are acceptance criteria, they are related to requirements/user stories. The link to Connectathon is not a direct link, I think.</p>
<p>Example:<br>
"Given a patient exists on the system, when I try to create a new patient with the same ID, this should fail" <br>
or <br>
"Given a patient exists on the system, when I submit an updated patient record, then the server should result ..." </p>
<ul>
<li>these are <strong>Acceptance criteria</strong>, which belong to a <strong>User Story</strong>; this <strong>User Story</strong> is in the origin of <strong>Conformance Artifacts</strong> including the <strong>StructureDefs</strong>. In a <strong>Connectathon</strong> you may apply a <strong>test plan</strong> which includes the tests for a given set of <strong>criteria</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In the Gemini MDI project, we ended up utilizing Cucumber/Gherkin as a handy way of getting more precision in the story / use case / scenario specifications associated with an IHE Profile; however, we found that once you get much beyond that (e.g., linking them to test platforms, as Gherkin was designed to do), you quickly end up with more complexity than needed or wanted (esp. on the part of the SMEs describing the scenario logic.</p>
<p>So we will be using ReqIF (OMG spec supported by quite a few requirements management tools) to represent both Gherkin-based requirements as well as all other requirements, including from standards referenced in the IHE Profile.  </p>
<p>Stay tuned ... but we think it will get us to where we need to go, namely a CA  report of sufficient rigor that it can be directly included in regulatory submissions.</p>

<p>Yes, so we have a shiny new bus in the workshop, we can mess with that at will. And if your bus is rolling down the highway, and I understand we cannot slow down the bus, if you need to change the oil, what I'm trying to avoid is that you put gas in the oil compartment.</p>

<p>the use of Gherkin in IHE today is experimental, and may not be found to be useful. There is the use that I describe in the IPS, CCG, and MHD profiles. It is very minimal, it is an appendix. It is just as likely to be found unnecessary as it is to be found a distraction.</p>

<p>I hope I had not misdirected you to thinking it was more common when I asked if there was a way to have the IG publisher display .feature files. I asked only to see if there was something already done that can be directed to pull in TEXT files and display them inline, possibly as code blocks, etc.</p>

<p>Yes, we can display text files (or markdown, or diagrams). For that we need to build the template (not difficult) and for building the template we need to see what that template is about - i.e. we want to put text in what "type" of page? in the structuredef intro? in any random markdown? Or as part of a "requirements" section? Or as part of the "test" section? In either case, we need to know  which text to put where.<br>
I'm glad the call today helped clarify that.</p>

<p>you are a few steps beyond what I need today. I just need a way that a markdown page in an IG can include text from a named file. That named file happens to be a .feature file. But for my needs it could be anything. The alternative I have is to copy-paste it into the markdown, and thus have two instances of the text.. i am trying to avoid two copies of the same text.</p>

<p>you could try to <code>{% include yourfile.feature %}</code>inside your markdown</p>

<p>yourfile.feature would need to be in the ig's <code>input\images</code> folder</p>

<p>I probably did something wrong, but that didn't work. I think I followed instructions... this filename is right, and it exists in the images-source</p>

<p>it's a shot in the dar.. do you have a repo (i'm lazy to setup something from scratch)?)</p>
