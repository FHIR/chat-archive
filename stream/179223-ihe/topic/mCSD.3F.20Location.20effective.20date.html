<p>I have some use cases that require knowing the 'effective dates' of a Location - not just opening times. This can be 1) Location becomes inactive at a specific date (closes) or opens; 2) Location is temporary, like a school vaccination site; 3) A Location's managingOrganization changes on a date such as when administrative areas split or merge. </p>
<p>However, there's no such thing in the Location resource to have start/end dates. Is this a job for mCSD, extensions/profiling, or proposed change to FHIR itself? I could terribly off-course here, so any suggestions welcome. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193299">@Luke Duncan</span> Edit: I should probably add that this is more to be used in aggregate reporting by subnational units.</p>

<p>Perhaps Schedule may be a good place for this.  I'll bring this up on the next mCSD call as well to see if there is a better solution.</p>
