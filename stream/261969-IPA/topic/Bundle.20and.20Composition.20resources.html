<p>Hi,<br>
In our last call we discussed the need to include Bundle as supported resources in IPA. As far as I remember the outcome was that support for response Bundles is implied, as you can search.</p>
<p>How do we feel about the Composition resource? Given that we have <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/ccda-on-fhir/index.html">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/ccda-on-fhir/index.html</a>, it could be nice to support it. I see many areas benefiting from such an approach.</p>
<p>However, I'm not really pushing for it to be included in the base version of the IPA. We could also have a "CDA" profile building on top of IPA, and requiring support for the ccda-on-fhir IG.</p>

<p>I think Composition has a strong focus in IPS, wouldn't it make sense to leave it there?</p>

<p>Right, let's leave this to a IPS (or a C-CDA) profile building on top of the base IPA spec.</p>
