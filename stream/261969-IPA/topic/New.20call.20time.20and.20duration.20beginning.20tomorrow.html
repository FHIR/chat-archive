<p>This is a reminder/notification that we agreed last week to move our IPA call to a separate 60 min. call beginning at 10:00 AM EDT (14:00 UTC, 16:00 CEST).  The IPS call will be immediately following the IPA call at 11:00 AM EDT, also for 60 min.  I've made these adjustments on the HL7 Conference Call Center <a href="http://www.hl7.org/concalls/CallDetails.cfm?concall=56760">calendar</a>.  Since I did made these changes today the automatic reminder that was sent was for the previous combined call (beginning at 10:30), but future reminders will be sent correctly starting next week.</p>
