<p>Our server is still getting hit with a bunch of test suites that it doesn't claim support for (we had a few hundred requests for the Patient resource as recently as an hour or so ago). Is there any update on when 'supported only' will actually work?</p>

<p>This took issue took awhile to address, but I believe we fixed the problem.  A subset of our tests weren't reporting what resources they were testing, so filtering by 'supported only' wasn't working properly.  We deployed the fix last week, and it appears that it is behaving as expected now.</p>
