<p>Hi<br>
I was trying to install a local instance using docker in windows 10. Is it currently supported?<br>
I was confused since it threw a lot of errors while building i.e. <code>docker-compose build</code>.<br>
There were errors (or warnings maybe) about node 8, bower and many others...<br>
From the last output I assumed that it should be able to run, so tried <code>docker-compose up</code>.<br>
While mongo container seemed to be up, the web and tasks failed with following <code>standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused "no such file or directory"</code>.<br>
Any pointers would be helpful<br>
Thanks</p>
