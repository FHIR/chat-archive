<p>Hi! I just signed up for the FhirDevDays and as this is our first visit to this kind of conference I have a question. If I have a very specific question (e.g. how do I best map our internal model to FHIR object XXXX), what is the best way to go about this? In what forum should I post this type of question?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="364590">@Håkan MacLean</span> Welcome! And Jose is right, <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179166" href="/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers">#implementers</a> is the best starting place for any FHIR implementtain question. And people will point you to more specific channels if needed from there.</p>

<p>Let me check, as I at this stage, I cannot see the links either.</p>
<p>Where did you add it, as on the backend side, I did not see it.</p>
