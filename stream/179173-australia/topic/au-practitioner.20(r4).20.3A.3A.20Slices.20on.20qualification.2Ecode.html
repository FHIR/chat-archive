<p>Agency when deriving au-practitioner profile to create an Agency practitioner profile thought of a need for two slices for qualification.code to suit HL7 (example) valueset and Australian Localisation valuesSet as the existing HL7 example valueSet (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/v2/0360/2.7/index.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/v2/0360/2.7/index.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/v2/0360/2.7/index.html</a>) from FHIR does not really capture some key Australian qualifications such as AHPRA and MBBS.</p>
<p>CI team from Australian Digital Health Agency have requested NCTS to add a valueSet to cater for Australian localisation of Qualification code in au-practitioner profile preferably from SNOMED.</p>
<p>A request has been made to include the following two codes as a minimum in the valueSet</p>
<p>AHPRA</p>
<p>MBBS</p>
<p>A second query is that, is it reasonable to have codes from <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1220.0" target="_blank" title="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1220.0">http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1220.0</a> for qualification.code in au-practitioner as well ?</p>
