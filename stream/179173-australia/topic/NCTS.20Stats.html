<p>Odd question, wondering if any of the NCTS folks would have the summary details of how many terms were updated as part of the last update to the AMT?  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191337">@Dion McMurtrie</span> <br>
i.e. Number of additions/changes/removals</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191367">@Brian Postlethwaite</span>, not sure if this is what you mean but there were 191 new CTPPs added in last month's release and 5 were retired and replaced. That's opposed to 325 (including the 191) which were modified in some way last release (e.g. may have been new or just had their name altered in some way but weren't retired) <a href="https://browse.medserve.online/?q=type%3ACTPP%20status%3Aactive%20modified-from%3A2019-01-31%20modified-to%3A2019-01-31" target="_blank" title="https://browse.medserve.online/?q=type%3ACTPP%20status%3Aactive%20modified-from%3A2019-01-31%20modified-to%3A2019-01-31">https://browse.medserve.online/?q=type%3ACTPP%20status%3Aactive%20modified-from%3A2019-01-31%20modified-to%3A2019-01-31</a> or <a href="https://browse.medserve.online/?q=type%3ACTPP%20status%3Aentered-in-error%20modified-from%3A2019-01-31%20modified-to%3A2019-01-31" target="_blank" title="https://browse.medserve.online/?q=type%3ACTPP%20status%3Aentered-in-error%20modified-from%3A2019-01-31%20modified-to%3A2019-01-31">https://browse.medserve.online/?q=type%3ACTPP%20status%3Aentered-in-error%20modified-from%3A2019-01-31%20modified-to%3A2019-01-31</a> shows you the 5 that were replaced.</p>
<p>I've got an outstanding task to make the 191 visible as opposed to the 325 via that Medserve API, but I haven't done that yet...sorry.</p>
<p>Was that the sort of thing you were looking for? Obviously there were changes to other types of AMT concepts too.</p>

<p>That's awesome, and EXACTLY what I was looking for!</p>

<p>Good, I'm glad. <a href="https://browse.medserve.online" target="_blank" title="https://browse.medserve.online">https://browse.medserve.online</a> can show you a few things like that. A fair chunk of the search API of Medserve is exposed via the browser, but there's more and you can be quite specific. It is just an extended set of search parameters for the Medication resource where AMT is exposed as a big set of Medication resources. Check out the response resources, all the detail of the AMT concepts are represented in the Medication resources so you can pick out ingredients, strengths, pack sizes...etc...<br>
If you can't find what you want through the browser let me know, you might be able to get what you want from the API from <a href="https://medserve.online/fhir/" target="_blank" title="https://medserve.online/fhir/">https://medserve.online/fhir/</a> ...and I can try and add anything that you might need that's missing.</p>

<p>That's the kind of useful stuff that might be published in a release note on a web page (in HTML, <em>not</em> PDF) :-)</p>
