<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191337">@Dion McMurtrie</span> A question from the NZF Team, does the Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary use AMT codes and are there any plans to expose some of its functionality via a FHIR-based API?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191364">@Peter Jordan</span>, the Australian Pharmaceutical Formulary is a book (and eBook I think) - is that what you mean? We've talked to them and there's been some preliminary/trial mapping exercises with AMT, but I think they were still trying to figure out the business model to cover the costs of maintaining something like that. We've also worked with them on developing CALS (cautionary and advisory labels).</p>
<p>But as far as I know there's no official plans yet to for the APF to use AMT codes or expose anything using FHIR.</p>
<p>Did you have anything in particular in mind?</p>
