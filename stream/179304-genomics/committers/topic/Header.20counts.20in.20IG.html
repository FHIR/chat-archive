<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  - Tagging you to get some input.  The headers on our pages are not correct.  Most pages have a counter, but they are not correct.  I did some investigation, and even tried changing some things in the framework directory, and I made some things better but others worse.  I even tried syncing up our framework folder with the sdc IG framework folder in case something got out of sync.  But no change.</p>
<p>I have to admit to not being a CSS expert.  Any chance  you could take a look?</p>
