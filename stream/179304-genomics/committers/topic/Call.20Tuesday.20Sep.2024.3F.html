<p>Calling all committers to the genomics-reporting IG.  I know we typically don't have our calls the week after the WGM, but I would like to propose we have a call and working session during our normal time on Tuesday, Sep 24.  We can talk through a plan to publish.  Please respond here if you are interested.</p>

<p>I really missed it. Didn't I...Okay. as stated elsewhere the only thing on my todo list is the query example page. I'll submit a merge request very soon (6 to 8 hours).. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191451">@Patrick Werner</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196553">@James Jones</span> we still looking at version 0.9 followed by version 1.0 the difference being additional text on the header of important profiles? e.g. on variant, to borrow Jamie's nomenclature, I was planning statement such as 'The profile here is meant to convey the sequence details of the variant. For HGVS three components are available depending on the source molecule. If ....' intending to be redundant with the glossary and background. (PS I'm not worried about the time for writings sake. I spun off a 30 page IRB proposal in 6 hours, the header sections will be finished soon. But we need time to run the wording past the WG).</p>

<p>In terms of freezing a 0.9 version and going over the wording with technical writers before publishing a 1.0, this hasn't been widely discussed yet.</p>

<p>FYI: It was discussed that more technical writing could be useful to implementers. I'll send out drafts for the WG to comment on. These are not to hold up our publication - but as they are editorial in nature and do not change the structure, only adding text to aid implementers, Jaime, Patrick and I thought about doing a second publication quickly after the first to include the text. But it will take a bit before the WG approves the text. No official action or gefore tracker.</p>
