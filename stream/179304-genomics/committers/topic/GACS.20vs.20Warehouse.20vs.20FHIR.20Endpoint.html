<p>Every time i hear GACS it makes me wince. I still don't really like the term as it confuses the implementer. <br>
In the end we have FHIR Endpoints, thats it. If there is a Facade behind it, a VCF sore being analyzed real time or a plain hapi server.</p>

<p>GACS is a term related to PACS. Is there a particular reason that it is confusing?</p>

<p>Yes, people new to genomics are getting confused. They wonder where to get a GACS, is it Standards based?<br>
Does it use FHIR? <br>
Tbh i don't see value in calling it GACS, its just an CG IG complient FHIR Endpoint.</p>

<p>yeah. we could use a more generic term as well. There are a few publications out there on it. GACS is an architectural design choice . Its well known in some circles and is a name meant to appeal to the clinical laboratory professionals (not more generalized developers). Fair point on the confusion. But it is a reasonable term to use in the genomics space. hmm...do we use the term a  lot in guidance? perhaps we need to define it somewhere visible?</p>

<p>what do you think?</p>

<p>I think the group should communicate such things in a coordinated manner. The push for this term was not well communicated in this group i guess. <br>
I agree, now the term is out there, and i see the PACS analogy. <br>
Maybe a section in the IG about GACS could be helpful?</p>

<p>So people understand that a GACS is not black magic, its just a FHIR Endpoint, using our IG, Facading more or less raw genomic data</p>

<p>Might be a good subsection for operations.html</p>
