<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196553">@James Jones</span>  - I had logged <a href="https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=19214" target="_blank" title="https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=19214">GF#19214</a> for the finalized changes to the Genomics Background (PKA Genomics Primer) page.  I realize now that when reviewing the WGM minutes, we never actually voted on the changes, so we should likely add this to our Tuesday agenda?  Unless I am missing something?</p>

<p>You're right, this specific tracker wasn't cited in the WGM to vote on... I made the updates per the resolutions to 16254, 16255, 16256, 16686, and 16712 in that section that were already voted on, but 19214 can cover the changes not specifically mentioned in the others. Shall I mark 19214 as pre-applied?</p>

<p>If those are the ones logged by Clem, per his request at the WGM, I marked them as Retracted.</p>
