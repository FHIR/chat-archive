<p>I logged the following JIRA, proposing the lower the binding strength we have on HGVS components. I made this suggestion to get rid of a class of QA errors being generated since we have it as REQUIRED today. Since HGVS isn't a supported terminology, all examples that include HGVS throw QA errors. </p>

<p>Just FYI - This isn't needed after all.  The examples that were failing for a different reason, and someone (me) didn't read the error closely enough. <span aria-label="frown" class="emoji emoji-1f641" role="img" title="frown">:frown:</span> So I have withdrawn the JIRA.</p>
