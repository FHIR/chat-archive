<p>schneems opened <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/134" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/134">PR #134</a><br>
from <code>schneems/codetriage-badge</code> to <code>master</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.codetriage.com/" target="_blank" title="https://www.codetriage.com/">CodeTriage</a> is an app I have maintained<br>
for the past 4-5 years with the goal of getting people involved in<br>
Open Source projects like this one. The app sends subscribers a random<br>
open issue for them to help "triage". For some languages you can also<br>
suggested areas to add documentation.</p>
<p>The initial approach was inspired by seeing the work of the small<br>
core team spending countless hours asking "what version was<br>
this in" and "can you give us an example app". The idea is to<br>
outsource these small interactions to a huge team of volunteers<br>
and let the core team focus on their work.</p>
<p>I want to add a badge to the README of this project. The idea is to<br>
provide an easy link for people to get started contributing to this<br>
project. A badge indicates the number of people currently subscribed<br>
to help the repo. The color is based off of open issues in the project.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of other projects that have a badge in their<br>
README:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal">https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/rails/rails">https://github.com/rails/rails</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage">https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for building open source software, I would love to help you find some helpers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I appreciate you trying to build awareness for your product, @schneems. The future contributors we need for this project are focused in the healthcare interoperability standards rather than any developer wanting to look to get involved on an open source project.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, what script did you write that identified the ~200 repositories that which you thought were candidates for your product? Just wondering.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CodeTriage is not a tool for random developers to help random repos, it’s a tool for people who are explicitly interested in helping your repo do so in an easy and approachable manner. Though if you’re not really using issues or pull requests then it won’t be helpful to them.</p>
<p>Regarding “how did I pick this one?”: Someone added your repo to CodeTriage. They are already using it for your repo so i figured it would be a good fit. Theres currently 23,000 devs signed up to help 2,800 repos and yours is one of them.</p>
