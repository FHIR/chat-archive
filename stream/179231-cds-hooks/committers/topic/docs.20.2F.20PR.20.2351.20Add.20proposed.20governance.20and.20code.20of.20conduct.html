from <code>governance</code> to <code>master</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This work is a joint collaboration between <span class="user-mention" data-user-email="jmandel@gmail.com" data-user-id="9">@Josh Mandel</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-email="isaacvetter@gmail.com" data-user-id="558">@Isaac Vetter</span>, @brynrhodes, @mattberther, and myself. Thanks to many others who reviewed a draft of this proposed governance model and provided feedback.</p>
<p>As CDS Hooks matures as a community and standard, we feel it is important to formalize our governance process and establish a code of conduct. This will ensure that we all work in the same manner and have clear expectations for how we work.</p>
<p>Feedback and comments from everyone is welcome.</p>
<p>I will have an update for this pull request where both the governance and code of conduct are referenced in the homepage.</p>
