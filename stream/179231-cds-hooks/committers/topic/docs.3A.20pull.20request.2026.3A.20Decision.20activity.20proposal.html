<blockquote>
<p>This implements point 3 from <a href="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues/18#issuecomment-282141134" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues/18#issuecomment-282141134">https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues/18#issuecomment-282141134</a></p>
<p>This adds a new concept to the decision return from CDS service to hint at a subsequent action and related resources. This also generalizes the name of "hook catalog" to be called "activity catalog", as it serves as describing actions, of which could be used as web hooks.</p>

<p>Thanks @bkaney! I think the key contributions here are:</p>
<p>1. Generalizing the activities catalog to work in both directions: an EHR can tell a service "hey, the user is doing this activity", and an app can tell the EHR "hey, here's a good activity for the user to do next". </p>
<p>2. Updating the decision data model to support this communication back to the EHR</p>
<p>I'm definitely in favor.</p>
<p>I noticed, in the process, that our docs for <code>decisions.create</code> are missing something: they specify a list of ids, but what we actually need (and the way our test implementations work) is a list of resources. Does this match your expectations?</p>

<p>Yea, they could be resources. However, as we aren't the FHIR server persisting the resource, we'd have to figure out a way to reference them (in the <code>actions</code> structure). Perhaps the CDS service would mint an ID for each resource and use #anchor-tag style contained reference?</p>
