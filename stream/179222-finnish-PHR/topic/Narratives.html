<p>Hi, I got review feedback for the Activity and exercise profile regarding new additions to the base profile and thus to all derived ones. One of them is the mandatory narrative at observation.text element - reviewers apparently ask for narrative guidance from the profile authors. I must say I’m lost here - I would expect to get the narrative related guidance from Kela.  So can someone explain what is intended purpose of these narratives at the PHR? Then I’ll be able to reflect that on the guidance to be provided. Thanks!</p>

<p>As My Kanta Pages PHR is a national database and different applications may utilize all resources stored in PHR, it is important that the narrative of the resource includes a human-readable summary of the content of the resource, as the FHIR standard states (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/domainresource-definitions.html#DomainResource.text" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/domainresource-definitions.html#DomainResource.text">http://hl7.org/fhir/domainresource-definitions.html#DomainResource.text</a>, <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/narrative.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/narrative.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/narrative.html</a>). In addition, the narrative of a resource will be shown in Omakanta when the citizen browses his/her resources stored in My Kanta Pages PHR.</p>
<p>We encourage the creators' of the profiles to define the content that should be represented in the narrative, as you have the best knowledge of the use of the profile and the data stored in resources conforming to the profile.</p>
