<p>Hi! I tried loading the FHIR conformance statement from /metadata in the sandbox and noticed that in the non-authenticating sandbox the URL times out (no response within 30 seconds) and in the authenticating sandbox the URL requires authentication before it can be loaded. Is this intentional? AFAIK the conformance statement is usually loadable at all times without authentication.</p>

<p>Hi! That is intentional. You can find the released version of conformance statement from Simplifier:  <a href="https://simplifier.net/finnishphr/~resources?category=CapabilityStatement" target="_blank" title="https://simplifier.net/finnishphr/~resources?category=CapabilityStatement">https://simplifier.net/finnishphr/~resources?category=CapabilityStatement</a> <br>

<p>Ok. Looks like multiple available FHIR libraries / example code expects the statement to be loadable at all times (which does seem to be the case on all other FHIR servers I've used so far), which makes it harder to work against the FIPHR server as it's behavior is in a way "non-standard". Similarly the REST API seems to be hardcoded to always return the "minimal" operation outcome reporting, where other servers seem to default to  the "representation" mode where the object used in the CRUD operation is returned. Related, on FIPHR the the "Prefer:" header on REST CRUD operations from the client is ignored (see "Managing Return Content" in the STU3 REST spec at <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/http.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/http.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/http.html</a>). This also broke the libraries I'm using and is causing additional load on the server and client as I now need issue another request to load the just created resource instead of adding a "Prefer: return=representation" header to the initial CRUD operation.</p>

<p>A related discussion is <a href="#narrow/stream/179222-finnish-PHR/topic/Server.20metadata/near/153970599" title="#narrow/stream/179222-finnish-PHR/topic/Server.20metadata/near/153970599">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179222-finnish-PHR/topic/Server.20metadata/near/153970599</a>. I also think the data should be publicly accessible. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194257">@Juha Paasolainen</span> are you able to elaborate on why it is not?</p>
