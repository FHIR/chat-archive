<p>Hi! Looks like the MedicationAdministration record type doesn't have support for filtering data using the medication code in FIPHR, which would be very useful for developers - without the medication code query support the only way to load medication events of certain medication code is to load all records using the patient ID and filtering programmatically, which is not optimal. Additionally, being able to provide a list of codes would be handy. (Edited the message, cannot reproduce the other issue.)</p>

<p>Hi, it's on our work list to support searching for MedicationAdministrations by code parameter, I'll try to get it included in our autumn release of the platform. </p>
<p>About the list of codes, just to make sure I understood you correctly, do you mean you would like to be able to get from the Kanta PHR platform a list of codes included in the MedicationAdministration resources of a single patient?</p>
