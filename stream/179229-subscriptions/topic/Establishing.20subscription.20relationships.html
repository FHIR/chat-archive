<ol>
<li>For a lot of subscription use cases, the subscription depends on the existence of a group.  Has anyone done any thinking on how these groups are to be created?<br>
1.a. The group could define patients who might in the future develop a relationship with a facility, but who do not have one existing today.  For example, when I worked in downtown Boston, the closest ED would be where I would have been sent in case of an emergency health issue.  How would my PCP describe me to that facility?  Has anyone thought about this case?<br>
1.b. On the flip side, how would my PCP know to establish a relationship with that ED?  Geography wrt Patient Home/Work address seems like an obvious piece of data that might help with this, how would a group be defined to address this aspect?<br>
1.c. Would there be a way to define a group where some sort of treatment relationship is specified via some sort of MPI or other solution?</li>
</ol>
<p>This seems like a big gap in current subscription work, and I'm guessing it's been put out of scope in the current efforts.  Would that be a correct statement?  Is there future work envisioned in this space?</p>

<p>Group management touches a variety of other areas - at least Group/$export, search by group membership, and potentially managing access control in some applications. I wouldn't expect it to be in scope for subscription work specifically.</p>
