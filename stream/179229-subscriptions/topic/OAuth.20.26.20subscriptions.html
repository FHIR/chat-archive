<p>Da Vinci is looking at using Subscription as a way to indicate that a response is ready (and so to come and get the result). We had a question about whether an OAuth token would be needed to establish the subscription and whether the OAuth token would need to still be valid for the subscription notification</p>

<ul>
<li>An OAuth token should definitely be required to establish a subscription</li>
<li>Authn for the subscription notification is murky. The simple technical/security approach is to use a <code>[channel.payload.content](http://build.fhir.org/subscription)</code> of either <code>empty</code> or <code>id-only</code>. (Meaning that an OAuth token would be required to retrieve PHI).</li>

<p>Ultimately, the perception is that anOAuth token is trivial to acquire using the SMART Backend Services/OAuth2 client credentials flow in B2b scenarios and therefore we shouldn't shy aware from it.</p>

<p>The backend services OAuth doesn't involve any patient authorization though.  So the question is: once a patient gives authorization for data to flow, when does it time out (or how does a patient cancel it)?</p>

<p>Lloyd, apologies, I didn't understand that this was a patient-mediated flow. Generally, the same advice applies --</p>
<ul>
<li>An OAuth token should definitely be required to establish a subscription</li>
<li>A "callback" following a subscription notification would require patient authorization. Patient authorized apps will have long-term OAuth refresh tokens and patient portals should provide the ability for patients to revoke authorization.</li>

<p>It's probably not realistic for the patient to be involved on an ongoing basis, so some third party would have to manage renewing the token on the patient's behalf.</p>

<p>I am not sure I understand the full impact, it is Murky...   A Subscription involves three legs, yet  I see only two being discussed so I am not sure if the second or third leg is being forgotten (or assumed to be okay).  ( 1 ) request to subscribe, ( 2 ) notification, and ( 3 ) get of new data.  There are subscription types that combine 2 and 3; that if that is what you are talking about then that needs to be discussed.</p>

<p>The act of subscribing seems clear, but is not universally understood.  The discussion around subscription usually does need to address the time-to-live difference between the token at subscription from how long the subscription stays active. This is usually resolved in that the request to subscribe is/was valid at the time the request was made, so all parameters of the subscription must be checked at that time. This check needs to also involve the notification pathway mechanics. This is not obvious to everyone, so does need to be expressed.</p>

<p>The notification, if only a notification, can be risk-assessed to not need client authentication at all. As ( a ) the subscription said to use that notification mechanics, and ( b ) as purely a notification does not include any data outside the fact that something happened.</p>

<p>I'll preface with a note that I don't feel this area is fully resolved.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span>, the three legs you specify do cover the basic flow.  That said, there is sometimes a request for security on the second leg.  So far, the approach has been to add an <code>Auth</code> header to a Subscription, which is passed along with notifications (e.g., so a destination can validate the notification is genuine).<br>
It has some as-yet-unresolved issues (e.g., who can read/write the header, etc.), but does allow for basic validation on the notification (which could also be achieved with a parameter in the URL, but we felt this was more explicit).<br>
As for the notification pathway, that is checked at the time a <a href="http://build.fhir.org/subscription.html#rest-hook" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/subscription.html#rest-hook">REST-hook</a> subscription is created (e.g., set to requested and checked before being moved to active).  Is there more clarity/description necessary there, or are you thinking of something else?<br>
For other channels (e.g., websocket, email, etc.), the process would be different and we will likely punt to an implementer on what their process is (e.g., send an email asking to verify the address, ask the client to make a connection, or just move to active, etc. - just require it is described somewhere).</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>, for renewing the token - our current recommendation is to use the <code>Subscription.end</code> field to time-out subscriptions (e.g., a Must Support for the Argonaut IG).  If the subscription should be renewed, someone with the proper authorization needs to update the record with a new <code>end</code> date/time.  This allows for an interested application to confirm that the user still wants the subscription active and there is no need for managing a refresh token on behalf of the user.  Is this enough functionality, or is there something missing?</p>

<p>I think the desired from the patient's perspective is that they're involved in the initial authorization and that the patient doesn't have to do anything unless they want the authorization to end.  If they want the authorization to end, they would interact with one of the systems and subsequent requests would fail.</p>

<p>The patient would not <em>need</em> to be involved, as long as the application managing the subscription had a token.  It would just be maintenance that an application would need to do (and conversely, if the patient wanted to stop receiving notifications, the application could go an disable/delete the subscription).</p>

<p>The use-case isn't a patient receiving notifications.  This is a patient authorizing data to flow from system A to B.  Essentially the patient needs to be involved in turning on the switch, after which the subscription should function either until a pre-determined end point (6 months, 1 year) or until the patient decides to end it sooner.</p>

<p>There's two paths to revocation, I think:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a patient trusts system B to revoke its own access, they just indicate to System B that they want it to stop all access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise a patient uses system A's portal to review current access grants, and revoke (each patient portal has functionality like this built-in). After revocation, system A should stop allowing system B to access the patient's data.</p>
</li>

<p>the standards based model I heard explained is to revoke authorization at the oauth authority (which is usually a browser experience the patient has, call this a portal if you want, but humans must interact at the html level, not at the oauth transaction level), which relies on the notifiying app always having to renew the token prior to notification. That is the standards model... right?</p>

<p>I believe what Josh is referring to is standard auth revocation...  Whatever application was used to create the subscription can disable/delete a subscription on behalf of its user on its way out.  If a user is requesting that in the app, it should honor that request.  This would be the 'best' way, since it is the only process that allows every party to know that a subscription was removed and clean up their resources immediately.</p>
<p>If the user no longer wants to use the app even to delete access, then the user would need to use some other interface (e.g., the EHR portal, another app which can manage access, etc.) to revoke access.</p>
<p>In the cases where notifications do not contain PHI, removing the client is sufficient since the application will no longer be able to resolve a notification into anything useful.  In time, the server will remove the subscription as well, which disables even the 'clean' notifications.</p>
<p>In the cases where a subscription notification contains PHI (e.g., full-resource), then there is currently no way to know that a subscription was created by a specific client and should be removed.  I would assume that a portal could ask about items like that (e.g., you are revoking access, is there anything else that needs to be cleaned up), but it hasn't come up to my knowledge.</p>
<p>If you are asking about adding something to link a subscription to the client which created it, I'm happy to bring it up for discussion.  We do have to be careful of putting fields on the subscription with things like 'which client created this' since knowing client IDs makes <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/" target="_blank" title="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/">phishing attacks easier</a>.</p>
<p>I feel like anything more than having the ID would be beyond the scope of subscriptions (and into security).</p>
<p>Or, are you asking for clarifying/guidance text on the issue to be included on this topic?</p>

<p>This has not been discussed (to my knowledge).  Adding this to the workflow would require servers save the refresh token, which also has security implications (e.g., can other users read my subscription and now impersonate me).</p>

<p>you do not need (and should not) save the refresh token INSIDE the subscripiton resource. You save it someplace safe... that is to say I am assuming good systems design and that you are truely a confidential client (as a subscripiton manager server)</p>

<p>Yes, had a discussion offline here with Josh, and here's what we're leaning towards.</p>
<p>In the Subscription spec, put a notice in the Security section that:<br>
- Auth should be checked prior to sending a notification<br>
- Client ID / access tokens / refresh tokens / etc. cannot be stored in the subscription resource</p>
<p>In the Argonaut IG, we will draft out more of a workflow showing how an EHR can actually do this (e.g., when the subscription is created, track the client / user id in a secure manner, then validate prior to sending out a notification that the client and user are still valid, finally, when access is revoked, the subscription should be removed, etc.).</p>
<p>How does that sound?</p>

<p>messaging is more complex: messaging could be simple system-to-system messaging security; but I presume you want more specifics there too... seems an opportunity that needs a general solution... one general solution where message target is a user and not just an organization is just like rest-hook... as a message can be pushed just like anything can be pushed. All push models presume some pre-known knowledge on the target based on some trust-framework, so all start with a trust-framework... yeah, all possible models of complexity are in messaging without some trust-framework constraint.</p>

<p>for example IHE used subscription for functionality similar to HL7 v2 ADT... the notification was defined to be messaging, and the security model is either system-to-system (TLS), system-to-system (OAuth), or SMART.    Given it was messaging, it is less likely anyone would try to group with SMART and have an interactive session on the notification transaction. Thus it is likely to be OAuth re-directed to a null endpoint and thus not authorized.</p>

<p>For your use-case where you are pushing the content in a FHIR Message, this is about all you can expect. The push of the FHIR Message would setup a security context for that messaging channel. Might be system-to-system using mutually-authenticated-TLS (Yes, this is very likely in organization to organization, where they already use this for v2 and soap). That is likely to not be a happy-path, so you want to use OAuth on the client, but OAuth can also be organizational (like bulk-data has spec). I would NOT expect this flow to use the user identity from the subscription requst, that is just strange, and requires so many bad security decisions.</p>

<p>Yes.  In the R5 redesign, those are all still possible.  The specification allows for extensible channels, so any not already defined (REST-Hook, WebSocket, email) can be added (or if you want different behavior, define a new channel that uses the same type of channel).  Many of the security details depend on the channel layer, so are out of scope for either the core spec or the Argonaut IG.  Some of those could be notes in the area of  channel extensions (e.g., here are some security issues to consider when making a new channel).</p>
<p>That said, I am hearing that there should be <em>some</em> expected behaviors for a subscription regardless of what the channel-specific details are.</p>
<p>For me, I am actively drafting changes for each of those documents, so if there's feedback on what makes sense I can add some text to the pass for review.  Right now, there is nothing in either.  I feel that there is consensus that there needs to be more than nothing, so I am trying to figure out what that looks like.</p>

<p>How so (asking for clarification)?  If a client is authorized to create a subscription for a patient/group/resource/etc, the server tracking that information and validating it is still true before sending a notification doesn't feel wrong to me in any context.  What am I missing?</p>

<p>I don't think this has been proposed here (or if it has, I cannot see it).<br>
The user/app which has received the notification would need to authenticate to perform its query the same way it would for any other query.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the challenges we are working to resolve.  Websockets are often not part of 'normal client side security', and even when they are still face issues like revocation (e.g., was valid when I opened my socket, not anymore).  It's a complicated issue that I don't think has enough real-world experience to check off yet.</p>

<p>I guess from my perspective, the model is something like: each Subscription is created in the context of a specific authorization (knowable at creation time by looking at the access token used to create it). If that authorization is subsequently revoked for any reason, how do we make sure this propagates to subscription notifications?</p>

<p>Are you saying there's <em>one</em> subscription here for the whole family, like "All encounters for Patient 123,456,789"? If so, then either you created it, or your husband created it. If the creator revokes MyCoolPhoneApp's access, then the subscription should stop working. I might not be understanding your example , though.</p>

<p>So far, if we're assuming this is something the server takes on, it will also have implications/limitations on how the client app will need to behave. I'm trying to find a "not surprising behavior" middle ground</p>

<p>Jenni Syed: If, however, we tie it to the refresh token in play when the subscription is created, that implies that all 10 instances of the app for me would need to create and manage a unique subscription</p>

<p>I'm not sure I agree; the decision about how many endpoints to create and how many Subscriptions to create is up to the client. (But of course, the client must have permissions to create the Subscription, and must be prepared to deal with the consequences of revocation.)</p>

<p>On the revocations side, there's a spectrum of "conservative" things you could do to handle revocations (which presumable are relatively infrequent events, compared with approvals). I wouldn't want to specify too much about how this works.. but internally you might have a rule like "any time a user revokes any access from an app, all of the Subscriptions for that {app, user} are set to <code>inactive</code>."  That's "conservative" because it might invalidate some subscriptions that don't <em>need</em> to be, but an app may be able to come back and re-enable them in response, after seeing missed heartbeats. (If you can fine-tune the inactivations, so much the better.)</p>

<p>I see this as a tuple for the authorization - a user and an app (acting on behalf of that user).</p>
<p>If a user account responsible for a subscription is disabled, I would expect notifications to halt.<br>
If a user revokes access for an application, I would expect notifications to halt.</p>
<p>In the 'MyCoolPhoneApp' scenario, if the application is consolidating subscriptions and rebroadcasting (users 'A' and 'B' are linked in the app):</p>
<ol>
<li>'A' creates subscription, 'MyCoolPhoneApp' access revoked on the EHR, no more notifications (feels fair)</li>
<li>'A' creates subscription, 'B' revokes access for 'A' on the EHR, no more notifications (feels fair, 'B' needs to setup a subscription)</li>
<li>'A' creates subscription, 'A' revokes access for 'B' on the EHR, 'MyCoolPhoneApp' still sharing (accounts were linked in the app, need to manage in app, feels fair)</li>
</ol>
<p>There could be some confusion around 2., in that 'B' may not remember that 'A' was the primary user and revoking their access disabled the subscription, but I (personally) feel like this is a fair process (or at least better than arbitrarily allowing 'A' to continue receiving notifications).</p>
<p>I am confused about your comment about tying it to the patient id (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191356">@Jenni Syed</span>).  Isn't this process for evaluating access to a resource 'owned' by a patient based on the other two (e.g., this notification is for 'patient/123', does user 'A':'MyCoolPhoneApp' have access)?</p>

<p>That makes sense.

Or something like a check that runs once per hour (a delay in revocation would be expected in my mind) to disable a subscription, etc.?</p>

<p>Yep.  These are all difficult/tedious to work through.  I guess my preference would be for us to set out some basic expected behaviors as guidelines, and go from there.</p>
<p>My concern is that even with 'no' PHI, the notification can still be considered as such.  To use one of your examples, if a parent/guardian/etc receives a notification of activity from Planned Parenthood and they didn't go, it's easy to put together it is their now not-minor child that went.</p>
<p>My expectation would be that if a person can't access the resource in question, they shouldn't receive a notification.  I would prefer not to go any deeper than that (beyond the minimum qualifications for that statement, like 'a server can specify how long before this takes effect', etc.).</p>
<p>Does that make sense?  Or too far?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span>, I would make the argument that both should be applied.</p>
<p>A user should not be able to successfully create a subscription for resources they don't have access to.  A user should also not receive notifications for resources they no longer have access to.</p>
<p>I do not think it is realistic at scale to do the full verification on every access .  If access is checked every hour/day/etc. and revoked, that would meet my expectations (as long as the user is notified - this may take a few hours to propagate).</p>

<p>So the question here is: do EHR vendors have some reasonably efficient way to provide some close approximation to making revocations work on subscriptions. So far I'd summarize discussion as:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's complicated, with a lot of edge cases</li>
<li>It's hard to enforce revocations <em>immediately</em> but there could be an opportunity to enforce them over a timescale of minutes to hours</li>
<li>It's okay for servers to behave "conservatively" by invalidating subscriptions in some cases where it's not strictly necessary, as long as clients can detect/correct</li>
<li>At the level of the standard or even an Argonaut IG, we don't want to describe all the edge cases; we'd describe general expectations and leave it up to server discretion to nail down the behaviors</li>
</ol>

<p>I think what Jenni is pointing out is that there might need to be many models. Where the notification is just a poke, the notification is identified as a risk, a risk only of pattern.   Where the notification is the content of the notificaiton then there MUST certainly be access control check pror to sending it.</p>

<p>Seems we are getting upside-down. The requester OAuth token is authorizing the requester to have access to the data. The subscription manager checks that authorization applies to the requested subscription. If that same token is used to push the updated PHI to the notification endpoint provided by the requester; then one could present this as authorized. This because the subscription manager is simply enforcing the decision it was given. <br>
My worry with this kind of token reuse is that the subscription notification endpoint can't validate that the data are from an authentic data holder, as that endpoint is never given identity of the sending side of that notification transaction. Thus it can't differentiate these notifications from unauthentic notifications.<br>
This is why I am not a fan of using the requester OAuth token on the notification pathway (that is when the notification is carrying PHI and not just a poke)</p>

<p>I understand that since this is based on an extension of standard OAuth, it may not be a solution we're looking for, but in a similar (non-healthcare) project involving webhook-based subscriptions, we tweaked the authorization service (at the endpoint equivalent to OAuth Introspection) to return (among other things) the expiry date of the client's refresh token and then ensured that the webhook subscription is set to be valid no later than the expiry date of the client's refresh token. For example, if a client provided an access token which was valid for 10 minutes, and the authorization server records also noted that that the client is in possession of a refresh token valid until the end of the month, the latter date was used as the expiry date of the subscription.</p>
<p>I think if we think of a subscription as a form of pre-authorization for access instances scheduled for future, the main access control requirement here is to make sure the client is not able to schedule any access beyond the date-time at which its current authorization expires. I think the refresh token's expiry is a reasonable and practical upper bound for a client's authorization. The client can <em>renew</em> the subscription by an <code>UPDATE</code> or <code>PATCH</code> and by providing a new access token backed by a newer refresh token.</p>

<p>To be clear: I am <em>not</em> stating that the OAuth token originally used is sent anywhere to the original caller. I think what is being discussed here is that the token/user/app in use (and all privs) when the subscription is created governs the data that can be sent/notified for that subscription</p>

<p>Certificate management requires quite a bit of infrastructure.

<p>John, I don't think that's always true (that the manager will have a TLS certificate).  If the server responsible for sending notifications is not the same as the server receiving external calls, there would be no reason to have one there.</p>
<p>It's also common to have a proxy handle the TLS and forward unencrypted requests within an internal network - in which case none of the servers have a cert installed.</p>

<p>I don't see anything that involves a third-party or subsequent outgoing requests.</p>
<p>The 'hammer approach(1)' I can see (right now) using OAuth would be to have the user authenticate with the Subscription server as the client, which would then give the server a token and refresh token that it could maintain/use.

<p>In the current spec, it just has a place for an Auth Header.</p>

I'm trying to understand why the subscription server needs an oauth token for the call back to the client. Usually for webhooks, the concern is authenticity, i.e. whether the call back is indeed coming from the subscription server which can be addressed with simpler solutions (e.g. a common approach I have seen is an hmac signatures using a shared secret provided by the client and recorded with the subscription context).</p>

<p>Hi Mohammad, I think this has turned into a general 'security on subscriptions' thread, unfortunately.</p>
<p>If I am sorting through everything correctly, I see two main topics:<br>
- How does a server know if it should send a notification (authorization window of subscription)?<br>
- How does an Endpoint know that it should accept a notification (authorization of server to send notification)?</p>
<p>I am trying to synthesize what the opinions are around the two into proposals (as far as what needs to go into the resource specs, what needs to go in the security docs, what needs to go into the Argonaut IG, and what needs to be noted as not listed and why (e.g., we feel the bar is too high for mutual TLS to be adopted - so considered and excluded).</p>

<p>Do we think the requirements on auth change are based on the subscription type (ping, id-only, full content)? I'm hoping yes and want to make sure we don't end up mandating the receiving server needs to dance the OAuth dance in order to receive pings. :)</p>

<p>I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191339">@Pascal Pfiffner</span> . This full bi-directional OAuth use would only be needed when the notification carries PHI. So the client requesting the subscription is in-charge of which type of subscription they are asking for. Thus if that client asks for full content, then it must also recognize that the endpoint it provides must support the OAuth responsibilities.</p>

<p>we all should remember that the client can always cancel the Subscription by updating the Subscripiton. So the OAuth checks are necessary but not the typical way to cancel a subscription. The OAuth is primarly going to catch the cases Jenni pointed out much earler in the stream, when the user or app has a security revocation. If the user / app want the subscription to be cancled they would update Subscription</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191339">@Pascal Pfiffner</span> as of right now, I believe that's an implementation detail.  Servers are on the hook for what they do, so they will impose those types of restrictions (e.g., some servers may not allow <code>full-resource</code> at all).</p>
<p>With these discussions, I am trying to make sure the mechanisms in place are reasonably secure and that there is guidance on what should be looked at so implementers aren't broadcasting PHI by using it 'out of the box'.</p>
<p>I would prefer more security, but am realistic enough to know it's too high a barrier for adoption (e.g., end-to-end encryption, key exchanges, etc.).</p>
<p>I <em>am</em> hopeful that some additional channel types eventually 'win' and can be moved into the standard with those types of security, but this likely needs to be in production for a while before that can be properly discussed.</p>
