<p>I've seen discussion on building reliable delivery mechanisms from the client side by using eventsSinceSubscriptionStart and so on.  Has anyone seen an open source implementation of this?  I think I need such a mechanism.  No sense in reimplementing the wheel.</p>

<p>Hi Dan, I've been working on a library for this the past few weeks. I'm adding a widget to the reference client UI to POC what a client state-machine would look like, and after that I'm planning to publish an npm package for it. If that's not your stack, I'm also considering rewriting the algorithm in dotnet.</p>

<p>Right on.  I'm working in Java, but regardless, I'd like to see the state machine part and discuss it.  See you tomorrow / Wednesday, I assume.</p>

<p>I have it on my list to work through this as well - it sounds like a good topic for a breakout session during the connectathon.  We can leave it ad hoc, or schedule something, preferably during a build/test/etc. time.  If you have a preference, just let me know.  Thanks!</p>

<p>Scheduling something would be great, if feasible.  I'm flexible time-wise - let me know any time to meet.  I'm trying to figure out how to recover from missed events by using the $events operation, and it's not as straightforward as I had (naively) hoped.</p>

<p>FYI - My edits to the reference implementation are <a href="https://github.com/madaster97/argonaut-subscription-client-ui/tree/comm-status-card">here</a>. It's just a new panel in the playground.</p>
