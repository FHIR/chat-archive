<p>I was asked if unsolicited notifications is compatible with <a href="http://mqtt.org/" target="_blank" title="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a>.  This looks more like a sub/pub pattern so I am asking here if R5 sub is compatible with it.</p>

<p>It looks like MQTT is explicitly designed for embedded devices to stream events to a broker or another system. The use-case is a bit different, but I'd imagine that the two specs are already fairly harmonized as general pubsub topic-type specs.</p>

<p>AFAIK, parts of MQTT has also been used for Facebook messaging - so its not necessarily scoped to embedded devices</p>

<p>I guess it depends on what you mean by compatible.</p>
<p>You could define a channel for subscriptions that uses MQTT.  In order to not violate the "principles" of MQTT, it would likely need a different payload (given that normal payloads are FHIR bundles, which are 'large' for that protocol).  If someone implemented this on the server, they would likely map <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> resources into MQTT Topics as well, so the FHIR server could plug into the ecosystem.</p>
<p>That said, it feels like a reach to me; I'm not sure what the use case for integrating with it would be (though I am curious).</p>
