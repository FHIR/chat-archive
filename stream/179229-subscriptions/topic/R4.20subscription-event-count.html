<blockquote>
<p>The subscription-event-count extension indicates the number of unique events that have triggered notification attempts on this Subscription PRIOR to the current notification being sent.</p>
<p>In the case of a handshake, this count will always be zero (0).</p>
<p>In the case of a heartbeat notification, this count will be the same as the last notification and will not be incremented due to the heartbeat notification.</p>
<p>In the case of event notifications, the event count will be incremented by the number of notifications contained within this bundle (often a single notification, though servers may choose to batch notifications within a short time interval).</p>
<p>In the case of an event notification that cannot be delivered (e.g., because a client endpoint is offline), the server MAY retry delivery but does not increment the event count; the count represents unique events, not unique delivery attempts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I'm reading too much into this, but should <code>subscription-event-count</code> be:<br>
- the total number of events, <strong>inclusive </strong> of events in the current bundle (i.e. the running total of all <code>bundle-event-count</code> values, including the current bundle that <code>subscription-event-count</code> is being calculated for)<br>
- the total number of events, <strong>exclusive</strong> of events in the current bundle (i.e. the total of all <code>bundle-event-count</code> values sent before this bundle)</p>
<p>The first line of  the description strongly implies the latter (the exclusive definition), but wouldn't an event notification + heartbeat notification sequence violate the  "In the case of a heartbeat notification, this count will be the same as the last notification" requirement?</p>
