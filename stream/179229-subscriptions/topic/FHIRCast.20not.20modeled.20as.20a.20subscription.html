<blockquote>
<p>at the connectathon, we discussed a simpler approach, where the server just has a pub/sub kind of arrangement where a client can either register a listener end-point or inform the server that the user focus has changed to a different url. And the listeners get informed about the change of url. (probably a triple: user id, client id, focus id). THis is much simpler, and doesn't need any resource.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had the same thoughts during/after connectathon, and it seemed to me that reaching a judgment/consensus on the thought will come through finding that the current model makes some of the core use cases complex.  </p>
<p>It also seemed like there was a lot of concern about not being able to take advantage of FHIR as an organization if it started to push outside FHIR. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191864">@Isaac Vetter</span> brought that up.</p>
