<p>Where are example Subscription Notifications for the other channels?  Web-Socketes ( which I am personally not interested in ), EMail/SMS and Messaging?</p>

<ul>
<li>Websockets use the same notification bundle as REST, so I didn't plan to make another set.  Is there something you expect to see different?</li>
<li>Email uses the same notification bundle for attachments, with arbitrary content for email (edit: the message itself).  I'm not sure what a useful example here would look like, but am open to adding content if you have a suggestion (e.g., emails are a supported format for proper examples, so they'd just be inline text).</li>
<li>SMS was removed as a standard channel, so I have no plans to add content around them right now.</li>
<li>Messaging examples are on the list, but I haven't had a chance to add them.  An older example can be found <a href="https://github.com/argonautproject/subscriptions/blob/master/packaging-examples/idonly-mh-wrapped.json" title="https://github.com/argonautproject/subscriptions/blob/master/packaging-examples/idonly-mh-wrapped.json">here</a> in the meantime (from the discussion in Feb - so a little out of date but correct in structure).</li>
</ul>
