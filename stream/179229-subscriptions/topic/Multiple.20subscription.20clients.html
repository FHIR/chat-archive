<p>I have two client applications subscribing via websockets to the same server on two different machines. The subscription element values are identical for both clients but the subscription id is different (expected). Now I upload some data. On one client I get signaled of the ping and do a GET for the resources. The resources are obtained. On the other client, I get signaled of the ping, but the GET returns an empty list of entries in the bundle. Is this expected behavior?</p>
<p>The code of both clients is the same so I expected to get the same resources in both cases after the ping.</p>
<p>I repeated the upload and this time both clients received the data.</p>

<p>That sounds like an error to me (especially given the inconsistency). What server are you testing this with?</p>

<p>A variant of the HAPI FHIR server ... not too many servers support web sockets and 4.0.0!<br>
I've tried it a couple of times and have not repeated the error. Weird. I'll toss it up as an fluke.</p>
