<p>Are there any performance concerns when having a server which supports lots of subscriptions (and: how to deal with those) ? Is this comparable to the support for search ? (question asked by an attendee of one of our FHIR workshops)</p>

<p>Absolutely! This is a major driver in the subscriptions re-design for R5 -- basically, giving servers a way to narrowly define SubscriptionTopics that they can optimize for. This is key because every resource change or data update can potentially trigger many subscriptions; in general, the <em>best</em> you can do is an amount of work that's linear with the number of notifications required (and naively, you could do a lot worse, by effectively running a bunch of searches every time any data changes).</p>
