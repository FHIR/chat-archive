<p>Argonaut examples have both criteria and FHIRPath, and they're duplication of each other. Issue? Though there is a null issue with previous if it isn't there - in FHIRPath needs to use present.notExists or ...</p>
<p>Gino: Intent was that if both are present, FHIRPath restates query criteria (ie: it's intended to be a restatement/equivalent IFF both are present)<br>
What we actually say: <a href="http://build.fhir.org/subscriptiontopic.html#resource-value-tests">http://build.fhir.org/subscriptiontopic.html#resource-value-tests</a> "If a topic requires more granularity than operations provide, a topic can provide either FHIRPath or query (Search) definitions to test against state changes."</p>
<p>Grahame: should we state they are equivalent? Wants both (FHIRPath for things that query can't do)<br>
Problematic for servers that don't do FHIRPath to have things in both areas.</p>
<p>What can't you do with the criteria that you can't do with FHIRPath: query optimization issue. Some things are easier in query that are harder to do in FHIRPath</p>

<p>quick if you can do them in query (or at least, easier to optimise) but FHIRPath is much more expressive</p>
