<p>We have created a subscription service, but find it somewhat difficult to determine which parts are required (or shall-demands) and which parts we can omit for the time being. Is it a requirement to include support for subscription.end and subscription.error?</p>

<p>Since it is not mandatory, <code>Subscription.end</code> could either be supported or not.  That said, it is good practice for your service to indicate that and respond appropriately.  One option, documented in <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#create">http#create</a>) is to return an HTTP <code>422</code> with an <code>OperationOutcome</code> describing that <code>end</code> is not supported, in case clients are leaning on that functionality for something.  There are likely other ways to go about this.</p>
<p>Since <code>Subscription.error</code> is server populated, there should not be anything you need to do there.  I will also note that the element has been removed in R5 (in favor of using the <code>SubscriptionStatus</code> resource).</p>
