<p>hi All - on this weeks call, a few of us discussed what issues are at play for FGB. Most of the noise - that is unhappy - that I am hearing is around life cycles, versions, rate of change... </p>

<p>we agreed to work on this at a governance level over the next little while - to lay down our goals and precepts for this subject</p>

<p>this is a prompt for anyone who wants to share some initial thoughts on this matter (and also a prompt for me not to forget about it)</p>

<p>Life Cycle Governance<br>
The life cycle strategy is a combination of <br>
•   the rules that describe what changes may be made between versions of FHIR, for what level of maturity of artefact<br>
•   the technical facilities provided for implementers to communicate about the version they are using<br>
•   The facilities provided in the specification itself for converting content between versions<br>
Together these enable and/or constrain the ways implementers can deal with ongoing changes in the FHIR standard.<br>
Governing Principles:<br>
•   There will be a clearly documented versioning strategy <br>
•   Changes to it will be discussed transparently and with multiple opportunities for comment from FHIR implementers<br>
•   Known risks around the versioning strategy will be documented<br>
•   The versioning strategy will provide confidence to FHIR implementers about what steps to take to protect their investment going forward<br>
•   The specification will clearly document for the community what processes are in place to test the versioning strategy, and to gather feedback about in in a transparent manner<br>
•   The specification should recommend one or more best-practices for handling inter-version change<br>
•   The FMG is responsible for ensuring that these principles are executed in the specification</p>
