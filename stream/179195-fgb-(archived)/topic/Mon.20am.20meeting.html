<p>We have our breakfast meeting scheduled for 8am.  However, unlike most hotels, we can't grab our food and carry it to the meeting.  So that means either eating before hand or eating after and missing part of the plenary.  (For our lunch meeting, there will be a "light" lunch in the room - not sure exactly what that means, but we'll find out I guess :))</p>
