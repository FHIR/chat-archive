<p>Did you have a great time this weekend busily entering Jira tickets for the Jan ballot but then started to wonder if you remembered to vote on ALL of them?<br>
Are you concerned that some of the 170+ Jira tickets entered between 12/1/2021 and today not associated with a ballot (and thus <strong>won't count as a ballot comment</strong>) MIGHT BE YOURS?<br>
Do you dread the idea of having to look through all of the tickets you entered  to make sure they have all be voted on?</p>
<p>Fear not. There is a filter for you. <br>
With this filter, you can quickly see the tickets you entered since 12/1/2021, that are not associated with a ballot vote.<br>
