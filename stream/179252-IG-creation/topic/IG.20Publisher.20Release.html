<p>I'm just doing a new IG publisher release. I think that the next one, I'll be calling it v1.0.0. There's no particular reason, but the initial list of things I wanted to do are done (templates, technical corrections), and the IG publisher is in routine use. There's 2 major features coming around multi-language support, but they are definitely 2.0 features.</p>

<p>I'll be adding some stuff, likely next week, about cascading IG templates.  But fine with that being part of a 2.x release rather than a 1.x release</p>
