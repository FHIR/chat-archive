<p>There's a new message that spits out a warning about there being bindings on polymorphic elements.  I'm generally in favor of this, but there are a few problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>It complains even when the bindings are example bindings defined on the root resource - which is a place where slicing isn't possible.  Can we get it to only yell about bindings declared in the differential, not the snapshot?</li>
<li>It complains even when only one of the types in the choice is subject to being bound.  It'd be nice if it didn't do that - though we probably need to add some language that clarifies what elements are subject to bindings and what aren't.  (And we should automatically strip bindings from elements that have been constrained to only include types that can't be bound.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I can skip the check in snapshot. There's some screwy corner cases where that would miss the hint, but it should generally be in the ancestor anyway</p>

<p>I've pared the hint to only check for bindable types, and only report the bindable types</p>
