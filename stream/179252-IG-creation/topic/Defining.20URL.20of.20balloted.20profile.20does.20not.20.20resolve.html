<p>We have a ticket on a ballot (<a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-34608">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-34608</a>) that takes issue that a defining URL does not resolve. This is a URL for a new profile that has only existed within in the published balloted version and does not live on the IG canonical URL (until we officially publish it). </p>
<ol>
<li>How should we resolve the issue? (Any official language to use)</li>
<li>This also shows up as a problem in the generated CapabilityStatement links. Any guidance on what those links should point to? Published artifacts are not generally aware of the base URL they are published to and a relative URL won't be usable outside of the context of the full IG.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Find it "not persuasive" and indicate that the link will not resolve until the specification is officially published.</li>
<li>Those will get redirects on official publication as well</li>
</ol>
