<p>Why are you trying to include xhtml into a markdown file?  Also, where is your included file located?</p>

<p>I'm not sure you can  do an include of xhtml .   try html files instead  and all included files needs to be in the _includes folder.  The <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/" target="_blank" title="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/">Jekyll documentation</a>  explains this pretty well.</p>

<p>Whoa slow down partner... you are coming across very demanding.   Try starting your posts a little softer and read the Jekyll and IG documentation.   An examples page is built like any other.    update the menu bar,  creat a new html page in the pages directory add the examples content to it and you are off and running...</p>

<p>Given that the issue being reported is "file not found", I'd suggest posting a zip of your full input folder.  That might give us a better idea of what's going on.</p>

<p>I have already privately advised <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194777">@abhishek gupta</span> that this is problematic and that at some point, a commercial relationship will be needed with someone for questions of this nature. You're all welcome to continue responding, but you don't need to</p>

<p>I took a quick scan and I have no idea what you're doing.  You've got a whole mix of HTML and Markdown - and a huge number of files.  In general, it's best to build an implementation guide up.  Start with just a few files and make sure that builds well, then build up to something more complex.  I've never actually used markdown with the IGPublisher, so I'm not well positioned to diagnose.   As Grahame has mentioned, this forum isn't really intended for this level of support.  If you're getting an error message that's incoherent or the build is throwing a null pointer error, then that's absolutely our responsibility to fix.  But if the particular organization of your files happens to be wrong, that's on you to fix - or to hire someone to assist you.  If you're not in a position to hire someone, start with one of the existing implementation guides , trim it down to the bare minimum and get that to run, then replace with your own bare minimum content and get that to run, then slowly increase the content and complexity, building regularly.  That will make it much easier to figure out what's going on.</p>
