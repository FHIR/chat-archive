<p>I got this error once before and for some reason it went away. I think I was getting it from doing the continuous versus the one-time build. But now its back. I am getting 24 errors and they are all due to the generated 'text' entry in each of my example resources. Something about a bad link. Why is the validator even looking at this entry? My example resources do not have one.</p>

<p>why is it broken?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192228">@Brian Reinhold</span>, do you mean the broken links in the QA report of your <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/phd/">CI build</a>? I got similar errors when rebuilding the PoCD IG a few weeks ago (which haven't been reported in the September ballot version). The errors are about links from the profile's differential view to detailed descriptions for slices on data type choices. I got them fixed by replacing the specific type (e.g., valueQuantity) by generic type (e.g., value[x]) in the element.path expression.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192966">@Stefan Karl</span> I checked the errors and they were only on one value[x] case and that was in the Observation.component. I have similar value[x] slices all over the place and they do not create the errors. However, when I do as you say on JUST the accuracy component in the Numeric, those errors do, indeed, go away. There are two more components that have such errors. The accuracy in the compound and the threshold and alert-op  text strings in the Numeric.</p>
<p>Why not all the other sliced value[x]s where I DON'T have a value[x] in the path?<br>
This</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>    &lt;element id=&quot;Observation.value[x]:valueQuantity.system&quot;&gt;
      &lt;path value=&quot;Observation.valueQuantity.system&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;min value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;fixedUri value=&quot;http://unitsofmeasure.org&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/element&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>causes no error.</p>

<p>I don't know. I got the errors in all slices and fixed them as described above.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192966">@Stefan Karl</span>  I went ahead and did it for all of the cases too, and all the errors did go away. I did not check which ones I could 'get away' with. Not sure I understand this. But I do recall (a couple of years ago) going around and entering all the value-specific text strings in the path in order to get it to work. It was so long ago I don't recall the reason.</p>
