<p>I have an Observation profile where I need to constrain the set of allowed coded values (valueCodeableConcept) based on the code. One set of <a href="http://Observation.codes">Observation.codes</a> would have one set of possible values and another set of codes would have a different set of possible values. <br>
I can think of a couple of possible ways to address this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different profiles</li>
<li>Invariants</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the fact that a set of <a href="http://Observation.codes">Observation.codes</a> have the same set of types of values, there is not really anything about them that would logically group them, which is why I don't like the profile option (Not to mention a possible undesirable increase in the number of profiles). Any other better ways to handle this than variants that provide rules on a bunch of codes?</p>

<p>We've talked about incorporating ObservationDefinition into validator capabilities.  However, that's probably a lot heavier than just using invariants.  The invariants would be pretty simple if you have valuesets for both the .code and the .valueCodeableConcept.</p>

<p>I don't know.  It seems that ObservationDefinition would likely be more visible and easily accessible and understandable.</p>
