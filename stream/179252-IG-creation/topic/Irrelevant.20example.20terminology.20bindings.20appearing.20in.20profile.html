<p>In the CARIN BB ExplanationOfBenefit profiles, there are multiple slices of supportingInfo. In the base FHIR R4 standard supportingInfo.reason has an example binding to MissingTooth Reason Codes. The currently published CARIN BB IG does not currently address oral/dental at all, so this is causing some confusion.</p>
<p>Is there a way to suppress these sort of bindings when they do not apply and we are not specifically providing an alternate binding?</p>
<p>For example, in the Pharmacy profile: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/StructureDefinition-C4BB-ExplanationOfBenefit-Pharmacy.html#terminology-bindings">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/StructureDefinition-C4BB-ExplanationOfBenefit-Pharmacy.html#terminology-bindings</a></p>

<p>I have a change request to only show the relevant bindings for differential and must support views which I think would remove most of this confusion.  You can override an example binding with another valuesets but cannot make unbound.</p>

<p>We are getting the same issue and also received a ballot comment about it. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> you don't have the change request number handy do you so I can reference it in the ballot issue? I looked here but can't find anything: <a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/issues?q=is%3Aissue+example+is%3Aopen">https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/issues?q=is%3Aissue+example+is%3Aopen</a></p>
