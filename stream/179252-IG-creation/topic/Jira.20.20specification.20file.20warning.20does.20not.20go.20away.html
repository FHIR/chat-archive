<p>I updated the Jira  specification file "FHIR-pocd.xml" in <a href="https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts">https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts</a> with content from the IG publisher output and some changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Modified names to distinguish between CodeSystem and ValueSet</li>
<li>Added two "deprecated" entries for version and Observation resource, which have been present in the previous version</li>
</ol>
<p>Without these changes .buildlocal.bat failed.<br>
After pull request and successful merge, rebuilding the IG still generates the warning "The jira specification file appears to be out of date …" in <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/uv-pocd/qa.html">QA.html</a>.<br>
Comparing jira-current.xml and jira-new.xml shows the following differences:</p>

<p>How can I get rid of the warning?</p>

<p>It looks like you have keys that changed  - you've got ValueSet keys on CodeSystem resources.  Did you used to have value sets and got rid of them?  If so, you'll need to deprecate those artifacts</p>

<p>I was also wondering about that. Nothing changed in the IG. With the default FHIR-pocd.xml in JIRA-Spec-Artifacts (having only deprecated artifact entries for base resources) the publisher created entries that are now in jira-current.xml. I changed the name by appending "(CodeSystem)" or "(ValueSet)" for the four pairs with equal names. After the update on JIRA-Spec-Artifacts the IG publisher seems to mix up CodeSystem and ValueSet entries in jira-new.xml.<br>
The build log has warnings "Jira file generation will not be correct because multiple artifacts have the same name (ignoring content in '()')". What does that mean? In the IG, identical names for CodeSystem and ValueSet are not an issue because they are clearly separated. In Jira they need to be distinguished, therefore I changed the names.</p>

<p>Actually, even within the IG, you should have distinct names for code systems and value sets because in the table of contents, there won't be anything else that distinguishes them.</p>

<p>I can change names after ballot. But the warning "The jira specification file appears to be out of date with the versions, artifacts and pages currently defined in the IG. ..." is still wrong, because the Jira specification isn't out of date. Can we consider it a tooling issue?</p>

<p>Why can't you change the titles now?  That's something that <em>should</em> happen before the ballot opens.  It's definitely not a tooling issue as having unique names across all artifacts is definitely an intended behavior.</p>

<p>it sounds like you are taking the created Jira spec file and then manually modifying it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I updated the Jira specification file "FHIR-pocd.xml" in <a href="https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts">https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts</a> with content from the IG publisher output and some changes:</p>
<p>Modified names to distinguish between CodeSystem and ValueSet<br>
Added two "deprecated" entries for version and Observation resource, which have been present in the previous version</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you didn't actually change the guide content, then that is why the warning is there.</p>
