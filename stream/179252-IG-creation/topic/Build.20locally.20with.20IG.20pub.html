<p>Is there a way to constrain the IG Publisher to build locally? I note that it keeps going to the build server. One may not always be able to be on line. I thought by creating a "packages": "packages" entry in the ig.json that the publisher would grab the tgz file in the "packages" directory but it does not. <br>
On the other hand it could be that the package has not been updated (though I have downloaded the latest) and the publisher goes to the build server because of that. (The publisher is reporting a version 1 but it needs version 2.)</p>
<p>Updating hl7.fhir.core-3.6.0 package from source (too old - is 1, must be 2</p>

<p>I'll have a look at it tomorrow - that change was thrown together in a hurry because of git</p>

<p>If I create a 'packages' directory and place the tgz file in that directory and then add<br>
"packages":"packages" to the ig.json, will the publisher skip downloading the tgz file? That takes 40 to 50 seconds.</p>

<p>Okay, I will remove it. I guess what happens is that the package gets downloaded and is only downloaded again if the previous one is out of date. Its just that it keeps downloading a package which is version 1 but the publisher wants version 2. So its re-downloaded every time.</p>
