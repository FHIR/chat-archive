<p>If you are using the same set of resources, but using them in a different order, with a different workflow, do you need/want a separate IG for each workflow?    Or is it better to  simply depict the different workflows in a separate tab on the IG?</p>

<p>One option is an IG that defines the resources and others that define different workflows.  A second option is a combined IG with different sections.  Which is appropriate depends a bit on how you want to publish and also how implementers will consume.  With one IG, you're always publishing the whole specification.  While you can limit balloting to specific subsets, when you publish, everything is subject to QA, etc.  If implementers may need to look at multiple workflows, then having everything all together is easier than having to jump around between IGs.  There's also the possibility of inconsistency if different 'workflow' IGs point to different versions of the 'resource' IG.</p>

<p>Thank you for your thoughts.  These are all important considerations when making this decision.</p>
