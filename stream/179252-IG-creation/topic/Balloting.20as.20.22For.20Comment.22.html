<p>Not sure what stream this set of questions should appear in.<br>
I have a FHIR IG in the works that might not be ready for a first time STU ballot in the September cycle. Generally speaking, is it of value to have a For Comment in preparation for a first round STU?<br>
Can someone point me to the requirements for a FHIR For Comment ballot? Does the PSS have to be updated if such a ballot was not explicitly planned for?</p>

<p>I ignore anything marked for comment and I assume others do as well.</p>

<p>The FMG will only allow you to ballot as "for comment" if you have specific questions for the ballot community that you need resolved before you can progress to a 'real' ballot and there's no other mechanism for you to get the needed answers other than going to ballot.  For comment ballots are not allowed as "practice runs" because that places an unnecessary burden on our ballot community.  Content shouldn't ever go to ballot unless the sponsoring WG considers the material fully implementable and ready to publish as an STU at the time of the ballot.</p>
<p>There's no need to update the PSS.  You'll need to do an NIB (and you'll have to have an approved IG proposal).  When the FMG reviews the NIB, you'll have to convince them that the "for comment" ballot is necessary.</p>
