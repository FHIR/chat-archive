<p>I looked into fixing the harsh page transitions ( they bounce on my screen)  There are javascript solutions out there.  Before I start noodling with this does anyone have any experience with fixing this and would like to submit a PR?</p>

<p>I added a pr to soften the pages transitions in the base templates - tried to pick a transition speed that is a compromise between all the browsers.  Safari is still too fast  so  you see a noticable  bounce,  but lengthening it makes the other too slow.   feedback is welcome.</p>
