<p>We (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197608">@David deRoode</span>) are wondering what current best practice is around using  the data-absent-reason extension vs specifying "nullFlavor" type values in a value set? Are there cases where one would be better than another or is one way always preferred?</p>

<p>Bottom line is to use codes instead of DAR for coded elements:</p>
<p>see <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html#missing-data">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html#missing-data</a></p>
<p>We got our hands slapped for originally trying to DAR coded elements, because you can't use an extension for extensible and required bindings for min=1 coded elements - the bindings prohibit a DAR work-around.  Besides it makes  more sense to express the DAR concept as a code in element itself.    You are screwed if you have a min=1 <br>
 and required binding and no code available.   ( Had trackers to make this guidance more explicit and obvious, but I don't think it has been applied yet - need to follow up on that)</p>

<p>Yikes - thinking I might have done that in a few places... Better go and check.</p>

<p>What about creating value sets that include the null-flavour codesystem?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191549">@Frank Oemig</span> That's what's recommended.  Though we generally encourage people to draw on the DAR code system rather than the null flavor code system.</p>
