<p>Hello, </p>
<p>I have a question about the FHIR Structure of ServiceRequest Obect (I hope I'm on the right stream)<br>
The requester can actually be <br>
Practitioner | PractitionerRole | Organization | Patient | RelatedPerson | Device</p>
<p>My question is Since RelatedPerson is possible, why is not Person possible ?<br>
I mean what about the Assistant of a Doctor ?<br>
We could have as requester the Practitioner or PractitionerRole, and also a Person this person will<br>
include the name of the Dr Assistant that filled the request ?</p>
<p>I first thought about using related Person, but in Related Person you have to add a link to the patient (It is Mandatory)</p>
<p>The same remark is valid for <a href="http://Composition.author">Composition.author</a></p>
<p>Any Idea ?<br>
Best regards,<br>
David</p>

<p>This stream is more about designing IGs.  This question is about the base standard so <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179166" href="/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers">#implementers</a> might be a better location.  However, I'll provide an answer here.  Person is <em>never</em> allowed to be referenced as an actor in FHIR.  It's sole purpose is to allow linking identities and maintaining shared demographics for multiple Patient/Practitioner and/or RelatedPerson instances.  Whenever other resources need to point to an individual, they must always point to them as Patient, RelatedPerson or Practitioner.  Assistant of a doctor is a Practitioner.  So is a cab driver or admin clerk.  Practitioner covers anyone who's working in their professional capacity.  RelatedPerson, on the other hand, is someone who is acting in the capacity of their <em>personal</em> relationship with the Patient - relative, friend, neighbor, etc.</p>
