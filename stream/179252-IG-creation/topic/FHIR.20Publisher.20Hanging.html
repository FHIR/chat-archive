<p>I am having some problems getting the fhir publisher to complete.<br>
I just returned from my Covid vacation and had to reload my computer; I reinstalled ruby, jekyll, IG Publisher etc.</p>
<p>I tried to run publisher on a project that worked previously and it hangs on</p>
<p>Jekyll: Generating. </p>
<p>I do get an error that publisher can't find a JIRA file.<br>
 [get] Error opening connection java.io.FileNotFoundException: <a href="https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts/raw/master/xml/FHIR-us-breast-radiology.xml">https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts/raw/master/xml/FHIR-us-breast-radiology.xml</a><br>
Would that cause jekyll to hang? <br>
Any ideas?</p>

<p>That file doesn't exist in that repo.

<p>Thx <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192587">@David Pyke</span> <br>
I had previously (October, 2019) pushed FHIR-us-breast-radiology.xml to JIRA-Spec-Artifacts\xml, but it appears to have gone AWOL. I guess I will have to track down what happened there...</p>
<p>I was also surprised at the error message, as it references a directory in GitHub that doesn't exist (JIRA-Spec-Artifacts/raw/master/xml) - hopefully that is only the error message.</p>

<p>Note that, while addressing the Jira file issue is important, it's unlikely related to the hanging.  Jekyll doesn't use the Jira file at all, so there's something else going on there...</p>

<p>Jekyll is a third-party process.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> has a bit of experience debugging with it.  How long have you left it to run?  What's your memory and processor doing?  It might be you're memory bound and it's just really slow?</p>

<p>You could monitor the output folder and see what files exist and what the last file successfully created is</p>

<p>yes. my immediate take is that Jekyll can't start, and for some reason, the system process that launched it is showing an error you can't see and not terminating. So debugging this is around getting the start conditions for ruby and jekyll all sorted.</p>

<p>at the point it is humg, you can run jekyll yourself from the command line on the temp folder</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>   I let it run for an hour, and in the past it only took 5-10  minutes. <br>
When it gets to the 'Jekyll: Generating ...' system cpu goes to 0, memory at 6694.3 mb (48%). <br>
Windows task monitor shows ruby started as a sub process of the command shell, but no Jekyll. <br>
I don't think it is a memory issue</p>
<p>When I look at the build/output directory, it is empty. There is a folder called .jekyll-cache under temp that is only a couple kb long, so I agree that Jekyll is probably not starting.<br>
I can run jekyll -v and get a valid response so I know that Jekyll is installed.<br>
When go into the temp dir and try running 'jekyll -s pages build" I get<br>
fatal: 'jekyll build' could not be found ...</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> What is the command line to run Jekyll? Is it jekyll -s pages build' or 'jekyll -s pages compose'?</p>
<p>I just reinstalled everything after a clean os reinstall, so I am wondering if there is a problem with the newest versions of ruby/jekyll et all?<br>
These are the versions:<br>
ruby 2.7.2<br>
jekyll 4.2</p>
<p>Many thanks for your time!</p>

<p>When running Jekyll, the working directory is the temp dir, and the command is </p>
<p><code>jekyll build --destination {{output}}</code></p>
<p>where output is the folder the generated content is going into. </p>

<p>I had to use the modified command line:<br>
jekyll build --source pages --destination c:\temp\xxyyz</p>
<p>This gave me the error<br>
jekyll-4.2.0/lib/jekyll/tags/include.rb:219:in `locate_include_file': Could not locate the included file 'menu.xml' in any of ["C:/Development/HL7/BreastRadiologyProfilesV3/Projects/build/temp/pages/_includes"].

<p>This looks like a FSH  integration issue. I upgraded to the latest version of FSH and it changed the output directory structure. I will need to track down what I did wrong.</p>
<p>Is there a reason that publisher can not output an error message like this from Jekyll?</p>
<p>Many thanks for the pointers.</p>

<p>I certainly expect that it would; this is a normal kind of error to be displayed. The publisher part is simple: output anything unexpected to the log, and wait for the process to finish.</p>

<p>I've seen something like this before.  The best I could figure out then is that the Jekyll process never finishes because it's waiting for some include or other file to be generated.  I wish there was a way to figure out what file it's looking for because I'm having the same problem right now.</p>

<p>I too had this Jekyll hanging issue, but did not see any errors in output. The only way to figure out was by debugging through the IG Generator Java project. More info on that in this <a href="#narrow/stream/215610-shorthand/topic/Debugging.20IG.20generation">thread</a></p>
