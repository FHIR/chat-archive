<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  I get this warning in the QA.html relating to the JIRA specification</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>The jira specification file appears to be out of date with the versions, artifacts and pages currently defined in the IG. A proposed revised file to be reviewed and, if appropriate, submitted as a pull request against the XML folder in https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts. To see the differences, perform a file compare on &#39;template/jira-current.xml&#39; (a normalized view of what is in Github) and &#39;template/jira-new.xml&#39; (reflects current IG content)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Anyone know what it means and how to fix it?</p>
<p>For what its worth I see no difference between my jiraspec.xml and the FHIR-phd.xml in JIRA-Spec-Artifacts. What is out of date? one of the version values in both of the files? I edited my local file to use version 1.0 instead of 0.1 and it got restored to the original when running the publisher. Probably pulled from JIRA-Spec-Artifacts...?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  Where do I find these files? I found the JIRA_Spec-Artifacts project but I have no idea where template/jira-current.xml and template/jira-new.xml are located. I could not find them in the Artifacts project. Where are these two 'template' files? I searched some other projects with the name 'template' in them but that turned out to be barking up the wrong tree. Of course there are many pages of projects and I could not search them all.</p>
<p>I found them in my own project...why would my project have both files and not use the new one? What needs to happen here? Do I need to put the new one in JIRA_Spec-Artifacts? If so, I suppose it is something you have to do or something someone with write access to that repo has to do. If so, I attach the file here. <a href="user_uploads/10155/97RJE7q_mch0fgLecREzh7Kc/jira-new.xml">jira-new.xml</a><br>
By the way, the difference is HUGE which scares me. There are many elements in the 'new' version that are not in the old. It seems like it is much MUCH larger than any of the corresponding files in JIRA_Spec-Artifacts. That does not bode well.</p>

<p>The 'new' file is driven by what artifacts and pages exist in your IG.  If you've renamed artifacts or pages, you'll need to adjust the 'new' file to reflect that renaming (keep the key and change the name, possibly also including the old name).  You might choose to not expose certain fine-grained artifacts.  E.g. you might choose not to allow tracking changes against each individual example, but instead have an 'examples' page.  But you do want to ensure that all major artifacts and pages that exist in your IG are represented in Jira and there is continuity between feedback provided in past releases, even as artifacts have been renamed, merged, etc.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  How does the new file get generated? I certainly did not do it. And looking through the list it looks like it does list all the 'artifacts' that are in the IG. Is there a reason NOT to include all of them? And if I renamed an example, for example, wouldn't that get automatically updated next build?</p>

<p>The new file is generated by the build process - driven by what's in your IG.</p>

<p>The reason to not include them is if you feel the fine-grained list would be overwhelming.  For example, with core, we don't list every single example or search parameter because we'd have 10k+ artifacts.  For IGs, that's less of a problem, but could still be too much.  Similarly, some pages get 'grouped' and are treated as a single 'page' from the perspective of tracking feedback.  Your key question is "how, as a work group, do you want feedback against your IG to be categorized?"</p>

<p>So I guess I would have a better understanding of this file if I went through the process of reporting a bug or something like that on this IG. I am not sure how to do that. I see the usual propose a change option, but that brings me to the generic FHIR issues page. I would think it would be easier to find the issue the more 'detail' one has - so one can home into the problem. Of course, I have no idea what I am talking about as I have never submitted an issue against an IG.</p>

<p>From the generic FHIR issues page, fill in the 'specification' to be your IG.  That then determines what artifacts, pages and versions are available in the other dropdowns.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  I actually tried to do that, but I did not find my IG in the list. I did find Personal HealthCare Devices but I do not think that is the IG - it only has a version of 0.1 (probably a default). It might be because this IG has never been published.</p>

<p>If it's gone to ballot it'll be in Jira.  Why do you think "Personal Healthcare Devices" isn't the IG?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> Its version was 0.1 (it was 1.0.0 at ballot) and I could not find any artifacts. All my entries return nothing found.</p>
<p>Wait a second, that's what's in the phd file in the JIRA-artifacts file. There are no artifacts in that file and its also 0.1. That's why I am finding nothing. So I need that updated file to replace the PHD version of the template in the JIRA-Artifacts directory. Then I should find something.</p>

<p>It should not have been 1.0.0 at ballot - that would have been the publication release number, not the ballot release number.<br>
Correct - that file is what determines what's available in the Jira dropdowns for people to provide feedback.  (And that's why the build process now hollers if it appears there's content in your IG that isn't listed in Jira)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  Okay, maybe it wasn't 1.0.0 at ballot. Was probably current. But then I need to have that updated file installed in the artifacts list. I assume that it can always be changed once we have some experience. To be honest with you, I had no idea such an infrastructure existed for IGs.</p>

<p>Once you add an artifact or page, you can't remove it (easily) because someone might have referenced it in Jira, so in general it's best to be cautious about what you add, because once it's in a Jira dropdown, it's there forever.  You can deprecate - which keeps people from selecting it on new issues, but you can't easily get rid of stuff that might have been used on old issues.</p>

<p>When the PR is merged into the main build, there's an automatic process that pushes "built" content into a separate branch.  Jira grabs the list of elements from the XML file exposed on that separate branch</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span>  the data/package-list.yaml is to enable references to the package-list within the ig and is not used for validation.  In the guides I author, I typically set it up to have both ig.yaml and package-list.yaml in the data folder using a bash script to refresh the ig.yaml file.  The package-list is manually updated in real time as I apply trackers to create a change log which is published in the blue information box in the home page. for example see <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core/branches/master/index.html">here</a>:  This helps reviewers qa the applied trackers. Prior to publishing the package-list.yaml is converted to a json file and the blue box removed.</p>

<p>Thanks Eric! Yes, we adopted your styling for the QM IG (because it's fantastic), so we are using that same approach, and I've just then updated the package-list.json manually. (<a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-measures">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-measures</a>)</p>

<p>I think it'd be cleaner to have the template process copy the package-list.json file into the temp/pages/_data folder - no need to have a yaml file (or remember to run custom bash scripts)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  For me editing in Yaml is easier and more intuitive.  converting to and from json is single click on my editing or a single line in my bash.

<p>Right now this is a manual process, but we have discussed before the automation of the change logs , maybe by adding a couple of fields to Jira and doing an export into the ig.  The fields are summary of change and reference to change in the spec.</p>

<p>The problem is if someone comes along and fixes something in your IG, they're going to edit the json file - and may not even realize the yaml exists.  And you'll then wipe their fix the next time you run the bash script.  We're trying to make our IGs so that anyone who knows how to edit IGs can feel comfortable editing any IG.</p>

<p>FSH is an official HL7 standard and is used by many HL7 IG authors (eventually, I expect it'll be used by most).  It also offers a bunch of features that make it significantly faster and easier to create and maintain IGs.  I don't think we can make the same argument here for yaml vs. json for the package-list.json.  If you feel strongly that there's a serious benefit to moving to yaml, then we should have that as a discussion and do it for everyone.</p>
