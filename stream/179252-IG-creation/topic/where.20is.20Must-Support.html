<p>Is there a well known place in an HL7 IG for a reader to find the definition of Must-Support? Should there be? Are there some good candidates?</p>

<p>The issue with MS being a narrative definition (we really should have the option to have a ValueSet) is that when you reuse things across IGs users will lose track.</p>

<p>I’m not convinced a coded representation is the problem. </p>
<p>And actually, the more I think about MS, the more it generally scares me. As I’m understanding it now, I think all MS requirements in any IG you implement (or is a dependency of one you implement) apply to any MS element in any profile you implement. It’s like the FHIR equivalent of the GPL open source license—sounds like a good idea, but it infects everything. I hope I’m misunderstanding. </p>
<p>I also have problems with MS because, unlike all the other profiling controls, I can’t validate an instance against it. We pretend it is computable and flag elements as MS (and coding it would take us further in that direction) but in the end, with anything less than an infinite vocabulary, it comes down to interpreting a narrative that applies to the systems, not to the instances. </p>
<p>/end rant.</p>

<p>MS doesn't affect downstream 'new' artifacts (unless you declare that your mustSupport rules are the same as an ancestor IG's), but they do affect all derived profiles.</p>
<p>MS has <em>nothing</em> to do with the instance.  It has to do with the behavior of the systems that produce and/or consume the instance.  We're not pretending it's computable.  mustSupport=true is just a flag that says "there are rules for what you must be able to do in your system with this element".</p>
<p>We <em>could</em> have an optional IG property that indicates the URL of the location where the default mustSupport rules for the IG are set and set the MS flag to link to that.  The tricky bit is that if those are overridden by a particular profile, then you'd want to jump to the text in the profile instead.</p>

<p>I was not looking to solve the problem, just make an incremental improvement. Conformance Expectations is not great, but an attempt to try to get IGs to use a consistent narrative is an incremental improvement. -- which leads me to, increment beyond this would be an element in the IG that is markdown and expresses what must-support means in that IG. IG build magic to have that rendered in the human narrative where the IG author wants it rendered.</p>

<p>I see no hope of MS being computable. If anyone was using it for a computable purpose, then we would have a strict functionality like cardinality, or binding, etc.  The use of MS is explicitly not computable rule, but one which the IG could impose..</p>

<p>I am a fan of us coming up with something more than binary. I would like a vocabulary, I think we know some MS patterns that we could snap into a vocabulary. Like "R2/RE", or "shall be implemented"... We now have some experience, we should be able to come up with some vocabulary, with IG defined codes for things not in that extensible vocabulary.</p>

<p>my "where is Must-Support" is not trying to make it computable, but trying to make it definitively findable definition. I think there is some interest in having more than a binary, thus flavors of MS. Even these flavors don't appear to be trying to make them computable (yet). Just findable definitions for each flavor. an IG defined url seems like a reasonable firs step off of binary.</p>

<p>My apologies, but my proposal addresses exactly that. It would come as an extension with IG-specific codes. So it is to the IG author to collect the requirements and to sort them a little bit. As a first step not too difficult.</p>

<p>"mustimplement" isn't meaningful, it's just a synonym for mustSupport - if we're going to have codes, they'd need to define <em>what</em> needs to be implemented (storage, display, capture, etc.).  RE doesn't make sense in FHIR because it's combining mustSupport and cardinality.  mustSupport codes (if we have them) can't speak to cardinality at all, only to behavior within the sender or receiver.</p>

<p>"Required but may be empty" is absolutely talking about cardinality.  (As all of the v2 conformance codes do, to one extent or other).  If we're going to introduce codes, they ought to have specific meaning that makes clear what needs to be implemented.  The notion of flagging something as "implementer-relevant" would be distinct from mustSupport because it will appear on elements where mustSupport is not set.</p>

<p>I use MS for all of the attributes in a resource that we are expecting to exchange.  For 1..x fields, that is somewhat obvious since we've said that it always has to be there.  For 0..x fields, it is totally akin to RE since the field is marked as optional, thus the 0 min cardinality, but it is required to send if you have or you should expect to receive it if the server has it.</p>

<p>Here is an interesting conundrum because that's how you are defining it, but I'm defining MS in my guides as what you can expect to specifically receive with the profiles defined in my guides.  For instance, I might define Organization.identifier, name, address, and telecom as MS because those are the elements that want to receive and that I will be sending back when queried.  A client can obviously send the other things in the resource, but my profile says that only those four elements are important to the use cases in my guide.</p>

<p>But you're not marking everything else 0..0 (which is good), and that means that, in theory, they could receive anything.  What you're specifically saying is "this is the information the sender must be able to expose" and, maybe "this is the information the receiver must be able to consume".  (It's possible to define mustSupport in a US Core-like way where the receiver is free to do what they like.)</p>

<p>For me it is interesting to see, that you guys are always use good examples what MS means (in a certain IG). All those statements comprise the same elements/aspects. I wonder that we should not be able to extract those. One is action. Store, print and display are always brought forward. Direction is another, ie. sender/receiver. So, why not adding action=print + direction=receiver (as a MS extension) to a specific element to say, that exactly this element/attribute must be printed by the receiver. I know that one can do that by a specific profile for the receiver to denote print elements, but this is overkill from a management perspective. For computation, one can use this management information to generate appropriate technical profiles.</p>

<p>note that this is how IHE treats Document Content, and has named options for each of these that a Document Consumer would declare (display, persist, decompose, etc). As in a Document Content profile there is little declared infrastructure, the interop layer would tend to be one of the Document Sharing profiles (XDS, XDR, XCA, XDM, MHD, etc). And a Document Content profile can be used in a larger IG where workflows can be triggered and specific processing defined.  Some workflows or processing requirements may call upon one of the named options from the Document Content IG. This is highly modular approach. The specific mechanism is the ability to have sub-behaviors that can be explicitly named (named options) and invoked by higher level need (systems design or another IG).  - <a href="https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/PCC/IHE_PCC_TF_Vol1.pdf">https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/PCC/IHE_PCC_TF_Vol1.pdf</a></p>

<p>I'm ambivant on this. I think that the most useful aspect of being more specific about must-support is allowing the IG publisher to make a reference to a section in an IG somewhere that explains what must support means for this particular element. I think that if US IG had a way to do different must-support for different elements, things might be a little simpler, because must-support means different things for different elements So I'll certainly support doing something in the IG publisher if we can get enough consensus to come up with some kind of extension.</p>
<p>I'm less confident that we'll come up with something that has real semantic meaning.  Consider the definition of RE from v2.7:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The element may be missing from the message, but should be sent by the sending application if there is relevant data. A conforming sending application should be capable of populating all "RE" elements. A conforming sending application that knows the required values for the element, should send that element. A conforming sending application that does not know the required values, shall omit the element. </p>
<p>Receiving applications will be expected to process (save/print/archive/etc.) or ignore data contained in the element, but should be able to successfully process the message if the element is omitted (no error message should be generated because the element is missing). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>this is all should (not SHOULD!). And all so qualified. "if there is <em>relevant</em> data? By whose decision? And what is the impact of security and privacy?</p>
<p>And receiving applications will be expected to do something, or not? What else could they do than something, or not?</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, this definition is as meaningless as anything we've come up with, and I've never understood why anyone would bother with it (long before I started on FHIR)</p>

<p>one other note: it's clear that Lloyd has a very stylised way of using must-support that is totally coherent and self-contained (and maybe even to be recommended) but is based on some assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the specification, and I'm pretty sure that not all of us would agree to them</p>

<p>If you're going to define codes, I'd encourage starting with a set of 5-6 diverse IGs and see how they've defined mustSupport for their IGs and how you might code that - and then think about what benefits you'd get from representing that information in a coded way.</p>

<p>Regarding security, this is something one should leave out from any discussion, because we are talking about capabilities.</p>

<p>it should be mentioned, so that there's clarity: if a system declines to populate a field because of security concerns, does it meet the RE requirement?</p>

<p>I would separate that. In a testing environment there shouldn't be security concerns to properly validate. In real life if you want to validate covering security aspects one has to create appropriate profiles.</p>

<p>of course you want to test security. All I'm saying is, we should be clear about our expectations</p>

<p>That is not what I have said. Of course you have to test security to see it is working. But you cannot expect to validate against a profile requiring a name and immediately test with security on saying not to send names. <br>
If you want to do that you have to work with different profiles...</p>

<p>mustSupport isn't "requiring" anything in terms of the instance.  It'll be common for mustSupport to make allowance for business agreements, patient consent, regulation and other restrictions on populating the element.</p>
