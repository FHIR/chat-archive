<p>THe IG Publisher is giving me a new error that I have not seen before</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Resource has provided narrative, but the narrative indicates that it is generated - remove the narrative or fix it up
</code></pre></div>
<p>None of my resource examples have a narrative. How do I stop the publisher from generating the narratives in its html versions of the examples?</p>
<p>I should also add that there is one example I have which the IG Publisher generates a narrative for but it is NOT reported as an error.</p>
<p>This may be a result of the fact I was running the wrong batch file.</p>
<p>How long does it take for a push to the git repo to show up on the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/">build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/</a>?</p>
