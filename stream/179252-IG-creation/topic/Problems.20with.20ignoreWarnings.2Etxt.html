<p>I am trying to figure out exactly what to copy into the ignoreWarnings.txt file. All I have been able to gather is that the text to ignore has to be an exact copy. But it is not clear from the documentation exactly what part to copy. For example, in the qa.txt file I have this error I would like to suppress:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/PhdBaseObservation: StructureDefinition: Validate resource against profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/StructureDefinition
ERROR: StructureDefinition/PhdBaseObservation: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[86].fixed.ofType(uri): URL value &#39;http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/pocd/CodeSystem/measurement-status&#39; does not resolve
ERROR: StructureDefinition/PhdBaseObservation: StructureDefinition.differential.element[28].fixed.ofType(uri): URL value &#39;http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/pocd/CodeSystem/measurement-status&#39; does not resolve
</code></pre></div>
<p>I want to suppress the measurement-status does not resolve error. Exactly WHAT should I copy from the qa.txt file to suppress that error?</p>
<p>THanks!</p>

<p>You need to include the entire line in qa.txt for the particular error.  That should work.</p>

That includes the 'ERROR:' correct?  Do I need to include the second line as well even though it is the same value set that is causing the error?</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by the "second line".  I'm pretty sure that each error is on its own single line (but they can be pretty long).  If you don't think that's true in your case, then maybe you can post an example.</p>

<p>Sorry, I wasn't clear. I mean that if I want to suppress both of the errors, do I have to include both lines? The error is caused by the same value set but it is used in more than one StructureDefinition. In fact, it is used in several more, so this error is repeated several times, though they are all due to the<br>
'<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/pocd/CodeSystem/measurement-status">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/pocd/CodeSystem/measurement-status</a>' value set reference.</p>

<p>You have to suppress <em>every</em> message you want suppressed.  The process has zero clue over cause.  It's just filtering messages.  You can (and should) group suppression that are related to the same cause and provide a shared comment for all of them that explains why they're being suppressed.</p>

<p>If you have the same message that's appearing multiple places and you know that <em>everywhere</em> that message appears (now and in the future) is safe to ignore, you can copy the text following the path and skip the location.  E.g.<br>
<code>URL value 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/pocd/CodeSystem/measurement-status' does not resolve</code></p>
<p>Note that what you're flagging for suppression here seems odd.  Why don't those URLs resolve?</p>

<p>In this case that code system is defined by another IG (PoCD - Point of Care Devices) which is still a work in progress. PoCDs are much more complicated than PHDs so it's a lot more work. PHD and PoCD are working together to try and harmonize as much as possible so where we can share things, we do.</p>
<p>I tried skipping the location and it did not work. I have the following:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code># The following code system is not yet supported by the terminology server. This oid identifies the Nomenclature (MDC)
# code system defined in IEEE 11073 10101 and used by both PoCD and PHD devices. There are several value sets and code
# systens defined in the PHD and PcOCD implementation guides which are based upon this same MDC code system which causes
# problems when referencing them.
Error from server: Unable to provide support for code system urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101
Code System URI &quot;urn:iso:std:iso:11073:10101&quot; is unknown so the code cannot be validated

# This profile is not something that can be implemented. It represents only those elements that are common to all PHD Observational profiles.
The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this profile

<p>I have some other odd behaviors I have had when editing this file. Is there any thing that it cached such that changes in my file are ignored (the local build)?</p>

<p>In this case I cannot make examples for that profile as one cannot instantiate it. All it has are elements common to all Observation profiles. By itself it has no values! I used that approach to avoid having to write the same xml over and over again in each of the profiles. It also avoids the problems associated with a change being made in that 'base' and having to repeat it N times in all N profiles that use it.</p>

<p>If it's an ancestor, that's fine.  But you suppress the message for that specific profile, not for all profiles<br>
If you want to use a value set from another IG, you must declare a dependency on that IG.  You should not copy the valueset.</p>

<p>It looks like you have only few warning and a lot of errors - AFAIK, you cannot suppress errors</p>

<p>When suppressing, make sure you're copying the messages from qa.txt, not qa.html.  Vassil is correct - errors can't be suppressed.  (And if you're going to suppress warnings, you need to provide a reason that's convincing to the FMG.)</p>

<p>Also, you will need to move to the template-based publication mechanism before you can go to ballot</p>

<p>Can you migrate your IG to the standard HL7 FHIR template?  That'll likely fix your problem.  And if not, it'll certainly make diagnosing easier.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> Is there any documentation about how to perform the migration to the template?  I've tried replacing the old framework folder with the HL7 template folder (with all necessary files) but I get an error stating "cannot find framework" when I try to publish.</p>

<p>You won't have a framework folder.  The template folder will be automatically created for you.  All you need is an ig.ini that points to the proper template.  There's documentation here: <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/ig-guidance/using-templates.html">http://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/ig-guidance/using-templates.html</a>.  You might also look at the <a href="https://github.com/fhir/sample-ig">https://github.com/fhir/sample-ig</a> as a model.</p>
