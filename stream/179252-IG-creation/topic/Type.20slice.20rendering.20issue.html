<p>If you take a look at the differential here: <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-sdoh-clinicalcare/StructureDefinition-SDOHCC-Observation-ScreeningResponseBase-1.html">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-sdoh-clinicalcare/StructureDefinition-SDOHCC-Observation-ScreeningResponseBase-1.html</a> and look at effective[x], you'll see that the effectivePeriod slice is listed twice - once because it's one of the allowed types in the base and once because there's a specific slice declared in the differential.  Also, the slices are rendered differently.  The slices should only appear once and should be consistent in rendering whether constrained or not.</p>

<p>the slice isn't listed twice. The first time, it shows the possible types for the base, and then it displays the slices</p>

<p>effective[x] is labeled as "Slice Definition".  Listing effectiveDate as an allowed element as well as a slice is redundant and confusing.  Intrinsically, if you've got a polymorphic type, your list of supported types is a list of slices.  If some are further constrained and others aren't, that shouldn't affect how you're rendering them</p>

<p>perhaps. I'm just explaining why it is how it is. Making the change you propose isn't quick and easy</p>

<p>I recognize that.  It's not a critical/urgent fix, but I think it should be added to the list of things to address at some point.  The way it is now is confusing.</p>
