<p>I need to fix the jira spec. The instructions say<br>
To make pull requests against this project, create a fork in your personal Github space and submit a pull request from there.<br>
but what is this with 'create a fork in your personal GitHub space'? First, I don't have a personal GitHub space unless the location of my IG is my personal space. But the only fork I can make there is of my IG. I can make a fork (I assume) in the main project but that is certainly not my personal space!!</p>
<p>What am I supposed to do here? Shall I create a fork in the main JIRA-Spec project?</p>
<p>I went ahead and did that and saw many others had also done it. I hope I didn't do anything bad.</p>

<p>If you have a Github userid, you have your own Github space.  (And if you don't have a Github user id, you can't make changes to HL7 specifications.)  When you make a fork using Github, the default is to create it in your personal space.  You won't have authority to create a new fork in the HL7 space, so it's very unlikely you did anything bad :)</p>
