<p>I am working on updating the Da Vinci Formulary IG to have a better navigation. I know there has been a push lately to harmonize the structure of IGs a bit more in order to make them useful. Is there a set of guidelines or exemplary IGs that we might use to guide our improvements?</p>

<p>I don't know of one that would be 'exemplary', but the general rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimize the number of pages, and ensure where you split pages that each has a clear purpose and doesn't require much navigation to use it</li>
<li>separate out "backaground" content that could theoretically be skimmed/ignored from the 'hard' conformance requirements</li>
<li>ensure that all important pages are navigable to from the menu and that all other pages are directly linked to from the text of the pages in the IG.</li>
<li>it should be possible for someone to fully navigate your IG without ever clicking on next/prev or ToC.</li>
<li>make liberal use of hyperlinks.  Assume that someone might start on any page of your IG, so make it easy to navigate from wherever they start to the key things they need to know.</li>
</ul>
