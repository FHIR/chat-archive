<p><a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core/StructureDefinition-us-core-relatedperson.html#profile">This profile</a> is derived from the base specification and as noted by a ballot commenter it has a preferred binding to the FHIR R4 relationshiptype valueset : <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-relatedperson-relationshiptype.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-relatedperson-relationshiptype.html</a>.  But this binding is not rendered in the differential view but is rendered in the "snapshot" and "must support" views.  I think the inherited bindings should be displayed in the diff too.  Would like others to chime in on this feature (or let me know if I have missed something).</p>

<p>the point of the diff is to know what's changed, so it doesn't render that stuff</p>

<p>Agree with Grahame.  The purpose of the diff is only to show differences.  It is not to show "important" information.  Insofar as that exists right now, "important" things show up on the mustSupport tab - though it needs rework to actually expose all 'important' things.</p>

<p>+1 to Grahame/Lloyd - many commenters think that the differential view should is the place to see the important information but it isn't.  if this profile didn't change the binding, then it shouldn't show on the differential.  The Snapshot Must Support clearly shows the binding.</p>
