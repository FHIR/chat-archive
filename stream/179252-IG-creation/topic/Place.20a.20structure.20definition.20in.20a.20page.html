<p>What is the magic syntax to place a structure definition in the resources folder in a page file (using markdown)?<br>
Would the syntax used by Simplifier {{tree:phd/CompoundNumericObservation}}</p>
<p>Probably not. There is probably a different syntax for Jekyll. Any docs on that?</p>
<p>I'm trying to validate a structure definition by making a minimal IG with one page containing one resource - (a structure definition) and that will be the structure definition I want to check.</p>

<p>That must be pretty generic. I am still searching the wiki and other IG guides to figure out what the ?? possibilities are (kind of view).</p>
<p>So far I got<br>
{% include StructureDefinition-{PhdDevice}-{??}.xhtml%}</p>
<p>where PhdDevice is the &lt;id&gt; I give it in the structure definition. Forge had no such &lt;id&gt; in their definitions.</p>
<p>I don't have xhtml files either; they are xml.</p>

<p>Maybe I am trying to do something that can't be done. In Simplifier I could embed the structure definition right into a markdown page anywhere I wanted. In the IG publisher examples all I see is a table with a list of profiles that are not displayed in the page. I can click them and then see them but they are not present in the page themselves.</p>

<p>When I put in an xml-html such that I have {% include StructureDefinition-{PhdDevice}-{xml-html}.xhtml%} which I hope means I want to view my xml file as html at this point....BUT, <br>
the output says the 'liquid' (what a stupid name) syntax is in error, it should be like this: {% include file.ext param='value' param2='value' %}</p>
<p>Then it looks like if I do that {% include PhdDeviceStructureDefinition.xml  %} it can't find the file because it apparently does not look for <em>my source</em> but something it has already created and placed in the 'temp' directory.  Arrg.</p>
<p>So I go with this {% include PhdDeviceStructureDefinition.xhml  %} which exists in the temp directory after some processing BUT then I get it wants the file in an '_include' directory within the temp directory!!! That I can't do anything about.</p>
<p>I look on line and so far have not found any uses of 'include' that are inserting anything for example here <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/tags/" target="_blank" title="https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/tags/">https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/tags/</a></p>
<p>So if I want to view, as html, in a markdown page,  my PhdDeviceStructureDefinition.xml file with id PhdDevice located  in 'resources'  what should this line<br>
{% include StructureDefinition-{id}-{??}.xhtml%} inserted in the markdown file<br>
look like?</p>

<p>That's what I am doing. But the working IG does not embed a structure definition within text (like one can do in Simplifier). Instead it has links to the structure definitions which you click on and then you get a separate page with the differential and snapshot views</p>

<p>R4 (3.6.0 at the current moment). The version where the Device and DeviceComponent have been merged and the DeviceComponent no longer exists</p>
<p>the 'ig' seems the simplest. They are all more complex than my minimal guide which (if it worked) would only have a home page with a structure definition in it. I got the home page.</p>
<p>Also, is it necessary to name my resources with these dashes like 'StructureDefinition-PhdDevice.xml'? It seems like a lot examples I see all do this. Coming down from Forge and Simplifier I have all markdown pages and structure definition resources with names like PhdDeviceStructureDefinition.xml. These structure definitions are all embedded within the markdown files with annotations that look like this</p>
<p>{{tree:phd/CompoundNumericObservation}}</p>
<p>where the structure definition is CompoundNumericObservation.xml</p>

<p>I am trying to follow how the process goes from the structure definition in the resources directory ... for example the file 'test-ig-sd.out.xml to a line like this <br>
{% include StructureDefinition-test-organization-diff.xhtml %}<br>
in the profile-sd-o.html in the pages directory </p>
<p>That line produces the differential (or snapshot should I replace 'diff' with 'snapshot') but I have no idea how the syntax of the line relates to the source files in the resources directory. But I see only two structure definitions in the resources directory (besides the implementation guide). How do the source xml files relate to that 'liquid' line above? I could not find a structure definition with an id 'test-organization'. Both SDs are Patients and I cannot find the word 'organization' anywhere in the source files in 'resource'. Isn't &lt;test-organization&gt; supposed to be an SD id?</p>
<p>SUCCESS!  I used the line {% include StructureDefinition-PhdDevice-diff.xhtml %} and it worked. I now have a minimal IG which makes your test IG look like New York City next to my Maria, Australia IG. </p>
<p>I still don't understand the connection between that line and the sources in the test ig though.</p>

<p>I don't know. Lloyd got his hands on that and did the Lloyd thing and now it's really complicated</p>

<p>Well this is pretty simple with small ig.json and ImplementationGuide.xml structure definition files. For thick skulls like mine with limited capacity it's a good starting point. </p>
<p>Now I can easily view my structure definitions and see if they have what I want in the diff and snapshot views.</p>
<p>Now I got to see why some of my difference fields are not showing up in the 'diff' (or snapshot). I've got some learning to do there as well!</p>

<p>I am trying to follow how the process goes from the structure definition in the resources directory ... for example the file 'test-ig-sd.out.xml to a line like this <br>
{% include StructureDefinition-test-organization-diff.xhtml %}<br>
in the profile-sd-o.html in the pages directory</p>
</blockquote>
<p>right now the config.json file defines:  ( in the near future will be moved to the IG resource file  ( ig.xml)</p>
<ul>
<li>source file  ( file url)</li>
<li>base file -  the html page  [type]+[id].html</li>
<li>may define the definition page and mapping page too.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all based on the resource id</p>
<p>also defines where every lives  (pages, resources, examples , etc)</p>
<p>right now ig.xml use is a bit murky, its necessary for some things,  just assume you need it for all resources  ( you don't but ignore that ), fill in all the metadata and  populate it with the resources,  only need to stub in the home page .</p>
<p>This is all based on the resource id.</p>
<p>With this set up correctly you will have a bunch of prepackaged paramaters:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Jekyll Site Variables
These are the site variables defined here:

IG Business version specification (defined in ig.json)- {{site.data.fhir.ig.version}} = 0.0.0

IG status (defined in ig.xml)- {{site.data.fhir.ig.status}} = draft

Whether is experimental IG (defined in ig.xml) - {{site.data.fhir.ig.experimental}} = false

IG Publisher name (defined in ig.xml) - {{site.data.fhir.ig.publisher}} = Health eData Inc

dependency url - e.g. “uscore” : Base url of a dependency implementation Guide (defined in ig.json) - {{site.data.fhir.uscore}} = http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core

igName : Title of the implementation Guide (defined in ig.xml) - {{site.data.fhir.igName}} = IG_Test3

path : path to the main FHIR specification (defined in ig.json)- {{site.data.fhir.path}} = http://build.fhir.org/

canonical : canonical path to this specification (defined in ig.json)- {{site.data.fhir.canonical}} = http://www.fhir.org/guides/test3

errorCount : number of errors in the build file (not including HTML validation errors) - {{site.data.fhir.errorCount}} = 18

version : version of FHIR - {{site.data.fhir.version}} = 3.6.0

revision : revision of FHIR - {{site.data.fhir.revision}} = 8660b499

versionFull : version-revision - {{site.data.fhir.versionFull}} = 3.6.0-8660b499

totalFiles : total number of files found by the build - {{site.data.fhir.totalFiles}} = 9

processedFiles : number of files genrated by the build - {{site.data.fhir.processedFiles}} = 146

genDate : date of generation (so date stamps in the pages can match those in the conformance resources) - {{site.data.fhir.genDate}} = Tue, Sep 11, 2018 09:22-0700
</pre></div>


<p>since the ig-pub generates all the resource fragments - the liquid tagging in the templates is good to go..</p>
<p>{{type}}  and {{id}} are the variables  used to capture the fragments like <code>{% include {{[type]}}-{{[id]}}-pseudo-json.xhtml %}</code>  will inject the psuedo json from for a profile into the page</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span>  I am a little confused about the mentioning of ig.xml and ig.json. This morning I was able to create a minimal IG with only a page and a structure definition. I needed an ig.json file and an ImplementationGuide.xml structure definition. I added the page and a Device structure definition. The ig and ImplementationGuide.xml were both small because they referenced only a single page and resource.</p>
<p>In my page file I used {% StructureDefinition-PhdDevce-diff-xhtml %}. This gave me a nice view of the diff.</p>
<p>Is ig.xml you are talking about the same as my ImplementationGuide.xml structure definition?</p>
