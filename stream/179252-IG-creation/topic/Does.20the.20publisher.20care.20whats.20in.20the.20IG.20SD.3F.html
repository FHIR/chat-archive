<p>Does the IG Publisher care what's in the ImplementationGuide structure definition? I have an xhtml page in the pages directory and I did not put it in the ImplementationGuide.xml. But it was rendered anyways. I had another page that was referenced in the ImplementationGuide and it made no difference whether I set the 'generation' parameter to html or markdown.</p>
<p>How is this file used?</p>

<p>Being in the ImplementationGuide is necessary if you're using the built-in breadcrumbs and ToC.  It'll also generate page "wappers" for pages that don't include header and footer content.</p>
