<p>I have provenance history in one of my IG for the changes happening to a CodeSystem. It was brought to my attention that my Bundle might not have the references as proper references. The Bundle is of type collection, which I think is right. Each entry is a Provenance resource. What is in dispute is if the fullUrl should be a full URL, or should be a UUID? I had built full URLs off of the root of the IG. Is this right, or should these be urn:uuid:&lt;uuid&gt; values?</p>
