<p>I have several errors in the QA for my IG that look like this<br>
URL value '<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/pocd/CodeSystem/measurement-status">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/pocd/CodeSystem/measurement-status</a>' does not resolve<br>
I assume such errors are due to the fact these IG (pocd and PHD) are not yet published? It's been more than a year since I have looked at anything but Bluetooth and I think that was the case. Once published, these URLs should resolve, correct?</p>
