<p>I am building the IG guide using Lloyd's Framework and I see this line at the end<br>
Errors: 560  Warnings: 360  Info: 106 (00:02:04.0809sec)<br>
yet the guide builds.</p>
<p>What are the errors and how can I see them?</p>
<p>Also, I have a bundle example that causes a build failure in the validator when I include it. How can I get more information so I can find out what the validator is complaining about?</p>

<p>The errors and warnings are in qa.html.  A successful build just means there weren't any fatal errors.  Before your IG is ready to publish, it should be down to 0 errors and warnings.  In terms  of the bad example, there should be some hints as to the reason for failure in the stack trace associated with the build failure.</p>

<p>There is no qa.html anywhere in /temp or there project as a whole. Is it somewhere else like in the .fhir directory?</p>

<p>Okay, so a null pointer exception puts an end to that. I will comment out the bundle resource and repeat so I can examine these errors</p>

<p>I think the NPE is because you have a resource in one of your Bundle entries that doesn't have an <code>id</code> element.  Can you double check that?  If that fixes the problem, you can also submit a change request suggesting that the validator should fail a bit more gracefully if that happens.</p>

<p>All the Observation resources contain no logical id because they are being created or conditionally created. I give them temporary ids but since this is a transaction bundle the ids are placed in the 'fullURL' element of the entry and there is no id. That is done by HAPI FHIR.</p>

<p>Ok. I've pushed up a fix that may address your issue.  After it's built, merged, rebuilt and published, you can grab the new validator and try again.  I'll ping here when that's happened.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> I did not know about the qa.html. Pretty handy. Wish I knew about that a few months ago.  I am getting an error on something I am not even sure I wrote. Its a link to the implementation guide in the resources.md. The link looks like this</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&lt;ul&gt;{% include list-simple-implementationguides.xhtml %}&lt;/ul&gt;

<p>All the other 'list-simple-*' work. What is it looking for?</p>

<p>The fixed worked. But I will say that all my transaction bundles have NUMEROUS errors mostly due to unable to find referenced resources (temporary ids)</p>
