<p>My understanding is that recently, there was a decision to replace the NUCC Taxonomy Code System URL: the published URL is <a href="http://nucc.org/provider-taxonomy">http://nucc.org/provider-taxonomy</a> while the new one is <a href="http://www.nucc.org/taxonomy">http://www.nucc.org/taxonomy</a> and that this change has already been incorporated in the Da Vinci Plan-Net IG. <br>
However, for the new URL, IG Publisher returns an error "Unable to provide support for code system <a href="http://www.nucc.org/taxonomy">http://www.nucc.org/taxonomy</a>". I'm wondering whether this is a known issue and whether it's expected to be resolved in a future version of the IG Publisher.</p>

<p>HTA is not intending to "override the balloted specification". We are engaging external code system owners, as requested by an HL7 community member, for authoritative information, including their officially sanctioned URL. It was our understanding that the IG process is supported by UTG's ability to support the existence of multiple identifiers within namingsystem resources, to support the reality that URLs may need to be updated over time, similar to the change that was made for ICD10PCS. The JIRA request to have this change offically made in UTG, and passed through the commnity notifcation process in UTG, is in the works. However, it is HTAs designated role to be "responsible for the creation, implementation, and management of HL7 processes involving external terminology management"</p>

<p>I want to confirm Carol's response. HTA has an HL7 board charge to do the work of determining use of external terminologies in HL7 artifacts, specifically to work with the code system authority to determine the canonical url. Given the known situation where HL7 artifacts would have to define "a canonical url" before the authority decided to weigh in, we created a situation where a canonical url could, and has, changed. UTG has a process (that still needs a bit of work) to notify the community of these changes and we have chosen to keep track of these changes via NamingSystem and the provenance of the CodeSystem. To our understanding the community does not get to disregard the desires of an external IP owner. What they do need is clear notification and a tooling system that helps them deal with this change.</p>

<p>Yes,  I am.  Someone followed HL7 process to have the HTA determine if the existing URL was an appropriate URL (given that it resolves to a 404) and the code system owner said "ooh, no, we want this URL" and the HTA is following its process to inform the community and affect the change.</p>

<p>Where did the original NUCC Health Care Provider Taxonomy URL come from?  (the <a href="http://www.nucc.org/provider-taxonomy">http://www.nucc.org/provider-taxonomy</a> one)?  If it came from NUCC originally, then I agree with you and Lloyd.  But it doesn't sound like that is the case.</p>

<p>Thanks, that was my first question way earlier today. :)<br>
So it appears that we have a case of a Code System URL that HL7/FHIR defined that has ended up not being the official URL that the code system owner desires.  What should be the process for the code system owner in this case?</p>

<p>okay, it appears to me that their process was:<br>
0) HL7/FHIR makes up a URL for a code system without consulting the external authority<br>
1) HTA gets asked to verify the URL<br>
2) HTA consults with the external authority<br>
3) External Authority indicates that the made-up URL is incorrect and provides a proper URL<br>
4) HTA documents the proposed change and submits it through the HL7-terminology-change-process</p>

<p>HL7 isn't bound to use the URI that the code system authority would like.  It's absolutely a consideration, but it's not the only consideration.  Making the code system authority happy, but costing our developer community hundreds of thousands of dollars (or more) isn't necessarily the best outcome.  HTA assigning a URL where there isn't already one defined is fine.  HTA assigning a URL where one is defined and published by FHIR - irrespective of whether the responsible terminology owner was involved - should <em>only</em> happen with consultation with the HL7 implementer community.</p>

<p>If we go <em>way back</em> to Igor's original question, I think it is obviously premature for the Da Vinci Plan Net IGuide to incorporate the new code system URL into their value set definition.  Although NUCC has made that request of HL7, the correct URL is <em>still</em> <a href="http://www.nucc.org/provider-taxonomy">http://www.nucc.org/provider-taxonomy</a> so that would be incorrect on the part of the authors of that Implementation Guide.</p>

<p>Totally agree with you here!  My argument is that the HTA has not "assigned a URL" yet.  It has simply consulted with the code system authority to find out their wishes.</p>

<p>If there's one that pre-exists, the HTA should: a) find that out before starting the discussion and; b) try to get a sense of how widely used that URI is within existing systems; c) start their conversation with the terminology owner on that basis - generally with a desired outcome of keeping the one that exists, though perhaps setting up a redirect to the location where the data actually exists or updating our documentation for the code system to refer to that URL.</p>

<p>If they did indeed advise the IG Author to use this new URL, then that is out-of-line.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span> Since the NUCC Health Care Provider Taxonomy is still undergoing the UTG Change process, can the HTA place a disclaimer on that confluence page stating something to the effect that this is what NUCC has proposed and that there is an existing Code System URL and that the UTG process is still being followed?</p>
<p>That would distinguish this page from the other pages which were documenting valid URLs and such.</p>

#4/5 appear to be about reviewing and confirm the use of the external code system in existing artifacts.  I believe that Lloyd's proposal of adding a community engagement step at this point should be inserted.  You may very well be doing that but being explicit would be good here.<br>

<p>I'll just say here that it news to me, and I suspect to others, that HL7 never intended to support external code system owner requests to use a requested canonical url when that request comes after HL7 has made up their own id. If there is some documentation of valid effort to obtain the desired url from the authority, I suspect that would be important for HTA to see and I would have expected, given the widely announced role of HTA, that they - HTA - would have been notified of such actions "by the community." This street goes both ways methinks. </p>
<p>As for the Plan-Net folks using the official NUCC url - that is on me. NUCC is pretty concerned about HL7's appropriation of their IP (of additional note, it seems they would like to see the use of NUCC changed within US Core.) But the plan-net change was due to my understanding, that I still think is correct, that the IP owner sets the url. I just assumed you all knew such changes would occur and had planned to support it because this has been discussed <strong>many times</strong> wrt the consequences of making up urls to get things published. Seems we've not completed that discussion.</p>

<p>If a terminology owner's licensing terms dictate the specific URL that must be used, we're bound to use it - unless we can negotiate other licensing terms.  However, few if any terminology owner's license terms ever assert such a thing.  (Must terminology owners would have no notion that a URI would even be relevant.)  As such, so long as we use the terminology within the bounds of the license terms, HL7 is free to dictate whatever URI it wishes.  It is certainly good practice to seek a URI from the terminology owner, but in cases where one has already been assigned, we need to be careful.  Existing implementations matter - and in at least some cases, they're going to matter more than the preference of the terminology owner.  We have a better process now than we did before, but that doesn't mean that the new process can ignore prior art when doing so negatively impacts the implementer community.  Implementers could care less what process we used to get the URL.  That's not their problem.  But if we change the URL, it is we (HL7) who are creating a tremendous problem.  We shouldn't do that without really good cause - and terminology owner preference doesn't necessarily constitute such.</p>

<p>Let it be known, let it be written...<br>
NUCC has agreed to <strong>not change the canonical url</strong> and is accepting the canonical url that was crafted by HL7 and is included in <a href="http://terminology.hl7.org">terminology.hl7.org</a> and in the base FHIR servers. That url is <a href="http://nucc.org/provider-taxonomy">http://nucc.org/provider-taxonomy</a>. They note that this "dashed" url will not resolve and may never resolve. I have updated the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TA/National+Uniform+Claim+Committee+%28NUCC%29+Health+Care+Provider+Taxonomy">HTA NUCC page</a> to indicate this decision. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="231038">@Gail Kocher</span> was responsible for this approval and will contact <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191393">@Igor Sirkovich</span> so that he can update the Plan-Net build to use the new-old official url. </p>
<p>I want to mention that this was done in the spirt of responsiveness that I'd like to assume <em>all</em> FHIR participants will exhibit as we address important issues wrt FHIR terminology. The process that allows IP owners the ability to define the canonical url for content they own does exist and we clearly need to improve how that is conducted. </p>
<p>I also want to point out that there remain some serious problems with the representation of the NUCC provider taxonomy within the FHIR core that continues to concern NUCC, specifically the addition of made-up codes. NUCC expects those codes to be removed - please see <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-27023?jql=project%3D%22FHIR%22%20AND%20text~%22provider%20taxonomy%22">FHIR-27023</a>. We need to resolve this tracker and I'm hopeful this bright shinning light will help that happen.</p>

<p>I tend to agree with Brett that this is an issue that needs a meeting to resolve.  While the HTA was created by the BoD, it was not with the intent that the HTA would implement changes that break existing specs and implementations.  I can't believe HTA would knowingly do so either. In the future, there needs to be an impact assessment before such changes are rolled out, and there should have been more dialogue with the affected community.  But it may not be clear to the HTA how best to do that.  So we need more clarity about how to make HTA work more effectively with the FHIR community and WGs in the future.  I don't know who actually talked to whom, but I'd also question whether NUCC would have required this change if they knew it would break existing FHIR specs.   So clearly we need to improve the communication process as well as bring this issue to resolution.   And I just saw Rob's response which at least alleviates the urgency.  But we need to improve the process before it happens again.</p>
