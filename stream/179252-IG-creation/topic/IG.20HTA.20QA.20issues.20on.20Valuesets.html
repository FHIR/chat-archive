<p>I am getting a number of issues identified in the HTA report (<a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/branches/v1.0.9/qa-hta.html">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/branches/v1.0.9/qa-hta.html</a>). It is complaining about the copyright. These ValueSets largely include multiple code systems and we have rolled up the copyright notice into the Valueset copyright.<br>
Is this going to be an issue for publishing? We are trying to open a peer review for an STU Update this Friday.</p>

<p>You must include specific verbiage for each code system in the copyright for the value set.  There's pre-approved verbiage for LOINC, SNOMED, CPT, etc.  You must include that text with no deviations.</p>

<p>OK, but these are valueSets that include multiple codeSystems with their own copyrights.  None of the individual codeSystem copyrights are showing an error.  How can I express more than one copyright for a valueset?</p>

<p>you put the exact text for each code system that is included in the value set in the ValueSet.copyright.  Here's an example of one of my value sets with CPT and X12 codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>^copyright = "Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) is copyright 2020 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.<br>

<p>OK. Perhaps there is a behind the scenes markdown issue (e.g. html link vs markdown link). <br>
For verification, what is the right source for these copyrights? I was told to use the IP Information and Licensing Information from pages like this: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97453705">https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97453705</a><br>

<p>probably ask this on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179202" href="/#narrow/stream/179202-terminology">#terminology</a>. but FMG won't quibble about the fine details - the HTA check is still a work in progress. As long as you have some copyright statement that covers the base, that will be acceptable. It's aimed at catching IGs that haven't tried</p>

<p>No.  That is from an already published guide.  If you want those changed, you’ll need to get the build validation changed because all ig developers are following what the Qa spits out.</p>

<p>After further review I understand the HTA external terminology pages a little more. I thought all of the information contained in the IP and licensing info was meant to be put in the copyright information, but it turns out those are the terms of use which does include copyright language.  It would be nice if there was a row only for what is required to be in the copyright so it would clearly pointed out. I was able to resolve all of those issues where a copyright was included on the page. That being said, what should appear for ICD9 and ICD10? It is not clear on the HTA confluence page and I am getting an hta qa issue stating that <em>(copyright expectations unknown)</em>.</p>
<p>US Core uses "ICD-9 and ICD-10 are copyrighted by the World Health Organization (WHO) which owns and publishes the classification. See <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en">https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en</a>. WHO has authorized the development of an adaptation of ICD-9 and ICD-10 to ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM for use in the United States for U.S. government purposes."<br>
Should I just use that?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191529">@Corey Spears</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span>  That copyright statement from US Core does not appear correct to me as (I assume) US Core is using ICD9CM and ICD10CM, the US based clinical modifications of the WHO ICD9 and ICD10. Thus the copyright statements you have in that HTA error message are consistent with what HTA has recommended as it describes NCHS's (who authors and publishes ICD9CM and ICD10CM into the public domain) policy.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191529">@Corey Spears</span> to get past the IG Publisher's QA Report, you don't need anything for ICD.

<p>Ah, now I understand what you're asking.  I haven't included any copyright statements for ICD9/10 because I was waiting for what it should be.  When I read what is on the HTA site, it doesn't really give me concrete guidance of what to put.  The statement that US-Core has seems in line with what the HTA pages say, so if you wanted to put something, that would seem appropriate, except that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="195036">@Carol Macumber</span> said it wasn't.</p>
