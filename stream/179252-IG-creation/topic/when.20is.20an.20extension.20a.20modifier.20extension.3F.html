<p>In a non-HL7 IG, I've had a reviewer insist that a lot of my extensions are modifier extensions.  The argument comes down to the phrase in the core spec: "modifies the meaning of the element that contains it".  <br>
I have an End Reason extension to provide a reason why an Address, Name, ContactPoint, etc. were ended.  The reviewer asserts that it negates the meaning of the thing it is attached to.  I don't think it does negate or modify, it's just providing additional information.  <br>
While that might be clear, I also have a Date of Death extension for a Practitioner.  I similarly make the argument that it doesn't change the meaning of the rest of the elements on Practitioner.  It might change the business actions that occur for the Practitioner, but I don't think it modifies the meaning of Practitioner or any of its elements.<br>
Is the rule around whether something is a modifier extension as simple as "would downstream processing of the resource be different if the extension wasn't present"?</p>

<p>no. what wouldn't be a modifier under those rules? If you put an extension on that says 'this is not a practitioner' then that's a modifier. If you put an extension on that says 'this is a practitioner, but you might want to know X' then that's not a modifier, no matter how important X is to someone.</p>
