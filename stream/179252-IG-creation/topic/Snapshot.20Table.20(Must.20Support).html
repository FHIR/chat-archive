<p>Is the assumption correct that only the elements with the flag mustSupport = true are shown in the Snapshot Table (Must Support) and required elements (min = 1) with mustSupport = false are not shown? Has this always been the case or has something changed?</p>

<p>That is correct and has always been the case.  There's a proposal to replace the mustSupport page with something different - that includes mandatory elements, modifier elements, elements with invariants not defined in the core resource and other elements of key interest to implementers, however that hasn't happened yet.</p>

<p>What is the current content of the "Snapshot Table (Must Support)" tab? I'm looking at it, and I don't see any elements flagged as MS. Is the view documented anywhere like diff, snapshot, xml, and json are?</p>
<p>(It also isn't what I expect when I see the phrase "snapshot table" -- it needs a better title to convey that it is filtered, key elements from the profile or parents.)</p>

<p>The only elements that show up there (right now) are those that are MS, so the MS flag isn't displayed as it would be redundant.  There's a proposal to shift the view to include other key elements (mandatory elements, modifier elements, etc.).  If we do that, the MS elements would be flagged again.</p>

<p>Filtering on flags?</p>
