<p>The example file is xml (IPS-bundle-01.xml), not json.  It hasn't been changed, and it was building OK (with some errors) before.  Has anyone seen this or have ideas how to fix it?</p>

<p>In the IPS IG build I have multiple (&gt;100) instances of a new error:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Internal error in location for message: &#39;Error in ?? at 1, 1: Found / expecting a token name&#39;, loc = &#39;/Users/rhausam/git-repo/fhir-ips/output/StructureDefinition-Composition-uv-ips.html#/html/head/body/&#39;, err = &#39;The image source &#39;icon_fixed.gif&#39; cannot be resolved&#39;
</pre></div>


<p>I'm not seeing those errors in the LIVD IG, so it doesn't appear to be a universal issue.  In trying to track this down, I'm not finding any mention of icon_fixed (with or without the .gif) anywhere in the source for either the ig or IG Publisher, so I'm not sure where this is coming from or at this point what to do about it.</p>

<p>I guess the icon isn't fixed. Chasing these errors is driving me crazy. "Clean build" doesn't happen if you use a code from outside an extensible value set. "Clean build" doesn't happen if you use a code system that is unsupported. "Clean build" doesn't happen because publisher and FHIR bugs (we've got a strange one involving documentreference URI that isn't in our code).</p>

<p>code systems not supported <em>should</em> be warnings (which you can then suppress).  Agree that the tooling issues are frustrating.  We're continuously working to up the bar and as the tools change, we need to adjust.  The biggest challenge is that it can be hard for most folks to differentiate between "that's a Grahame problem, I can ignore" vs. "that's something I have to fix".</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with "fair".  It has to do with capacity.  Changes get made when there is time to make them.  Sometimes the change is incremental and things are broken in the mean-time.  They'll get fixed.  No one is going to yell at you because of the missing gif.  It's annoying noise right now, but it's not an actual "problem" you're responsible for fixing.</p>

<p>The id and url stuff is a policy that's been in place for a few months, but it's only now being enforced by the tools (in part because everyone was ignoring the policy).  It's unfortunate that it's manifesting now, but Grahame (and I and others) will work with the relevant authors to help them comply.</p>

<p>It is too late. I'm signing off for the weekend and whatever errors are there -- which by the way are NOT affecting the quality  of our IGs -- are just going to have to stay there. Nothing is perfect, but we are close enough to not go through these ridiculous fire drills.</p>

<p>Technically, the errors <em>are</em> affecting the quality of your IGs, albeit in a minor way.  The missing GIF means that all of the snapshot and differential diagrams you have for profiles that include patterns will not render quite right.   The issues about implementation guide id and canonical URL issues mean that your IG won't load properly into the FHIR registry.  However, it's ok for you to sign off.  We'll get it figured out and manually patch if need-be.</p>

<p>Thank you, Lloyd. I understand you and Grahame and others are working extremely hard to improve the IG process, and I appreciate it. Excuse my grumpiness. The endless spin cycle of thinking we're done, but then we're not done, and done again, but then  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193599">@Lynn Laakso</span> communicates new requirements, so we aren't done, etc...

<p>It's all documented in the wiki on how to create IGs, but a lot of IG Authors don't necessarily read (or at least pay much attention) to that stuff.  They only care once the tooling yells at them - which it's now doing.  A bunch of those things are driven by templates.  Unfortunately we haven't (quite) migrated to a place where everyone uses a consistent template, which means that when one IG makes fixes that address the rules, that doesn't necessarily propagate to everyone.  (And a lot of IG authors just copy and paste from other IGs to start.)  I'm one of the main template authors and my IGs are currently broken due to what Grahame began enforcing last night.  I have to make some significant changes to make my stuff work again.  (And some of the rules he's enforcing can only be enforced in the context of HL7 ballot - not everywhere,  and one of them will need to be tweaked.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191447">@Mark Kramer</span>  my apologies for the changes turning up so late. You may not believe it but I didn't set out to change the rules; an author preparing an IG for ballot reported an issue which I fixed, which (unexpectedly) fixed an issue somewhere else where rules were not being enforced</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  Apologies accepted. I know you are working hard and in good faith. But I have to say, regarding the ballot process for IGs, it  is a horrendous shit-show of committees, dates, rules, and requirements that is virtually impossible to navigate. Add to that the last-minute changes, and it is just too much. We have excellent resources at MITRE, but HL7  is killing us. Something has to be done to simplify the process.</p>

<p>I agree about the process. We are working on that (have you looked at Wayne's proposal to simplify the approval process?)</p>
<p>As for the technical process... we are constantly working to improve it. This round of publishing we moved a lot of the publishing quality work that I had just done in the background to the editors, so that I don't have to do the publishing, and we can scale the process. That hasn't been liked. </p>
<p>We were supposed to have moved to the new HL7 template, which would also have simplified the process a lot, but that missed the boat. Hopefully that'll be sorted out by next time. Otherwise, the IG publisher requires that you dot your i's and cross your ts. I don't apologise for the policy, though I'm constantly trying to make the error messages better</p>

<p>having said all that,  I think it would be a worthwhile investment for Mitre to commit your issues to a document and send it to Austin (TSC chair) and Wayne (CTO)</p>

<p>Where does one find <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191808">@Wayne Kubick</span> 's proposal?  I have a proposal of my own, namely, that this become a project-centered process, not a committee-centered process. Each project should present to HL7 with all required authorities present three times: 1) at the outset of the project, 2) intermediate point, 3) when the project is ready to go to ballot. Let the committees come to the project, not the other way around.</p>

<p>I do not know where it is documented. It was presented to co-chairs several times but I don't know where things are now. But we desperately need to do something about it</p>

<p>The proposed process that's closest to being rolled out relates primarily to the PSS <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PSS/Business+Model+of+TSC+Project+Task+Force+%28TPTF%29+for+PSS%27s" target="_blank" title="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PSS/Business+Model+of+TSC+Project+Task+Force+%28TPTF%29+for+PSS%27s">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PSS/Business+Model+of+TSC+Project+Task+Force+%28TPTF%29+for+PSS%27s</a> .  Much more needs to be done. I see value in what @Mark Kramer proposes with more of a project0centered focus, but we haven't gotten very far yet.  I'm looking at ways to accelerate getting started on other process improvements before Atlanta.</p>
