<p>I just updates the publisher. What is the difference between the _gencontinuous.bat and the _genonce.bat files? I don't recall there being anything but the continuous one. However, if I use the continuous one, the build does not stop but repeats infinitely. The gen once behaves as I recall. I take it the continuous bat I need to avoid?</p>

<p>Both have been there since the beginning.  Continuous runs in the background and continues to update as you change files.  (Though in my experience eventually crashes).</p>
