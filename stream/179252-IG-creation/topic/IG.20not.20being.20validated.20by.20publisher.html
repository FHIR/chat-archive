<p>The IGPublisher isn't actually validating the ImplementationGuide resource.  For example, <a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhir-sdoh-clinicalcare/blob/master/input/sdoh-clinicalcare.xml">https://github.com/HL7/fhir-sdoh-clinicalcare/blob/master/input/sdoh-clinicalcare.xml</a> has both exampleBoolean and exampleCanonical on some elements.  If you run the validator on the IG file, it catches the problem.</p>
<p>I suspect the reason we're not running validation is because our 'source' IG files are not always valid against the version of FHIR they're authored for.  For example, we want to allow parameters that aren't supported in R4 but are in R5.  My concern is that spitting out invalid ImplementationGuides into the packages is eventually going to cause us grief.</p>
<p>The most appropriate solution is probably to require that implementation guides be valid against the source and make heavy use of extensions to deal with the limitations of the older versions, but that's going to be disruptive to both existing IGs and tools.</p>

<p>agree that they're not being validated, and they should be. Don't have any bright ideas for downstream consequences</p>

<p>Perhaps the short term solution is to start validating the IGs and have the FMG be tolerant of errors that stem from the fact that we're doing some slightly non-conformant things in earlier releases while we work to get inter-version-conversion working better?</p>
