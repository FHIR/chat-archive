<p>I am running the _gencontinuous.bat file and continuous is an understatement. It continues and never stops. Looks like it keeps recycling and going back to the start and redoing the build.<br>
Anyone experience this problem? Anyone know how to fix it or why it is happening?<br>
Thanx<br>
Brian</p>

<p>a) Why are you running _gencontinuous.bat?  <br>
b) is your IG using FSH files?</p>
<p>I suspect that the -watch command to the publisher doesn't take into account that the resource input files are changed when SUSHI runs.  That would mean that it does run over and over again because the resource files change.  I'm not positive about that but I did browse the code to see.</p>

My bad. I forgot. That USED to be the name of the local build file ages ago or something close to that. Can teach an old dog new tricks,</p>
