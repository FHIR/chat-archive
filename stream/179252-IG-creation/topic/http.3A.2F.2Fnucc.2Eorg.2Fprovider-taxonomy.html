<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191982">@Ted Klein</span> this is a problem with UTG - the UTG definition of this code system does not have these codes which are valid. Nor does it have the definitions of the abstract groupers that we also need (btw <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span> any progress with regard to the codes for the groupers?)</p>
<p>In fact, UTG has 2 definitions for this code system - why? </p>
<p>How to resolve? Should the IG publisher just ignore any definitions for this code system in UTG?</p>

<p>Regarding arriving at an approach with NUCC on codes for the abstract groupers: Working on it right now. My recommendation is that as a temporary solution we continue to keep the grouper concepts in the code system with the fake codes and mark the concepts as abstract. I understand that is likely different from what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191982">@Ted Klein</span>  was previously told to do by HTA (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="195036">@Carol Macumber</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="235766">@Julie James</span> ) for UTG. I will get official confirmation from NUCC as soon as possible. Any alternative solution is much less desirable. I'll also note it would technically help if we could somehow computably restrict those codes from showing up in any expansion. I understand this means expansions could not show the hierarchies but if that is what the NUCC requires of us after we finish our discussion, then I'd like to be able to offer this as s part of the solution - if it is possible. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> - thoughts?</p>

<p>Right ow I am grappling with a problem with the Publisher where we have a number of v3 Value Sets that include abstract grouper codes and in a few of these there are no concrete codes under them - hence the Expansion is not generated as it would be empty (no concepts).   This then triggers validation errors that the value set cannot be found for other value sets that include these.    Trying to find a workaround... <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> Any ideas on how we can deal with this?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191982">@Ted Klein</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span>  thanks. </p>
<ul>
<li>I agree that leaving the abstract codes in for now, marked as abstract, is the right thing to do. And they are marked as abstract now</li>
</ul>
<p>However:</p>
<ul>
<li>I still do not understand why some NUCC codes - not abstract ones - are not present in UTG, and these are causing validation for people now that UTG is working</li>
<li>It's wrong to automatically restrict the codes from appearing in any expansion whatever because there are some expansions where you want them to appear in the expansions (routing logic / decision support etc). You can specify non-abstract codes if that's appropriate, when you are picking actual concrete codes</li>
<li>value sets that have no content - how can I reproduce this?</li>

<p>OK working through these...the missing NUCC codes - they are in FHIR?   ie in (or not in) the v3 source from the December 2019 release?  (that is what was imported to UTG this Spring).   If they are/were not in the v3 source, then they are not in UTG as NO content from external (non-HL7) code systems was imported from FHIR to UTG.   <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span> if you let me know what Is missing and needs to be in there, I can get it into UTG.

<p>I think HTA and Rob M are trying to work out what to be done with NUCC.   We have a v3 value set - v3-Prosthodontics - that has the following:      &lt;compose&gt;<br>
    &lt;include&gt;<br>
      &lt;system value="http://nucc.org/provider-taxonomy"/&gt;<br>
      &lt;filter&gt;<br>
        &lt;property value="concept"/&gt;<br>
        &lt;op value="is-a"/&gt;<br>
        &lt;value value="1223P0700Y"/&gt;<br>
      &lt;/filter&gt;<br>
    &lt;/include&gt;<br>
  &lt;/compose&gt;    and the code 1223P0700Y is not in the v3  code system stub for NUCC or anything - you did make the change in the Publisher so that expansions are generated if their definitions include enumerated codes even if the code system is unknown to the server or to the IG - but that is working for the internal UTG code systems but not for this one whose enumerated code is drawn from NUCC.  Methinks we do want to generate these expansions from enumerated &lt;compose&gt; statements even if we are clueless about the code system source; probably should trigger a warning, but generate the expansion anyway.   What do you think?</p>

<p>Actually methinks that if the IG has an entry for an external code system in the &lt;special-url&gt; parameter then we DO absolutely want to not generate errors and do what we can - because the existence of such a parameter indicates that the value set CLD is deliberate, but the IG and server does not have access to the code system content.</p>

<p>I will wait for <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span> and HTA to let me know what needs to be done with this in UTG.  I also know that Paul Knapp and Mary Kay are working to get a bunch of X12 content so the implementers can use it.

<p>The dozen or more v3 value sets built on NUCC are ALL enumerated.   The v3 MIF publication never published the codes; the MIF definition of the code system is simply:      &lt;codeSystem name="nuccProviderCodes" title="NUCC Health Care Provider Taxonomy"<br>

                  &lt;p&gt;The Provider Taxonomy Code List is published (released) twice a year on July 1st and January 1st. The July publication is effective for use on October 1st and the January publication is effective for use on April 1st. The time between the publication release and the effective date is considered an implementation period to allow providers, payers and vendors an opportunity to incorporate any changes into their systems. This listing includes Active codes approved for use effective April 1st, 2003, version 3.0; and codes that are New and approved for use effective October 1st, 2003, version 3.1.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
                  &lt;p&gt;It was identified that there is an IP licensure issue with the republishing of the content for this code system by HL7, so the content was removed as of the July 2016 Harmonization cycle release.

<p>Oh criminal thanks for researching this.   Duh.  So much dross from v3 that was imported.    I will remove that second one ASAP clearly it is bad.   I see the harmonization cycle where it was added years ago also.   Sigh.      The first one should be retired/removed as well - I will make sure all of the value sets have the correct canonical URL for NUCC so they do not erroneously reference the other two bad ones.      Technically, by the vocab policy, I should to just removed them, they should be retired with the comment that they were erroneous.   I should remove the OID identifier elements from the as well I think.   Will that mask it from your server and Publishing operation?</p>

<p>I think that it shouldn't be imported to UTG. UTG is <em>governance</em> and publishing. So that anything that HL7 should publish, should be in UTG.

The big unknown to me right now is why Rob Hausam found the offending codes in NUCC, but you don't have then and Rob McClure thinks it is not right either.  WTF?    I think first we need to precisely describe and quantify the problem, ie what is missing from where, or wrong and needs correcting.

<p>Doing a bit of research on the NUCC site, it appears that at some point in the past, the last character of the code values was changed from "N" to "X".   All of the v3 code values in the enumerated value set definitions end with "N".  Upon cursory examination of a handful of them, the rest of the code string looks identical.    This beast was added to the v3 coremif in 2009.   The content was from earlier than that...and the NUCC site makes the old content available only back to 2009.   If a change was made that would account for it.   It is very possible that back in 2009 the content was added from the UMLS copy of the provider taxonomy as much of that was being done back then - this predates my taking over the harmonization stuff.   So we have a Situation where all of our older codes have been changed.</p>

<p>given that it's them that changed the codes, not us, then the way to handle this is put an entry in the UTG release notes saying that we've updated for changes, and implementers may need to review their implementations accordingly</p>

<p>I'm not sure they changed them, I am thinking more likely that whoever added them to v3 used a different source as NUCC was not making any machine readable data available back then.    All source I can find in the last 10 minutes of searching all use the "X".      I am liking your suggestion...the problem is smaller since HTA ordered us to remove the code system content so this is only three dozen or so value sets that have enumerated codes in them.   But there exists Vocabulary WG policy on such CLD changes...I need to make sure we are not running afoul of things in a way that will make the problem worse.</p>

<p>Right now I am trying to get agreement with the vocab chairs that we just make the change to the ValueSet.compose messes, and update the versions of the value sets, and document the issue in detail in the Provenance resources so it shows up in the History.</p>
