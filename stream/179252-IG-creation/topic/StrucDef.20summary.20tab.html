<p>My proposal:<br>
1. You change the IGPublisher to support hitting an Ant build script with the target names we'd agreed on and be able to point at a "template" IGPackage - including the ability to merge the properties in the 'template' IG with those from the local IG files<br>
2. I adapt my framework which is already Ant-driven and is sort of organized based on those steps already to work with the IGPublisher and we iterate until it actually runs<br>
3. We adapt the template to accomodate capabilities that Eric's framework already has<br>
4. We open up the template for more general feedback around appearance and capabilities (likely around the WGM)</p>

<p>5. We create a sample IG that explains gown to create an IG using the template<br>
6. We work to get Trifolia and Simplified to be able to publish using the template.<br>
7. We get John or someone to adapt the template for use with IHE.  (And decide if we should have a more generic template that we and others can adapt from.)<br>
8. We get everyone to adjust their IGs to use the template prior to ballot.<br>
In #3 we should be checking that Forge profiling will work..( <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191336">@Michel Rutten</span> I presume there's no interest from Firely in support for pure Forge- authored IGS in step 6?)</p>
<p>At some point in there (probably 3 or 4) we also need to rejig the IG publisher and template to support multi- version IGs.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> is the logical person to work in the IHE template. Question is whether IHE wants extra facilities around actors, or whether that should also be part of the HL7 template</p>

<p>Firely are certainly interested in Simplifier managed IGs, but I don't know whether they'll be interested in the template. OTOH, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191336">@Michel Rutten</span> I will probably up the requirements for HL7 published guides to look indistinguishable from the template (not sure how I'd express that)</p>

<p>I think storing and managing glossaries and actors definitions are two needs from IHE that would benefit other adopters. The lifecycle for those may be more evolved in IHE - we may end up with requirements for reusing /refining actors and transactions across domains, and maintaining those over time, so that in 2025 people can still be compatible with the 2019 version...</p>

<p>Tech editing will also bring some challenges - e.g. in a given edition of a profile we may include a new constraint, or 2 new supported use cases... we should find a way to track that.

<p>If you dump everything in resources, that should work.  But you should also be able to split stuff between resources, structures and vocabulary (there's good reasons to want those files separately).  And if you're driving multiple IGs from one project or you've got source files you don't necessarily want in your IG yet, you'll need to register the files in the IG.  You'll also need to register the files in the IG if you want control over what packages exist and what's in each package.  However, the names and descriptions should come across automatically.</p>

<p>I would hope that Simplifier would be capable of exporting to allow the use of templates - if not, they'll find themselves not useable for HL7 balloted content, IHE balloted content or that of anyone else who wants tight look-and-feel of their IGs.  After a while, that's going to take a good chunk out of their market...  (The look &amp; feel of evey type of template will evolve over time and I'm pretty sure HL7 is going to mandate consistent look &amp; feel across all our IGs - which means they're all going to have to publish using the same template.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> We could have a 'testing' folder.  Disagree about not needing several igpublisher.jars.  You may well find that you want to publish some IGs with one version of the publisher and others with a different one for some reason.

<p>As a side note - every time I've had to use markdown, I've had to embed a bunch of funky markdown escapes and commands to make it work right, which to me means that it's not significantly less complicated to learn than XHTML, with the downside that there's no schema or built-in validation when authoring,  and worse, the markdown we author the pages in is different the markdown we author the attribute descriptions in, so it doesn't work exactly the same.</p>

<p>I'm not suggesting the people will have to register their resources - if they want all of them, they'll get all by default.  But if they <em>don't</em> want all of them, they'll have the option of registering them to choose what they want and/or to choose what packages they'll appear in.</p>

<p>I.e. if your IG doesn't list any resources, the build will look to find all the candidates and group them in packages based on criteria we decide and will publish all of them.  If your IG does list resources, we'll use the packages you define and include the resources you reference and nothing else.</p>

<p>In terms of output, I don't understand there being any changes to bookmarks - unless you bookmark your local output?  All the documentation is changing anyhow, so don't much care about that.  In the tooling, it <em>should</em> just be a change of a constant in the publisher and in the CI build process.

<p>I would hope that Simplifier would be capable of exporting to allow the use of templates - if not, they'll find themselves not useable for HL7 balloted content, IHE balloted content or that of anyone else who wants tight look-and-feel of their IGs.  After a while, that's going to take a good chunk out of their market...  (The look &amp; feel of evey type of template will evolve over time and I'm pretty sure HL7 is going to mandate consistent look &amp; feel across all our IGs - which means they're all going to have to publish using the same template.)</p>

<p>that's an ongoing discussion we should continue at Montreal. The template is 2 things - a publishing convenience and a fixed look and feel for the IGs. The first part is not important for Simplifier. The second part will be required for anything published through HL7, but meeting that look and feel won't necessarily require actually using the template</p>

<p>Just inserting myself into the conversation to note that we publish IGs at MITRE using our CIMPL tooling -- and I'm all for simplification of publishing via easier to use templates.  We already make it as simple as possible for our users, but that just makes our own code a bit more complicated -- and speaking from experience, it did take me a while to get that all working correctly.  So if we can lower the barrier for others, I think that would be a good thing.  And I'll gladly replace my code with a better and easier template. ;-)</p>

<p>I have to digest what Lloyd outlined above before I can chime in here.    I  think that the fixed look and feel that GG mentions is important but equally important  is on making it easier publish without being an expert in html, jekyll, liquid , json or xml, or (your  programming language here).  Still too may knobs and switches and we need start limiting the options.</p>

<p>So long as the default options are easy, I'm not sure we need to limit things too much.  We can't stop people from authoring instances in the syntax they're most comfortable with, so XML or JSON will always be there - though I'm hoping we can find a way to let them embed references to examples in their text so that they don't have to mess around with escaping unvalidatable JSON or XML inline.  Similarly, we can't avoid the need for some level of liquid tags to get the directories right.  But hopefully we can limit the need to know too much more.</p>

<p>OK so I finally tried your ig pub framework and I struggled to convert my test ig over to it.  It requires the manual  creation of an Implementation guide resource.  I don't think that is an author friendly approach.    I think the Implementation guide resource input needs to be  a UI form or excel driven. ( I  generated the ig.json and ig.xml from a csv and slurp up the fhir artifacts from the folders)</p>
<p>We are in agreement the file tree needs to be fixed and prescribed, I think it should evolve so it drives the ig menu and page structure.  (Which I think will make GG unhappy)    I.e it should align with Jekyll. ( but need watch out for messing up the includes)<br>
I think the layouts ( layouts ~= templates ) are the easiest thing about this.  Pretty straight forward obviously is a matter of taste and Obvously I like mine better  :-) ...but once we decide on layouts they hopefully can be ordered up like a menu item.   As far as authoring in md or html that should be slurped up from the folder/ file name so its in the background. ( same with the xml,json, xls for fhir artifacts), I wonder if Chris has done all of this already? </p>
<p>I'm pretty neutral on the ant thing.   I'm not clear why it needs to be part of the ig-pub.</p>

<p>Going forward, the ImplementationGuide resource is the bit that will <em>have</em> to be created.  There won't be any JSON files anymore.

<p>The UI for IG authoring is out of scope.  If you use a tool like Trifolia, it should take care of it for you.  If we want to come up with a way to author IGs using a spreadsheet, we can, though not sure how enthused Grahame will be about that.

<p>I think that authoring the ImplementationGuide, CapabilityStatement and Structuredefs are off putting for ig authors and hard without tooling.  External tooling already exists for SDs, and is needed for Capstatements, but I think ImplementationGuide tooling needs to be part and parcel to the ig pub process an a ui form/( or excel)  for ease of Authoring.   I do it before calling the ig-pub using bash.      I'm not sure why the ant script needs to be part of the the ig-pub.   I can see calling it multiple times in a single script but I don't really care either way.</p>
<p>To be precise the ImpGuide template is different template from the Jekyll layouts/templates. </p>
<p>I don't know why the file tree can't mimic the menu and TOC  and I don't  think external links should be menu items .   This is an example of limiting the options to make it simpler and more uniform.</p>

<p>I don't want simpler/more uniform that's less useful to the target audience.  The external links in CRD are quite important and having an easy way to get to them all the time is needed.

<p>No need for them to know anything about YAML.  They can pick one of markdown or XHTML (though knowing a bit of XHTML is useful even for the markdown folks as sometimes markdown won't do what you need).  For the resources you need to know XML or JSON but don't need the other.  Perhaps someday we'll have a tool suite that will protect authors from all that, though to be honest, I'm not sure how much I'd trust an IG that was written by someone who can't hand-edit an XML or JSON instance.  How can you write something targeting developers if you don't have some basic technical chops?</p>

<p>If we expect authors to be capabable of  providing IG artifacts  in completed form then why do we need 1,2,3?</p>
<p>I think we just hash how the look and feel of the templates?<br>
"<br>
Lloyd McKenzie: My proposal:<br>
1. You change the IGPublisher to support hitting an Ant build script with the target names we'd agreed on and be able to point at a "template" IGPackage - including the ability to merge the properties in the 'template' IG with those from the local IG files<br>
2. I adapt my framework which is already Ant-driven and is sort of organized based on those steps already to work with the IGPublisher and we iterate until it actually runs<br>
3. We adapt the template to accomodate capabilities that Eric's framework already has<br>
4. We open up the template for more general feedback around appearance and capabilities (likely around the WGM)<br>
Lloyd McKenzie: 5. We create a sample IG that explains gown to create an IG using the template<br>
6. We work to get Trifolia and Simplified to be able to publish using the template.<br>
7. We get John or someone to adapt the template for use with IHE. (And decide if we should have a more generic template that we and others can adapt from.)<br>
8. We get everyone to adjust their IGs to use the template prior to ballot.<br>
In #3 we should be checking that Forge profiling will work..( @Michel Rutten I presume there's no interest from Firely in support for pure Forge- authored IGS in step 6?)</p>
<p>At some point in there (probably 3 or 4) we also need to rejig the IG publisher and template to support multi- version IGs.<br>

<p>I would hope that Simplifier would be capable of exporting to allow the use of templates - if not, they'll find themselves not useable for HL7 balloted content, IHE balloted content or that of anyone else who wants tight look-and-feel of their IGs.  After a while, that's going to take a good chunk out of their market...  (The look &amp; feel of evey type of template will evolve over time and I'm pretty sure HL7 is going to mandate consistent look &amp; feel across all our IGs - which means they're all going to have to publish using the same template.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not so much about marketshare, but about keeping the FHIR tooling ecosystem aligned. Please keep in mind:<br>
- That we already have a WYSIWYG IG editor built in in Simplifier<br>
- That we have an agreement in place with HL7 that allows all users and authors of HL7 ballotable content to use the Enterprise account of HL7 on Simplifier. This includes numerous advanced features. Always happy to do a demo if you're interested<br>
- That we recognize the need for IG alignment and that we have a master template for HL7 ballotable content available on Simplifier<br>
- That we have regular meetings with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191808">@Wayne Kubick</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  around the HL7 and Firely tooling for the purpose of alignment.</p>
<p>We recommend a clear separation between the spec and the IG guidelines on the one hand, and the tooling on the other hand.</p>
