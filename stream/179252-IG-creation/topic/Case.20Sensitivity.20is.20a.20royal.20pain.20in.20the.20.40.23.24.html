<p>I spent the last hour debugging  which stems from case sensitive autobuild ( thank you LINUX  :sarcasm:) and most of using case insensitive local machine ( thank you OS and Windows ! ). This is a pain to constantly debug only made worse by the fact that GitHub which does not change the case for a file name (which I keep forgetting) when you change it locally.  So can we just make everything case insensitive in the publisher to stop wasting all this time?</p>
<p>for example  I'm going to make a couple of template tweaks to make the file naming for type in pages <em>-intro and -notes</em> case insensitive so ValueSet.md and valueset.md and valueSet*.md are treated the same. Does anybody have any issues with that?</p>
<p>here is an example of what I mean:</p>
<p>here is a pagecontent directory:</p>
<p>├── OperationDefinition-example-notes.md<br>
├── StructureDefinition-extension-blah-intro.md<br>
├── StructureDefinition-extension-complex-intro.md<br>
├──etc</p>
<p>which Would be equivalent to:</p>
<p>├── operationdefinition-example-notes.md<br>
├── structureDefinition-extension-blah-intro.md<br>
├── STRUCTUREDEFINITION-extension-complex-intro.md<br>
├──etc</p>
<p>Right now the second won't be rendered...</p>

<p>right now the IG publisher enforces case sensitivity where ever it can.  Obviously you found somewhere that I missed. I do that because on OSs where there is case sensitivity, I can't always override that (and it's painful even where I can)</p>
