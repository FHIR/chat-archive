I followed the instructions in the warning, created a PR, and it was merged.  <br>
However, during that process, I noted some things were in the jira-current that weren't in the jira-new file (like versions and specification attributes) and manually added those before the merge (I actually had to add the versions in order to merge).  But now the publisher continues to generate the jira-new without those things so there's a mismatch with jira-current and the Warning remains in qa.html</p>
<p>I can't figure out how to get the publisher to generate those additional items (ciUrl, defaultVersion, defaultWorkgroup, and the versions):<br>

<p>Everything else in the two files is synchronized... how do I get these last few items to sync?</p>

<p>Also, the deprecated versions stick around somehow (but only the deprecated versions).  No idea how.</p>

<p>The versions come from your package-list.json.  If you have versions in your Jira file that aren't in the generated Jira, that means they're missing from your package-list.json (and should be added).  Deprecated versions are carried forward and aren't expected to be in the package-list.json (though they can be).</p>

<p>I originally thought the versions should be coming from the package-list.json, but they're in package-list.json and not in the generated Jira so I thought that must not be the case: <a href="/user_uploads/10155/yQQ9nOOGsQ2w229L3bXiGvhl/package-list.json">package-list.json</a>.  (guess I should have stuck with that original thought  <span aria-label="grinning" class="emoji emoji-1f600" role="img" title="grinning">:grinning:</span>  thanks for clarifying! )</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> Given the package-list.json I posted above (which includes the versions) any thoughts on why versions are in my Jira file but missing in the generated Jira?  (or really, why they're in my package-list.json [which matches my Jira file] but missing in the generated Jira)</p>

<p>Also, thoughts on the missing attributes in the specification element and how to resolve those?</p>
