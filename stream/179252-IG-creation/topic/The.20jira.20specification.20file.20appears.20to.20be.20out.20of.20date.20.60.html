<p>This warning started to appear this morning. Any advice what it means and how to fix it? <br>
<code>The jira specification file appears to be out of date with the versions, artifacts and pages currently defined in the IG. A proposed revised file to be reviewed and, if appropriate, submitted as a pull request against the XML folder in https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts.</code></p>

<p>It means you're using the current template and that there are resources and pages in your IG that aren't listed in the Jira spec file.  Information on how to change that is here: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Configuring+Specification+Feedback" title="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Configuring+Specification+Feedback">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Configuring+Specification+Feedback</a></p>
