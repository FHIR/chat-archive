<p>I'm starting to work on wrapping up the ExampleScenario editor and IG editor (is any of these more urgent?).  I would appreciate input on functionality:</p>

<p>(sorry if this is wrong thread, not sure I should put it here or tooling)<br>
For the IG editor, I have a "template" that separates the "content" folder from the "publisher" folder - this allows me to work on 5 IGs  without having 5 times the IG Publisher. That works well, and now I want to see how an editor would get the entire content of my IG - the pages, the images, the resources,... everything they need to get working.</p>
<p>What would be the best .?<br>
1- get a package that contains the entire "content" folder and work from there?<br>
2- pull the folder from git/svn/...<br>
3- anything else like just downloading a zip?...</p>
<p>I started with option 3 just to get it working, then I learned that we will need git anyway, and now that I am trying to make it consistent for the user, I am thinking perhaps 1 + 2 are better...</p>

<p>I currently already do this with one project.  Your ImplementationGuide  points to the specific resources and pages it wants.  It's perfectly possible for IGs to share content, though in general that's a bad idea for resources - those should generally only exist in a single IG.</p>

<p>Where we currently have a challenge is that the integration with the CI build environment requires there to be only one IG for a given IG project.  We might be able to find a work-around for that though.</p>
