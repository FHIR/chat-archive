<p>I've just released IG publisher 1.0.98. Last time we got to .99, we did a major release - the 99 makes us think, see. There might be a 1.0.99, or not, but I'm planning to call the next one the first in the 1.1.x series. There'll be several changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>there's going to be a new release process (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="248736">@Mark Iantorno</span> is working on that now). </li>
<li>The binaries will move again - we're planning to use the github release system from now on</li>
<li>The major change of significance is that I'll no longer be accepting bug reports and feature requests etc informally on this stream. It's still fine - preferred - to discuss them here, and characterise the issue, but I'll be asking any outcomes to be reported as issues (with or without PRs) on <a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher">https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher</a></li>
<li>I'll be tracking prioritization of issues based on reactions ( <span aria-label="+1" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="+1">:+1:</span> for change, <span aria-label="-1" class="emoji emoji-1f44e" role="img" title="-1">:-1:</span> against change, <span aria-label="heart" class="emoji emoji-2764" role="img" title="heart">:heart:</span> to vote for priority)</li>

<p>I'm going to have to start cutting down the number of hours I spend on the IG publisher, and increasing participation from Mark too, so we need to invest more in process. About 40% of my time on this is spent characterising and recreating issues - we'll be looking for more well defined issues e.g. get this branch of this IG, build it, and look in this file at line X (or equivalent)</p>

<p>and I'm considering that the slate is presently clean. I have no back log of issues that aren't fixed or registered on github. If you have any open issues, assume that I've missed them and raise them again</p>

<p>Schemas are still broken on core - though that's not a publisher issue</p>
