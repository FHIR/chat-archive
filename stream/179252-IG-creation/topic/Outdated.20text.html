<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  This profile: <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/case-reporting/branches/master/StructureDefinition-pregnancy-status-observation.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/case-reporting/branches/master/StructureDefinition-pregnancy-status-observation.html">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/case-reporting/branches/master/StructureDefinition-pregnancy-status-observation.html</a> seems to have cached some text that has since been changed  - see bolded text at the end of the description right before "Formal Views of Profile Content": "TODO - update this to suit use case for just eCR". That was in the description but I've removed it in the past few hours (like probably 6 hours ago). (The whole description has been udpated, but that is the easiest difference to see).</p>
<p>Not sure why it's still there - if you take a look at the StructureDefinition for the resource and do a search for "TODO" it definitely isn't anywhere.

<p>Never mind! This was my issue...</p>
