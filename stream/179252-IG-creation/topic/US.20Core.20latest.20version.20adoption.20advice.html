<p>Looking for some advice. For several of the IGs I'm working on we have been planning on moving the dependency on US Core to the latest version once it gets published. </p>
<p>US Core has removed Must Support constraints on several elements on US Core Patient (birthSex, race, ethnicity, telecom, etc. see: <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.html">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.html</a>.) These are elements in USCDI and the US Core spec now has the following prose to take care of the USCDI component:</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/10155/0WxfxoLmd6omxtsMrMi953pQ/image.png">image.png</a> </p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/10155/0WxfxoLmd6omxtsMrMi953pQ/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/10155/0WxfxoLmd6omxtsMrMi953pQ/image.png"></a></div><p>For the IGs I'm working on, we need Must Support on most of the above mentioned data elements.</p>
<p>For all the IGs we have already created profiles that further constrain US Core anyway, so we will just have to add back in the Must Supports on to the elements where they were removed.</p>
<p>I'm trying to get a sense of whether folks think it's a good idea to move to the latest version, or should we stick with the previous version of US Core? Really I think I'm trying to get a sense of whether people can think of any reasons NOT to use the latest version... (I vacillate hourly between sticking with the current version and using the latest!)</p>

<p>I think you should stick to the latest</p>
