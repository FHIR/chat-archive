<p>Hi all, I started adding the 'formal' conformance resources (e.g., CapabilityStatement) to an IG and was wondering about an error.  Specifically, I'm trying to state conformance to the profile that's being published.  Since it hasn't been published yet, the URL doesn't resolve and throws errors in the build, e.g.:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>error: URL value &#39;http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/subscriptions-backport&#39; does not resolve
error: URL value &#39;http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/subscriptions-backport/OperationDefinition/backport-subscriptiontopic-list&#39; does not resolve
</code></pre></div>
<p>Are these considered an 'acceptable' errors (as they will disappear during publishing), or is there some way to indicate to publisher that those are local?</p>
