<p>I get the following error building the IG using Lloyd's framework approach. It does not seem to effect the build but something must be wrong. The error is</p>
<p>Error in snapshot generation:  valueQuantity has an element that is not marked with a snapshot match</p>
<p>Does anyone understand what this error means and how to fi it?</p>

<p>It means that your hierarchy isn't complete in the differential.  Every element in the differential needs to have all ancestors present - though you don't have to say anything about them.</p>

I do have the Device as the baseDefinition (its only the property giving me trouble)</p>
<p>My first element for the property differential is</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>    &lt;!-- PROPERTY: This element is going to be sliced for time capabilities, clock resolution, time synchronization,
    synchronization accuracy, PAN certification lists, and regulations status. There can be many property elements
    for PHDs. --&gt;
    &lt;element id=&quot;Device.property&quot;&gt;
      &lt;path value=&quot;Device.property&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;slicing&gt;
        &lt;!-- The type.system and the type of value (code or quantity) are needed to distinguish entrants. The BITs properties
        (time capabilities and regulation status) will have a fixed system ASN1-url with a coded value. The remaining entrants
        will have the same fixed 10101-url with either a single-coded, multiple-coded, or quantity entry. --&gt;
        &lt;discriminator&gt;
          &lt;type value=&quot;value&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;path value=&quot;type.coding.system&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/discriminator&gt;
        &lt;discriminator&gt;
          &lt;type value=&quot;type&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;path value=&quot;$this&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/discriminator&gt;
        &lt;rules value=&quot;open&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/slicing&gt;
      &lt;!-- There will, at minimum be a MDC_TIME_SYNC_PROTOCOL entry --&gt;
      &lt;min value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/element&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>which seems okay. The slices are defined after.</p>

<p>I have the answer. There is a typo in the spec on the Device.property.valueQuanity. I was spelling it correctly Device.property.valueQuantity. Note the missing 't'. I ran into the same problem in HAPI FHIR which took me hours to solve! I have already submitted a change request for it during the HL7 meeting last week.</p>
