<p>I had made a pull request to update the JIRA-Spec-Artifacts to include the new version for the 2020Sept ballot, but I am now getting a warning: "The jira specification file appears to be out of date with the versions, artifacts and pages currently defined in the IG. A proposed revised file to be reviewed and, if appropriate, submitted as a pull request against the XML folder in <a href="https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts">https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts</a>. To see the differences, perform a file compare on 'template/jiraspec.tmp.xml' (currently in Github) and 'jira.xml' (reflects current IG content)". The CI Build for the ballot is a branch, since the main branch is ready for publication but not yet officially published. I tried to revert the change made to the jira spec repo but it didn't let me remove a version. I don't believe a Jira issue has been created to link to this new ballot version. How should this warning be resolved?@<strong>Grahame Grieve</strong> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span></p>

<p>You would want Jira to cover all of the artifacts and pages in the ballot.  So you should make a pull request that reflects your ballot.  If this results in some differences from your 'official' release (because new artifacts have been added or some have been deprecated), just note that in your publication submission.  So long as the differences are known and understood and driven by the new release, you can ignore the message in your final publication submission.</p>

<p>Thanks Lloyd. I had noted it in the publication request for the ballot.</p>

<p>Hello <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192119">@Yan Heras</span> ,</p>
<p>I am seeing the warning you were seeing in August. Could you please tell me how you resolved it? </p>
<p>"The jira specification file appears to be out of date with the versions, artifacts and pages currently defined in the IG. A proposed revised file to be reviewed and, if appropriate, submitted as a pull request against the XML folder in <a href="https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts">https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts</a>. To see the differences, perform a file compare on 'template/jiraspec.tmp.xml' (currently in Github) and 'jira.xml' (reflects current IG content)"</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Larry</p>

<p>There should be a file named the same as the one in JIRA-Spec-Artifacts for your particular IG generated into your root IG folder.  (E.g. for CRD, the file is FHIR-us-davinci-crd.xml).  The warning is saying that there's a difference between the two files - likely because of a discrepancy in artifacts, pages or versions.  In most cases, you should update the file in JIRA-Spec-Artifacts to reflect what's in the generated file - because the generated file is based on what's currently in your IG, though you can choose to make changes to it.</p>

<p>Sometimes you HAVE to make changes, since there will be conflicts in the 'name' assigned to the artifact.  For example, if you have codesystems/valuesets with the same names (I don't like to do this, but my coauthors sometimes insist).   If you run the build process in the JIRA-Spec-Artifacts repo, it will flag all of these issues for you and you can fight through them.</p>
<p>Once you get a clean build, submit a pull request against JIRA-Spec-Artifacts, and send Lloyd a coupon for a beer, and all will be well.</p>
