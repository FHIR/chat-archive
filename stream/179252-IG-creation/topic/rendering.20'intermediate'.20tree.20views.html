<p>If create profile 'Foo' based on a US-Core Profile would it be possible to create fragments to show the combined differential tree view of <em>Foo + USCore</em> in addition to the Foo differential and Snapshot?  Here is an example wher e that would be helpful... <a href="https://argonautproject.github.io/clinicalnotes/StructureDefinition-example-dr.html#sd-1-1formal-views-of-profile-content" target="_blank" title="https://argonautproject.github.io/clinicalnotes/StructureDefinition-example-dr.html#sd-1-1formal-views-of-profile-content">https://argonautproject.github.io/clinicalnotes/StructureDefinition-example-dr.html#sd-1-1formal-views-of-profile-content</a></p>

<p>by possible I really mean would it be really challenging and painful to do this.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, you would like to merge the differential constraints from separate layered profiles, e.g. combine diff constraints from base profile with diff constraints from derived profile?<br>
Maybe you can use a trick. Suppose profile C constrains profile B, and profile B constraints profile A.<br>
1) Generate snapshot component for the profile C, derived from profile B<br>
2) Replace the original differential component with the generated snapshot<br>
3) Hack the StructureDefinition.base, change from B url to A url<br>
4) Re-open the hacked profile in Forge<br>
5) Forge will now recalculate the diff with respect to the new base (A)<br>
6) In effect, the re-generated diff now contains all merged constraints from profile B &amp; C with respect to profile A.<br>
Not sure this works, but I think Simone Heckman has also discovered (and used) this hack a while ago.</p>

<p>Yes that is an option  (essentially manually constructing the intermediate diff) .  Its an extra step in publishing two two profiles to show a step wise transition in a single view.    thanks for the tip</p>

<p>I'm not sure the IGPublisher has the cyode to calculate the diff - which would be a pre-requisite to doing something like this.  Agree it would be a nice feature, but given how huge a pain calculating snapshots is, not likely something I see happening without sponsorship by a project that wants to pay for it (and even then we'd think twice given the maintenance effort - though hopefully that'll be less once StructureDefinition is normative.</p>

<p>I updated the sd.html template for an optional second differential to display.  like Michel described above you have to have to create the fragment with a second profile and manually add the fragment into an autogenerated include file.  Its a total  hack and don't know if its worth it. <a href="/user_uploads/10155/5I2f7u18IqjVNo-63qhKA9iK/Screen-Shot-2018-04-19-at-1.41.53-PM.png" target="_blank" title="Screen-Shot-2018-04-19-at-1.41.53-PM.png">Screen-Shot-2018-04-19-at-1.41.53-PM.png</a></p>
