<p>The FHIR publication toolbox (Publisher + templates) have a range of features that could be better documented - by means of examples or something else.<br>
To start catching up with documentation, what would be the top priorities? What are the features that we are most interested in seeing documented / have examples? Can we discuss here or in <a href="https://github.com/HL7/ig-template-base/issues">https://github.com/HL7/ig-template-base/issues</a>? Would be good to prioritize after having some sense of what is most useful.<br>
(I guess a valid thing to document is "the list of features that the IG Publisher supports" - we'll get to it.) <br>
Anything that we remember in particular going through and wish there were documentation?</p>
