<p>Da Vinci was having a discussion this morning that, in part, comes down to a tooling/methodology challenge.  US-Core has a specific version that's referenced in regulation.  However, newer versions can be authorized for use and, from time to time, the 'minimum' version gets moved up.  Da Vinci puts out IGs that depend on US-Core.  Ideally what we want to do is put out <em>one</em> release of each IG and allow validation against the <em>range</em> of US-Core IG versions that are 'allowed'.  E.g. it should be possible to validate against CDex version A and US-Core version B.1, B.2 or B.3.  This is technically gnarly.  Any thoughts on if/how this could be done without putting out a separate CDex release for each possible US-Core release?</p>

<p>extend the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/NPM+Package+Specification">version references</a> to include also minor versions (patch are supported with a .x notation)?</p>

<p>none of the tools support anything but a single reference. And I have no idea how I could either</p>

<p>though that answer is correct in principle</p>

<p>NPM supports dependency version references like &gt;4.1.0 if I recall correctly. Perhaps we could bring that into our  package spec?<br>
(I think this ties in with my <a href="#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/IG.20fhirVersion/near/267306127">version question</a> of how an IG or profile says it's valid against any R4 release.)</p>

<p>Validation has to happen against specific versions.  I'm not only talking about 'minor' version changes.  In principle, regulations could authorize the use of versions where there are breaking changes.  Maybe the only solution is a "please generate 3 copies of this IG, with the following dependency differences" and then have the different IG variations point to each other.</p>
