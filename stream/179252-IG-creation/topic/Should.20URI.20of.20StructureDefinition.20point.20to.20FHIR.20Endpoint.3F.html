<p>When I want to deploy multiple IGs into one FHIR server I see following challenges:<br>
-   How to avoid Id collisions between the profiles of different IGs?<br>
-   Should the URI of a StructureDefinition resource point to a valid FHIR endpoint?<br>
How should the URL look in this scenario?<br>
Would you recommend: <br>
A) <a href="http://myCompany.org/fhir/IG-A/StructureDefinition/Profile1">http://myCompany.org/fhir/IG-A/StructureDefinition/Profile1</a> <br>
or <br>
B) <a href="http://myCompany.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Profile1-">http://myCompany.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Profile1-</a> IG-A<br>
The advantage of A) is, that I have more freedom regarding the profile names. <br>
Disadvantages of A) are risk of ID collisions and the URL can't be resolved in a FHIR server<br>
So would you recommend to build URLs as described in B)?</p>

<li>There's no expectation that the id of a resource will be unique across all IGs.  What matters is that the URL is unique across all IGs.  The id of a resource will typically vary as it moves from server to server.</li>
<li>There's no specific rule, but given that content in different IGs is typically managed separately, treating the IG as the namespace is safest.  HL7 international uses approach A for its IGs - and sets up redirects so that canonical URLs redirect to the appropriate hosted pages.</li>
