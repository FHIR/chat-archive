<p>Does anyone have experience using FMM levels for IG resources; for example labelling one profile as FMM0 while another profile is FMM2? Can organizations other than HL7 use FMM levels (since the definition of the levels speak about WGs, etc.)?</p>

<p>That's on the near-term list of things to add to the templates.  (Also standards status.) I've been struggling about whether to support it in the 'base' template or only the HL7 template.  FMM refers to specific expectations around 'ballot', which wouldn't be relevant to non-HL7 artifacts.  However, perhaps FMG could soften that to 'formal review', noting that in HL7, that formal review is expected to be balloting.  You could submit a request to the FMG to suggest that.</p>

<p>I think any solution would have to allow organizations to define their own maturity levels, which could involve balloting, formal review, or just publication. What I'd like to see in the base template is standard content that appears if a maturity level is defined for a resource. "This profile/valueset/etc. is at MyOrg maturity level: PG-13. To know more about MyOrg maturity levels, please see link"</p>

<p>Perhaps a base property that says "maturity definitions".  If the IG has such a property, we'll expose.  Though I'm concerned that the extension we drive off of has a fixed value set, which might make it harder to find other types of maturities</p>

<p>Because the extension was defined for HL7 without other uses in mind.  At minimum, I think we'd have a preferred binding.  Trick if we loosen it how do we enforce that HL7 artifacts only have the HL7 maturities and don't allow any others</p>

<p>I am very much wanting to expose in the IG I author the underlying FMM of the resources I profile. We do this manually in IHE today, would be great if it could be automated. Today it shows up as a IG wide table of Resource | FMM</p>

<p>What I'm thinking of now is that there'd be two parameters in the IG - one would be the URL where maturity levels are defined and the second would be the canonical URL of the extension that conveys maturity on artifacts.  The publisher would 'propagate' that extension from high-level resources down into resources that don't have declared maturities and would expose those maturities in the resource summary table with a hyperlink to the place that defines them.  If an IG doesn't define either property, no maturities shown.  If it defines one but not the other, that's an error.  (I'm also thinking we'll put an extension on the maturity extension that conveys where an inferred maturity came from and could show a flag indicating that a maturity had been inferred and a fly-over showing from where (would probably only show the first 5 artifacts or so whose maturity drove that level declaration).  I think we'd require that maturities have a numeric scale - because otherwise there'd be no way to know how to propagate the 'highest' maturity.</p>

<p>Sorry, I'm having a hard time understanding this. I get a "URL where maturity levels are defined" (although, I am kinda drawn to using a codesystem for this, which makes it easy to validate), but I get lost after that. You're proposing an extension that identifies another extension?</p>
<p>Are you also picturing something that enforces a profile on an FMM 2 resource can't have a profile maturity of more than 2? I can't see that working unless we align the definitions. What happens if my IG uses a 3-level maturity model, or a 12-level model? How do those map to FMM2? Maybe one org's levels match 1:1 for FMM levels 0-4, but have 3 more levels before the FMM level 5; another org may have 3 levels between 0 and 1, but 2-5 match the FMM. Even if definitions are aligned, why shouldn't an org say this is a finalized (balloted, published, normative, etc.) IG (and thus the profiles in it are highest maturity) based on FHIR STU3 (which has no normative content).</p>

<p>OK, this is where I get confused. You want maturities on a linear scale, so you can inherit base resource maturities and cap current resource maturity based on base resource maturity? If my profile's base has a FMM of 2, does that mean my resource (which I would put as a 17--predraft status--on my maturity scale) gets capped at 2?</p>

<p>My other issue is why the need for fmm-extension? Why have an element that lets you select an extension, instead of everyone agreeing on one extension, but leaving the valueset open?</p>
<p>If you do need it, unless it is specifically for conveying FMM, leave FMM out of the name. Use maturity-extension.</p>

<p>I don't want to inherit base resource maturities.  The driver for numbers is so that if you have a value set with no maturity and it's used by an extension with maturity 6 and a profile with maturity 8, we can infer a maturity of 8 for the value set.</p>

<p>Maturity of a resource would never be inherited to determine the maturity of a profile.  (Though in HL7, there would be a warning if a profile declares that it's more mature than the underlying resource.)</p>

<p>Not sure how we're making things more difficult.  You can define the extension you want to use with the semantics and scale you want it to have and it should just work.  If everyone uses the <em>same</em> extension, then we'd have to make it a Coding rather than a code or integer, which bulks things up a bit.  Not understanding how a generic extension with Coding makes things easier?</p>

<p>The extensions for capturing standards status and resource maturity will be the same ones as are used in the core spec.  They will propagate, so for example, if the IG is set to "STU" and "FMM 3", then everything else in the IG will be too.  If two resources would be propagated to by the same source - e.g. a value set is used by two profiles, one STU and one draft, the higher one will be inherited.  Examples are always 'informative' and have no FMM.</p>

<p>The changes are mostly made, but Grahame wanted me to refactor a few things and I've needed to turn my attention to getting SDC changes finalized.  I hope to return to FMM shortly after the WGM.

<p>OK, I'll play around with that a bit. The propagation isn't present yet, correct?</p>
<p>Somewhat related, if I'm profiling a resource that has an element with an example valueset, and I provide that element with another valueset (maybe with a stricter binding), is there a way to show that binding is draft/trial-use/experimental? The rest of the profiling is solid, and the valueset we've chosen is solid too, but we want feedback on whether that was the right valueset to choose. As far as I can tell, I can't apply the standards-status extension to the element, since it isn't (e.g.) TU in the base resource, and I can't indicate that the binding is trial, so I"m left with setting the whole profile as trial. Now, setting the profile as trial makes sense because that reflects that not all of the profile is ready to go normative, but the flip side is that there is no way to point attention to the elements that are less mature in the profiling, except use of a note/ballot note in the intro. Is that all accurate?</p>

<p>You can show an element overall as being STU or draft, but you can't show a specific constraint as being STU or draft.  We haven't talked about what it means for a profile element to be STU when the base resource is normative, but given that the entire profile can be STU, it seems that a single element should be able to be - and similarly, you could have a draft element in an STU profile based on an STU resource.</p>

<p>I'm looking at adding maturity levels to mCODE IG. Reading the above discussion about using the HL7 FMM and alternative maturity models, my vote would be to change the FMM extension to a CodeableConcept. That allows the user to specify the system that defines the code. The codes then could be ordinal.  I think that is the proper approach.</p>

<p>One more thing about this:  I see the fmm extension being used on StructureDefinition, but the context of the fmm extension is "Element".  Are you supposed to use this as a top-level extension to express a profile's maturity, or are you supposed to add it to element[0]?</p>

<p>You can add maturity to any conformance resource that isn't an example.  (You can add to examples too, but it'll be ignored.)  Once the process for IGs turns on, maturity will cascade from IG to profiles to valuesets, code systems and extensions.  So you really only need to declare it where you want to override what'd be inherited.</p>
