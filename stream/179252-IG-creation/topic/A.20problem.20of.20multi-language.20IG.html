<p>Hi, <br>
Sorry that I re-post my question from <a class="stream" data-stream-id="215610" href="/#narrow/stream/215610-shorthand">#shorthand</a> (<a href="#narrow/stream/215610-shorthand/topic/A.20problem.20of.20multi-language.20IG">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/215610-shorthand/topic/A.20problem.20of.20multi-language.20IG</a>)  to here. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191469">@Chris Moesel</span>  thanks for your suggestion!</p>
<p>I have a question that we build IG in two versions, one is in English and the other is in Traditional Chinese.<br>
However, I found that Profile's "differential table" in our Chinese version will not be displayed the same as in the English version. I guess the reason is that we have translated the default description &amp; constraints from English to Chinese. So, the "_genonce.bat" or "publisher.jar" thinks we have modified the default values (even though we only do the translation without redefining cardinality, etc.) and put those translated elements in the differential table. as shown below.</p>

Thank you!</p>

<p>If there is content in the differential section of your spec, it will show up in the differential rendering - even if the only change is the definitions or usage notes.   What you might consider is two layers of profiling.  The first would merely translate the set of elements you care to bother translating - but not perform any constraining.  The second would be based on the first and impose your constraints.  The differential in your second profile would thus only show the changes and the snapshot would show everything - including the Chinese translations for all element you bothered to translate.  This would also have the benefit that the "translated" profile could be used as a base for a variety of constraint profiles.  Obviously if you wanted to refine the definitions or usage notes in any of the constrained profiles, you could do that.</p>
<p>There <em>may</em> actually be a mechanism to leverage the Chinese translations that have been made to the base specification (i.e. here: <a href="https://github.com/wanghaisheng/fhir-cn/blob/source/README.md">https://github.com/wanghaisheng/fhir-cn/blob/source/README.md</a>).  However, I'm not sure if we have the machinery in place to support that yet.  (If not, it's definitely on our 'list of things to do when we have bandwidth'...)  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> may have more information/ideas.</p>

<p>multi-language IGs are on the todo list. There needs to be better infrastructure for this, since the approach you're trying - pretty much the only one you have - won't really work</p>

<p>Okay. Thanks for your explanation and help. I am looking forward to a better infrastructure for multi-language IGs. Also, the current tools are already easy to use in designing and publishing IGs. <br>
