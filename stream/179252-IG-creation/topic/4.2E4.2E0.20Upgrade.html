<p>I've just upgraded to the IG publisher to use 4.4.0 internally, instead of 4.2.0. I've run all the tests etc, and everything looks good to me. Unless you are writing an R5 implementation guide, you won't be affected. </p>
<p>If you are writing an R5 implementation guide, and you're using ConceptMap, it's possible that you could get bitten by the changes to the relationship code system that Vocab have made. You should already have encountered them, but I found places where the change hadn't bit yet. Not sure why. Anyway, as far as I can tell, everything in R5 is consistent now.</p>
