<p>We're looking for your comments and feedback to help improve the processes for developing FHIR IGs that meet the quality criteria established by the FHIR Management Group (FMG). </p>
<p>The current requirements are documented in the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Implementation+Guide+Process+Flow">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Implementation+Guide+Process+Flow</a> - specifically <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=91980677">https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=91980677</a> and <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/F+-+Submission+for+Ballot+or+Publication">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/F+-+Submission+for+Ballot+or+Publication</a>. Leading up to a ballot, you receive reminder emails with upcoming dates, current status of the QA.html report and other requirements needed for your IG to go to ballot.</p>
<p>We would like your feedback on what is working, what doesn't work, what other mechanisms can be put in place to help.  You can provide your comments on the following Confluence Page:  <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Implementation+Guide+Quality+Process+Improvements">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Implementation+Guide+Quality+Process+Improvements</a></p>
