<p>Do I have to write my pages in html or can I use markdown? I am somewhat confused by the 'page.generation' element in the ImplementationGuide resource. Can I have my page url point to a markdown file (I am assuming this is a URL to the source) and have generation set to html?</p>

<p>page.generation indicates what the source format is - it can be markdown or html.  The generated content will of course always be html.</p>

<p>Oh that is music to my ears!!! So I can create source pages in markdown and go from there. I just noted in an existing IG guide that there were a lot of what looks like source pages in html. Worse these pages had a lot of 'commands' (to Jekyll maybe?) like {% include header.html %} which I have no knowledge about.</p>

<p>The IGPublisher framework uses Jekyll which in turn uses liquid.  Differing IGPublishers vary in terms of how much of that content lives in the "framework" portion of the IG and how much actually finds its way into the source that IG authors have to work with.  (In my IGs, the only jekyll stuff you'll see is {{site.data.fhir.path}} to point to the path for the version of FHIR the IG depends on.  We're currently working on establishing a standard IG framework all HL7 publishers will be able to use.</p>

<p>I take it the IG Publisher requires that one enter all those 'commands'. Does that rule out markdown for the IG publisher? I do not know how I would tell Jekyll to use the FHIR header in a markdown document. (I take it several of those items are standardized to get a consistent look).</p>

<p>Jekyll is pretty good about mixed HTML and markdown content.  If you look at the davinci-crd spec, you'll see that all of the headings, footers, etc. are defined using XHTML, but the content is markdown (with a few bits of HTML thrown in where markdown wouldn't do the job - e.g. styled blockquotes)</p>

<p>my IGs are markdown whereever possible  ( even where its easier in html  :-P)  look at the source for davince-deqm</p>
