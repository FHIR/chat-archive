<p>What should I say in my downloads page for packages?</p>
<p>I had used the text below  this before for the validation and other artifacts that were generated.  I assume its all being replaced by the node.js package file.  I don't see anything named like the npm name I specified in the  ig.json in the ig output directory but I have a package.tgz in the output which I assume the package file.  I am unfamiliar with how this is all going to work so I need a little guidance as to what to write  for how and where to access the NPM package and what it is good for.</p>
<hr>
<p>The following package file contains all the value sets, profiles, extensions, list of pages and urls in the IG, etc defined as part of the this version of the Implementation Guides.:</p>

<p>the package contains the NPM inside it</p>

<p>otherwise your description is accurate. but you could also say that this is the standard package for tools to use</p>
