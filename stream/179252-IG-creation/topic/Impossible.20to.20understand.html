<p>that does look sensationally awful. My first question was, what does the differential look like, and I think that you did yourself a disservice by asking "Can you summarize the purpose of this profile" without showing the differential</p>

<p>we've kind of toyed with this idea on and off. I could certainly build support for something like this straight into the IG publisher - for me, it would be a text format like the one we defined for structure map (and I would argue it should be similar and consistent where they overlap).</p>

<p>but.... there's a problem, which is that if you look at real world profiles, taken from actual IGs, the documentation details make a mess of the simplicity of the format. It turns ugly. And I firmly believe that documentation is important. So I think it would be good to extend this with some real world documentation</p>

<p>but, let's take value sets.... the value set text format is going to collapse to some YAML variant of a value set. Nicola has long argued that we should use YAML for this. And why doesn't the same apply for StructureDefinitions? what higher level language could be defined that doesn't break down in the presence of messy documentation and real world mixed constraints from actual cases?</p>

<p>btw, with regard to the original, I had some specific questions I haven't had time to pursue yet. </p>
<ul>
<li>why are these component observations, not independent observations - is that a right design (or just  hack)</li>
<li>if they are not really components, then this comes back to: how to visualise graphs of observations (already an open issue for me)</li>
<li>if they aren't.... is it time to get to breaking up the reprsentation of a large profile into chunks to make it more manageable for consumers of the documentation?</li>

<p>one more comment. One proposed benefit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>• Provides meaningful differentials</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But my experience here looking at the IGs that we have: the more pre-processing before the differential, the less meaningful your differential (the IGs you guys produce through thins like CIMPL tend to jam all sorts of non-essential things into the differential), where as shallow design processes are more sparing. I don't see why introducing a new text representation would change that (though it depends how much this is about <em>language</em> as opposed to syntax)</p>

<p>is the proposal to use this natively and drive the publisher or it just a language to create these artifacts that will drive the publisher, and why  couldn't it be YAML ?  ( I'm on the YML bandwagon too since Python is all about indents :-) )</p>

<p>i would take it as a possible input to the publisher. certainly we have a running thread for a text format like this. The suggested format has some value add over a straight YAML format, but it's not clear to me that what will survive the iteration process will be a big deal difference</p>

<p>Agreed, Excel is a catastrophe  ;-)<br>
Now that we've agreed that, we can discuss the best form for FPL. One keenly important aspect, as the leader of multiple profiling projects, is that it must be readable and understandable for everyone across the FHIR community, not just the most technically skilled folks. The second thing is that is should be fast to build and revise. We went through literally 100's of revisions on the way to mCODE, and I'm convinced we never would have made it without very agile profiling tools.  <br>
Another place we agree is that we should use existing piece-parts. There's no sense inventing new things if existing things are meet the design criteria.<br>
On the "provides meaningful diffs" comment, what I was trying to say is that two versions of the FPL could be compared to each other,.meaningfully. Comparing FPL across versions reveals exactly what was changed in the profiles. I wasn't saying diff the resulting SDs. <br>
As far as the example profile that drove this conversation, I can't answer for it. It isn't mine. This discussion came about because I got frustrated trying to review it for the ballot, and couldn't make heads or tails of it.<br>
I'll defer comments on YAML or Structure Map for a later date.</p>

<p>Excel for IG authoring (and publication) is useful in several ways:<br>
- there are times when a columnar view of what you're editing (including the ability to quickly and arbitrarily filter the rows) is extremely helpful in the authoring process.<br>
- The excel column headings give you prompts for what needs to exist and a visual overview of what's going on that a text format doesn't<br>
- from a publication perspective, most people know how to use Excel and can easily use it to create filtered views, add notes, document mappings, etc.</p>

<p>I don't think we have agreed to anything  yet .  I think excel is an excellent UI and easier to manipulate than text file and familar and accessible by 90% of the population, but also agree is not good for collaboration and repos.     My biggest concern is that a  new text based language  that you have to learn will be a barrier to adoption.</p>

<p>I'm not arguing that Excel is a desirable <em>persistence</em> format - it's horrible for that.  Nor am I arguing that Excel should be the only or even preferred tool for authoring profiles, just that it should be available.  My personal desire is to have an ability to easily do a save-as/load from Excel such that the persistence layer can be regular XML/JSON (the same as all of our other editing tools)</p>

<p>The discussion isn't whether Excel should die. It will continue to live on because it has some usefulness to some users. The idea of FPL is to provide something very concise and readable that scales over large projects. I believe that FPL will be easy to learn, and turn out to be _one_ of the preferred ways to approach profiling. <br>
Our experience with CIMPL has been that we often run the CIMPL complier without running the IG publisher, because it checks all sorts of things about the syntactic and logical consistency of the specification, in a few seconds. Once the model is sound, we may run the IG publisher if we want to see how the final output will look. But often, we just keep going and building profiles without running the IG publisher.  I suggest these steps should be separate.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191447">@Mark Kramer</span> I agree these two steps should be separate - i.e., but regression testing is important, so I think most times I want to see the output for a particular FHIR profile (or set of profiles) and related extensions and value set,  without having to generate the entire IG. I think the fact that we have to drag the entire IG to see the output for a single profile is the reason why we don't run the IG publisher everytime; it's just too cumbersome. But I guess that's a different requirement entirely :)</p>

<p>One important issue for me is: what's the official format checked into our revision control systems including the FHIR core spec. Excel spreadsheets are <em>very</em> hard to read diffs on; are prone to merge conflicts; and require a fair degree of sophistication to parse. (Though I'll note that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="222054">@Gino Canessa</span> still often edits these in a text editor when making tweaks, rather than in the Excel GUI, which to me shows just how valuable an actual editor-friendly format would be.)</p>

<p>SD provides multiple ways to do the same thing (as evidenced in the recent thread about the best way to fix a code).  Ideally FPL will provide a single way to do each thing an author might need to do. So that's easier. I'd also like to see FPL simplify common patterns to make them easier (particularly common approaches to slicing).</p>
<p>I'd also question whether FPL really needs to support every possible thing SD can support.  I'd suggest we go through the top 10 or so IGs and take inventory of the SD features they use.  It will be a subset for sure.  That's what we optimize for.  And then, <em>if necessary</em>, we provide a way to drop into a mode that's nearly like editing SD itself -- because someone will probably say it's a no-go if we can't do <em>everything</em> SD does.  But 98% of people will never use that part.  After all, we're about interoperability -- so we should probably be <em>discouraging</em> people from doing the really wacky one-off stuff anyway.</p>

<p>In answer to your question Josh about "do spreadsheets support everything?" the answer is "mostly, but probably not entirely".  That's not so much from intention as that the spreadsheet tends to catch up to new features when people complain/need them.  If we're going to look at a new syntax, it should certainly at least support all of the weird stuff that people use now.</p>

<p>Everything that appears in an IG is because the use-case requires it.  No-one does "wacky" things for fun and entertainment.  They only figured out how to do (and often badgered tool-makers to support doing it) because business requirements demanded it.  "Discouraging" isn't necessary or appropriate.  The fact that it's hard/esoteric is discouragement enough.</p>

<p>Anyone who's going to express profiles in a custom language is, pretty much by definition, going to be a power user.  We're unlikely to get non-technical users to author in free-hand text using a custom language when there's no tools that support guiding or validating.  So that makes the user of "power features" of profiles even more likely.</p>

<p>I think we're in agreement on some of these things, Lloyd.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Right, that's actually the kind of discouragement I meant. Every weird edge case that an author struggles to make work in their IG is a weird edge case that every single implementing system will also have to struggle with to be conformant.  So  keep it hard to do one-off stuff so that people are darned sure they really <em>need</em> whatever it is before putting it into their spec.  </p>

<p>I'm not trying to suggest that non-technical authors will be writing IGs, but I would like for the bar to be lower than it is today -- and we will 100% want tools to support guiding and validating.  The good news is that products like VS Code, Atom, and JetBrains have great infrastructure for developing tools to support DSLs.</p>

<p>What I'm suggesting is that FPL is more likely to be used by techie folks.  The non-technically sophisticated users will migrate to Forge, Trifolia and other tools with more limited capabilities but nicer UIs that hand-hold and prevent users from doing anything that's not allowed.  So if we're introducing something like FPL, it should be aimed at the stuff the more sophisticated users will want to do.</p>

<p>I don't disagree that novice users will prefer the visual tools, and "techie folks" will prefer the FPL. It's productivity, maintainability, and transparency that drives FPL.</p>

<p>As one who represents someone between "non-technically sophisticated" and a "techie folk" (I use Lloyd's spreadsheets to create my IGs), I'd like a nice GUI to get started, and then be able to import those artifacts into a more powerful tool (but possibly less user  friendly ) for possibly tricky things. I'm not shy about hand-editing JSON or what ever FPL might become.</p>

<p>Developer tools in atom for this would nice.  Do they exist today? So I’ve never done profiling using either FPL or YML and it would be nice try each approach if we are committed to a change.</p>

<p>Just to clarify -- FPL doesn't yet exist :) But we are exploring what the DSL might look like. Inputs are very welcome. Any interest in a Birds of a Feather meeting on FHIR Profiling Language this week at HL7?</p>
