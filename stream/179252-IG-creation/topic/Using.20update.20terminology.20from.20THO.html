<p>We have an IG that needs a new code that was added to the latest version of a code system that was originally published in FHIR, but has been migrated to THO: <a href="https://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem-measure-scoring.html">https://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem-measure-scoring.html</a>. I can see that the code system is present in <a href="http://tx.fhir.org">tx.fhir.org</a>, but it is the original version published as part of the spec. I can also see that there is a terminology service option to the publisher, but it's documented as only working with <a href="http://tx.fhir.org">tx.fhir.org</a> right now. Is there a way to get the publisher to make use of the updated code systems in THO?</p>
