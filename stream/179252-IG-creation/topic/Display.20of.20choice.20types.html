<p>Question about display of choice types in Differential and Snapshot Table views; e.g., [1] (see performed[x])<br>
[1] <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/STU32/StructureDefinition-qicore-procedure.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/STU32/StructureDefinition-qicore-procedure.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/STU32/StructureDefinition-qicore-procedure.html</a><br>
[2] <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-qi-core/StructureDefinition-qicore-procedure.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-qi-core/StructureDefinition-qicore-procedure.html">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-qi-core/StructureDefinition-qicore-procedure.html</a><br>
[3] <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/procedure.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/procedure.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/procedure.html</a><br>
[4] <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/procedure.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/procedure.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/procedure.html</a><br>
Why are the choices (performedDateTime and performedPeriod) shown nested under performed[x] in [3] but not in <a href="http://neither%20differential%20or%20snapshot" target="_blank" title="http://neither%20differential%20or%20snapshot">1</a>?<br>
Why are the choices shown nested under performed[x] in [4] and snapshot table of [2], but are not shown in differential table of [2].</p>

<p>I would have thought that they would all be expanded</p>

<p>I can't speak to all the changes, but I suspect that some of them are due to when they were published, and more specifically, the version of the publisher that was used to produce the HTML.  At least, that's my hunch.  That doesn't explain the difference between snapshot and differential in [2], but perhaps that is because the differential does not actually include the types as something different?</p>

<p>I think it should be expanded whatever, and I think that all but [3] were recent enough that it's not a version thing</p>

<p>[2], [3], [4] were all generated in Oct/Nov ([3] and [4] due to the technical update).  [1], which is the one that most blatantly doesn't expand the choice, was generated back in April.  I thought maybe that was it, but perhaps not.</p>
