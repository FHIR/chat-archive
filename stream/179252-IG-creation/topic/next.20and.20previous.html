<p>I understand that there is aspirations of having automatic next and previous navigation in the IG publisher, but it is not there yet... SO, I figure I will hack it in the hard way into the bottom of my markdown files. Has anyone already done this, producing a nice way to show them, icons, or something? I would be happy to copy/paste rather than fuss over it myself.</p>

<p>I've done the easy 2/3 of the work in the profiles.  The tricky bit is making it work across pages in structure definitions, for example, when different IGs enable and disable different subsets of pages.  That requires some Java work in the publisher to expose the relevant information.  May get to it in March.</p>

<p>We can discuss it, but I think the intention is that it'll be part of the base pattern and will show up everywhere.  My intention is to make it unobtrusive though.  There are a lot of people who want it.  They like to page through the spec like it's a document.  There are some places where that doesn't make a ton of sense, but in all IGs there are places where it does.  What concerns do you have about it being introduced <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span>?</p>

<p>Every page in the IG exists in an ordered table of contents, so there is technically a next/prev for everything.  It will typically be more 'useful' when looking at the narrative pages than when looking at artifacts, but some people like to page through everything, and next/prev gives them a more efficient way to do that than continuously navigating to the ToC.</p>
<p>I agree that "poorly deployed" is problematic, no matter the function.  Are there any objections to a 'well-deployed' next/prev navigation mechanism?  (And opinions on what 'well-deployed' means?)</p>

<p>Format and design matter and in my opinion it is a weakness of our IGs as they try to emulate pdfs, word documents or books and poorly implemented navigation and things like the table of content ( vs site menus ) and section numbering conflate the 2.  This degrades the quality of the user experience.  The navigation should be clear enough from the menu and with IGs that have used nest and previous links in the past , it was the only way to expose pages that were otherwise hidden to the reader.  (unless you slogged through the table of contents)</p>

<p>I <strong>totally</strong> agree.  If next/prev are necessary to reasonably navigate your IG, then you've messed up the design of your IG.  (And we've published quite a few IGs where that's been a problem.)<br>
However: There is a style of IG reading where next/previous is useful - both when reviewing and when consuming - where there's an objective of trying to consume either the whole thing or a particular topic area.  And therefore, I think it's reasonable for the template to enable this.</p>
<p>I'd love your thoughts on any kind of automated metrics or detection mechanism we could use to identify IGs that are not navigable independent of next/prev.  I'm not sure how we can detect it right now outside manual review.</p>

<p>The interest for next/previous was not to emulate PDF.  And this is why I think support on pages should be targeted. To just go down the table-of-content is not what I want. I have a few narrative pages that each build upon the other. So I really only need next/previous on these kind of pages. I do not want next / previous on most pages, specifically none of the technical pages. The technical pages hang together through specific text in their narrative.  For this reason, i am okay with not having this automated. What I was looking for is some consistency to how each IG would present next/previous .<br>
I ended up with simply using links </p>

<p>Can we link this to the discussion around structuring the content of an IG (evtl with Composition)? I think that for some IGs that have  fixed, linear structure, we could enable this.</p>

<p><em>All</em> IGs have an intrinsic linear structure, because all IGs must have a table of contents that drives their section numbers.  I don't see why we wouldn't have this supported everywhere.  If someone wants to click 'next' when they're looking at a SearchParameter to see the next artifact in the spec (according to whatever organization scheme artifacts are arranged in the table of contents), that's a reasonable thing to support.  I don't understand why we'd ever want to prohibit next/previous from appearing on a page so long as we ensure it's not visually disruptive.</p>

<p>Derived templates can always override and remove stuff.  However, I'd like us to have a policy that for HL7-published IGs, such overrides aren't allowed.  I.e. look and feel needs to be consistent across all the HL7 IGs.  IGs published by other organizations can take our base templates and override to their hearts' content, or start from scratch designing their own.</p>

<p>that is what I mean with completely different templates. All of them are based on the base template, but outside of the HL7 stack of templates, the others are "different" - because they can do whatever they want.</p>

<p>I used this example to show how I'd like the next and previous to tie into the a right sided floating menu.   I am less concerned with the themes than this functionality.</p>

<p>At this point I don't think changing the theme is useful as we have an established a look and feel for better or worse, but moving to a sidebar menu would be an incremental improvement and make the next/previous more intuitive</p>

<p>and I just noticed the examples coarse language now... that was not intentional.....(did not even know that was a technical term...:-))</p>

<p>Sidebar menu would be great - but need to make sure it will work for a wide variety of sizes of IGs - and that the sidebar retains proper context of where you are.  If someone wants to work on that, that'd be awesome.  (Also need to think about how it will work on mobile and smaller-screen devices.)</p>

<p>There is probably a javascript+bootstrap solution.   I have tried to implement in the past but no luck.  Can HL7 just hire a frontend developer to make it so?</p>

<p>Hiring a front end developer might be possible.  However, if we're going to go that route, we should come up with a complete set of requirements, including mock-ups and varying edge-case IGs to test with so that the investment is efficient.  We could then shop around to the various accelerators or others to sponsor/provide a grant.  (HL7 might have a budget for limited stuff, but if we're going to hire a UX person, I'd prefer to do it once and do it 'right'.)</p>
