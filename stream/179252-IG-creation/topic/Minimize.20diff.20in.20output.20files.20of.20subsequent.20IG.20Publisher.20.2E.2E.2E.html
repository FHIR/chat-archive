<p>Currently our IG Publisher output contains the actual dateTime:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>This profile was published on Fri Aug 20 07:36:59 UTC 2021</code></li>
<li><code>Generated 2021-08-20</code></li>
</ul>
<p>What options exist to have this datetime set to a value of choice (eg. fix to 2021-01-01 00:00:00) ?</p>
<p>Rationale: do not want every output file to change upon every run</p>

<p>The whole point <em>is</em> for the file to change every run - so that someone looking at a given page can distinguish what they're looking at from what someone else is looking at.</p>

<p>We use GitPages (from version control) and it explodes (many GBytes over time) because the timestamp changes in _every_ file, every run (commit/nightly dev builds)</p>
<p>Even if I make a small change in one resource, almost all files in the IG Publisher output change - due to the timestamp.</p>
<p>If only we could see the date end-up showing and chaning in only a <em>few</em> files, like the cover and footer (by reference, rather than by copy)</p>

<p>GitPages published from /docs branch in GitHub... - which is quite convenient to published developer docs (here: IG) related to the code (here: FHIR profiles) - via the build-pipeline.</p>
<p>Do not want to operate a separate webserver.<br>
And if I did, I would like the sync/update/transfer to it to be optimized, only upload concrete changes, instead of each and every file, each and every time.</p>
<p>Also think of the use case where the output ends up on a shared drive (OneDrive, others) - it takes _ages_ every run.</p>
<p>btw, next to date/genDate, there's also a changing bookmark <code>&lt;a name="fd08ffbe-485a-4f47-8983-0d9351539d28"&gt;</code> tag injected somewhere into every file - why not keep it fixed</p>
<p>I think there are many benefits (and ways) to minimizing the diff between IG runs - while keeping the current functionaliy. That optimization is what I am looking for :)</p>

<p>I've avoided this kind of git bloat issue in the past by using a separate <code>publish</code> branch specifically for the .html files to be served, and then using <code>git commit --amend</code> to avoid creating a new commit (and thus repo bloat) every time the files change. This will require force pushing the <code>publish</code> branch, but that seems ok if it's _only_ being used for seeding content to a web server.</p>
<p>(I use <code>git worktree</code> to check both <code>master</code> and <code>publish</code> out at once in separate folders to make it easy to copy content from one to the other)</p>

<p>i use github pages for a guide with similar reasons as John and I check in the output folder because I haven't set up the hooks to build it.  so it builds locally and I check in the output into a publish folder and then "bob's your uncle" and the guide is served to my closed community.</p>

<p>Is there a way we could put the "publication date" in a single JS file</p>

<p>not for static HTML publications, because it requires server side support, and that's not in the picture, but it doesn't matter there. For someone publishing through github pages, they have more options, and it could be done - a template thing</p>

<p>from David's original question I thought he could be simply missing a github workflow. <br>
I mean, we can minimize the impact of a) manually building the IG and b) manually uploading the output to gh pages, <strong>or</strong> perhaps we can just have gh pages without any of that manual work</p>

<p>The point is you have to commit your  entire output (typically to  /docs directory), but even after a small edit you must commit the entire ig output since all page are updated all the time. (I don't know any git tricks to avoid this since you don't necessary know a priori which files have been  updated  based on the edit and which are changed based on the updated timestamp.) I agree with the original proposal to have an IG parameter to override the dynamic datetime with a  static datetime.</p>

<p>I'm confused with why we need to commit the output. If we want to do manual work, yes. In the workflow I mentioned, the workflow builds and automatically copies the output folder to a separate branch (could be a separate folder), so there's no need to copy anything</p>

<p>as I've said a couple of times, my client is not interested in setting up a workflow.  They regularly have github pages set up with repositories and wanted the same thing for the FHIR IG.  Since we have an output directory already, this fit into their desires perfectly.  I don't have David's concern of changing every file on a commit, but saying "we've solved your problem by making you not check in your output folder" isn't the right answer.</p>

<p>I don't understand Jose.  The issue expressed is that people who use github pages want the number of commits to be smaller.  If instead of changing every file, we'd achieve that end with a change that would work for everyone, and everyone would still have a footer at the bottom of the page that said when the release was created.</p>

<p>We <em>want</em> the CI build to contain the date on every file.  But we <em>also</em> want most of the files to not change just because of the date.  If the footer says "display value returned by Javascript function X", where there's a small Javascript file that spits out the publication date, then that should satisfy both sets of requirements.</p>

<p>The dates in the footers of files, as well as the generated dates that sit inside of definitional artifacts ... these serve a function. (I could imagine a flag to the publisher that would override the bill time with something user specified... like <code>-overrideBuildTime 2020--01-01T00:00:00Z</code> if we really wanted to give people a way to get stable outputs.)</p>

<p>Is there any other way to get content to render on a static page without it living on that page?  Would "Github pages" be considered a server?  If they would and it would work on the CI-build or any other officially hosted server, do we care if the script wouldn't display the timestamp when you're just looking at a downloaded copy?  For that, we'd have the dates inside the zip file or on your harddrive...</p>

<p>Ok.  So seems like short-term solution is: override the footer in your template so it doesn't include the timestamp.  (And fix as many of your QA issues as you can.)<br>
Longer term solution: submit a Git issue against the <a href="https://github.com/HL7/ig-template-base/issues">base template</a> and - at some point - we'll see if we can get the timestamp to show up with out it changing every single page each time you build.</p>

<p>well, next version of the IG publisher will not generate uuids any more. It will use serial numbers unique in each file. This will be more stable (not deterministic though)</p>

<p>Wow thank you all :) waking up to a lot of good responses</p>
<p>I changed the title to describe the <em>problem</em> we have - and not per se imply a <em>solution</em>.</p>
<p>We use GitHub Enterprise as _Innersource_ - and when folks contribute to the FHIR profiles in our Git repo, we also use IG Publisher to generate updated developer views on those profiles.<br>
A GitAction runs the IG Publisher against the FHIR profiles on /master branch, and commits the generated output to our /docs branch.<br>
And indeed GitHub Pages is configured to take a specific branch (/docs for us) and deploy it automatically on the built-in "webserver". Our GitPages are private, company internal, not public.</p>
<p>Our problem is that if we run the Git Action 2x in a row - without any change of the underlying FHIR profiles - almost all of the output files have changes - leading to an overhead (on version control. on file syncs, etc.).<br>
So the /docs branch is exploding.</p>
<p>From the commit diff - and hence diff between subsequent IG Publisher runs - I noticed that this is due to (primarily) 1) changed date+genDate timestamps, and (sometimes) 2) &lt;a name="&lt;GUID&gt;"&gt; html bookmarks.<br>
The timestamps are the primary root cause.</p>
<p>Hence my initial request to see if there is a quick turnaround to fix/strip these dates - but I'd prefer a more structural approach to optimizing the output to minimize the diff in output files of subsequent IG Publisher runs on the same input. Since it it is good to have dates includes - see below.</p>
<p>I was able to remove the Generated from the footer, but can not readily remove the "date"attributes being added in the main page. Need to dig deeper in the templates.<br>
Note that our FHIR profiles in the repo do NOT have a date attribute - since the repo does timestamping at development time. Yet, the IG output does have these .date attributes filled with the genDate it seems.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, I think there is a difference between<br>
1) Last modified (for us the last change to a profile in version control) - which could be inputted via the FHIR profile .date attribute.<br>
2) Last build/generated - the timestamp of running the IG Publisher, doing validation, snapshot generation, and output rendering (genDate?)<br>
3) Last released/packaged (e.g. as part of a program increment/formal release cycle) - a special version of 1+2 - aligning all to a fixed, but customizable timestamp.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://profile.date">profile.date</a> element is not reliable.  Also, even if a profile is unchanged, the snapshot can change - either because of a tooling change (now uncommon but still potential) or because the underlying resource has changed.  Same goes for value sets where the page will include a snapshot of the expansion.  The 'publication' date is thus very important to know if you're looking at the same thing or not.</p>

<p>I agree, the current model is the more likely correct model. I struggle with how to do the right thing most of the time and for the dominant need; while having a special case to make this specific usecase more well behaved.</p>

<p>Thank you. Generating and sharing a regular dev build of an NPM+IG seems like a dominant need to me :) <br>
I do agree that timestamping such a build is highly preferable.</p>
<p>The current implementation - timestamping by copy - has become troublesome with GitHub Pages, for us at least. </p>
