<p>I generated the DTR Questionnaire – R4 StructureDefinition using FHIR Shorthand and noticed that the “Text Summary” tab indicates only 4 mandatory elements. Looking at the “Snapshot Table” tab, I can see there are 5 required fields; so “Text Summary” should indicate 5 mandatory elements.<br>
I posted this issue to FHIR Shorthand developers on a Slack channel and got back a confirmation that FSH does not generate any of the content that goes into the "Text Summary" tab. So this is potentially a problem with the IG Publisher. I am using IG Publisher 1.1.64.</p>

<p>Any chance you can provide hyperlinks to the profile in question?</p>

<p>I generated the profile in my local environment; so I cannot provide external hyperlinks at this time.<br>
It seems that the count of the mandatory elements showed on Text Summary does not include the required elements from the base profile-hence the discrepancy. <br>
You can look at the CQF-Questionnaire <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/cqf-questionnaire.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/cqf-questionnaire.html</a> as an example.<br>
The Snapshot Table tab shows that the “status” field is required, but the Text Summary tab does not indicate any mandatory element.<br>
My question: Is the mandatory element count showed on Text Summary supposed to include all required elements from both the derived profile and the base profile?</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> summary refers to the differential, not the snapshot.  (I've always found the summary view useless, so I totally ignore it.  It's on our list to come up with a better summary as part of IG template updates, but we're not there yet.</p>

<p>So I think this is a related issue. (Though not an issue - more like a question/request).</p>
<p>When you have a profile that is based on another profile - for argument's sake - "New Patient" based on  the US Core Patient where we are requiring that patient to have a race (so we've just changed min from 0 to 1 on the race extension).</p>
<p>Currently it appears that the differential tab for "New Patient" would ONLY show that one extra constraint. Which makes sense - presumably it's the differential from the next resource down in the hierarchy (i.e. US Core Patient).</p>
<p>The only issue is that, in a hierarchical case, this is kind of useless to get a proper view of what the profile really looks like... </p>
<p>You could go and look at the "Must support snapshot" table to get a fuller view of the profile, but even that is a little iffy (means you have to must support every single element).</p>
<p>You could also look at the "Snapshot" table but there is so much information in there that it's overwhelming.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to have a super useful "Differential from base FHIR Resource" tab - this would give an accurate view of exactly what the profile looks like i.e. all changes from the base resource?</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I have your exact case - Profile A based on US-Core Profile and I agree that a view with a differential from the base would be a great addition.  I have also been creating some abstract base profiles and then creating the implementable ones from that and that makes it even tricker to see what the real differential is.</p>

<p>Yes, we have the same issue with some abstract profiles.</p>

<p>My proposed changes to the "mustSupport" view would identify elements whose cardinality or constraints are changed from the base - at least if they're in-scope from a cardinality/mustSupport perspective.  (If you change the cardinality of a child element where the parent is unchanged, not mustSupport and not a modifier, the change from the base wouldn't show up - at least not as I currently envision the algorithm.)</p>

<p>It would be nice, but it's not an easy thing for me to generate. I'll add it to my long term todo list</p>
