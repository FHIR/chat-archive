<p>In <a href="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=23965" target="_blank" title="http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=23965">GF#23965</a>, I ask about allowing implementation guides to link examples to multiple profiles and provide a few situations where this can occur.  On the FHIR-I call today, we realized there are three different things we need to be able to accomplish:<br>
1. Identify that a particular profile/questionnaire/value set/other artifact is shown "in use" in a particular example (either the whole example or part of it).  If a part, it <em>might</em> be nice to be able to link to the specific place(s) in the example where the use is shown.<br>
2. We need to be able to indicate that an example as a whole or particular parts of the example are expected to be valid against a particular profile or graph definition<br>
3. We <em>don't</em> want to embed meta.profile declarations inside our instance examples in order to trigger #1 or #2 if there isn't an expectation that instance authors must populate (and instance receivers can count on the population of) the profile - because generally they can't.</p>

<p>1. Example: The same example instance might contain content that's valid against multiple SDC profiles (either because it's a single Questionnaire instance that happens to comply with the population, extraction and rendering profiles; or perhaps it has 'contained' value sets that comply with the value set profile or maybe it's a Bundle that contains a Questionnaire and a bunch of value sets and code systems which each comply with different profiles.  Each of those 'profiles' should be able to point to that example instance as "an example of this profile".   That means that the same instance might be an "example of" multiple profiles</p>

<p>2. Because SDC doesn't say you need to declare profiles in your instances, we don't really want the example instance above to declare meta.profile.  However, we <em>do</em> want to tell the validator that "within this Bundle, Questionnaire id 123 must be valid against the population, extraction and rendering profiles and value set #abc must be valid against the value set profile.  Right now, the publisher presumes that if you declare a profile, then the root instance has to be valid against that profile - it doesn't allow for the profile applying to a Bundle entry or a contained resource.</p>

<p>We could add an (extension) element to <code>ElementDefinition.example</code> that allows to specify a reference to an external example instance (instead of inlining examples in the profile). Multiple profiles could then point to a common example instance. However  it's probably better to capture this in the IG resource instead of the StructDef, for better separation &amp; reuse.</p>

<p>for 1,  why not add the profile to meta?  that is how it is prescribed in spec.  why even have it if we don't use  especially for examples.  That is how I validate against the profiles.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191336">@Michel Rutten</span>  if we have meta.profile why add this extension.

<p>for 2 see my response above, I don't understand why the example ( exemplars really) should not have the profile declared.  and yes I am being pedantic here instead of you for a change....</p>
<p>they are illustrative of how to do it and are presumed to be conformant so how else would you do that without the meta profile.</p>

<p>for 2 im still unclear what the issue <em>really</em> is,  is that the validator is not smart enough? or it is not possible technically to do this if each artifact in  a bundle or contained artifacts has a meta profile.</p>

<p>We don't want it in meta because that then makes implementers think that they need to put the profile in the instance - and other imiplementers think that they can expect to see the profile in the instance.  Neither are true.</p>

<p>It's not toxic - it's just not required or something implementers can count on.  We need to be cautious about putting that stuff in examples - and especially cautious about putting it in <em>all</em> examples, which would certainly set the wrong expectation.</p>

<p>Maybe this just shows how dumb I am, but I think populating meta.profile is perfectly fine and I would go so far as <em>requiring</em> the inclusion of the profile name in meta.profile. If someone sent an instance to an mCODE endpoint and that didn't declare the profile, I would not accept it.</p>

<p>This issue is raised because the IG allows indicating profiles associated with an instance, but only to a limited extent.  If we improve the ImplementationGuide, we may be able to strip the information out of the examples.  (From a maintenance perspective, it may well be that we include the profile declarations in the instance and move it into the IG definition as part of publication.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191447">@Mark Kramer</span> There will be tens of thousands of profiles.  Instances will be sent to machines that care about profiles the author has no knowledge of.  Therefore, receivers can't count on profiles being declared unless they're operating in a closed environment.  Profiles never change the meaning of an instance and are always ignorable, so forcing them to be sent is not appropriate.</p>

<p>so again if nobody is going to use meta.profile then why did we define it in the first place.  I contend it is appropriate to use in the IG example, but now I see you want to make a magic IG wide assertion on conformance to profiles - but that seems like a lot of work if we already have a way and it ( magic IG wide way )  not going to work that way in the real world so we are back to your original concern about misleading the reader.</p>

<p>There are times when it is appropriate to use meta.profile, and that’s why we defined it. But there’s lots of times when it isn’t, and this is important - there’s a tension between being explicit about profiles and allowing for wide reuse. for instance, in argonaut, we didn’t make the profiles explicit, which is great, because a set of entirely different resources built to rules that have entirely different history (say, interopen) can also happen to be valid. But if both interopen and argonaut had or do specify meta.profile, then you can no longer satisfy both sets of requirements, even though they are fundamentally compatible</p>

<p>So we don’t want the community to start using meta.profile everywhere simply because the IG authors needed to do that to get the validator to work. We want them to use it carefully where the benefits justifies the cost.</p>

<p>I had assumed currently within an IG you need the meta profiles for the ig validation to work for that profile.  Is that true?</p>
<p>so here are 2 suggestions:</p>
<p>If the Ig validator just validates for all the profiles of a type then if you only have a single profile for a type then just validate on the default profile,  if you have multiple types then add an extension to the IG resource for that instance  to define the profile(s) to validate against.</p>
<p>or </p>
<p>Add a boilerplate on each example pages  explaining  (unless we think nobody will ever read it ) :</p>
<ul>
<li>why there is a meta profile</li>
<li>and that is not appropriate in all use cases,</li>
<li>think about for your use case</li>
<li>and  there are other ways to specify a profile when you validate too...</li>

<p>Validating by type doesn't help when there are commonly multiple profiles per type - and some instances that aren't expected to be valid against any profiles.</p>

<p>why would you not validate against a profile in the IG if you define a profile for type?</p>
<p>anyway we are arguing over default behavior  - I think the lazier approach  is  to assume by all profiles of type  and explicity state otherwise  -   you think it is the opposite way</p>

<p>I'm worried about authors too and keeping the bookkeeping to a minimum by only only declaring the profiles that need to be explicitly profiled or none.   I'm assuming the only profile that the validators cares about are the inherited ones and the ones in the IG and most cases ( not lloyd ;-)) you only have a few profiles in your ig and all your examples are going to conform to those.</p>

<p>Coming late to this topic, I would favor an approach like 3  where I can specify for each profile which resource (or part of) is an example and the igpublisher would validate that example according to the profile, so instead of putting meta profile in the example and specify the exampleCanonical Url in the ImplementationGuide, directly referring  in the example having an examples (0..*) entry in the ImplementationGuide for each profile. On my wish list would be supporting examples for logical models, like CDA documents which could then directly be validated with the logical model and igpublisher, but then the igpublisher would need to be extended to handle non fhir resource content (no type/id guaranteed).</p>

<p>What I lean toward is:<br>
- when authoring, you embed profile declarations in your instance because that's the natural (and least error-prone) place to do it.<br>
- we have an extension that lets you flag profile declarations as "to be retained" (on the grounds that that's less common - and we want people to have to do extra work if that's what's needed)<br>
- remaining extensions get trimmed by the publisher process and the IG for each resource includes a list of paths based on id (e.g. <code>Bundle.entry.resource.where(id='foo').contained(.where(id='bar')</code> and for each path identifies what profile(s) should be enforced by the validator for that node.</p>

<p>The links in the IG would also be used to create cross-maps so that profiles could list their associated examples (including maybe hyperlinking to the correct Bundle.entry) and examples could include references to their "demonstrates profile(s)"</p>

<p>The problem is that the naive will not bother to set the extension - which will mean their examples will contain profiles when they shouldn't (and they won't notice or care).  Requiring the use of the profile, on the other hand, will mean that the naive will find their profile declarations are vanishing (and potentially causing validation issues) and will complain - and then get pointed to the extension after having been grilled on why they're mandating profiles in the instances.</p>

<p>Does the validator test the examples before or after the profile declarations are removed? <br>
If it tests after, naieve users will think that their examples pass validation when they are untested. <br>
