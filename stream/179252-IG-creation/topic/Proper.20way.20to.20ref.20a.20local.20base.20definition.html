<p>I have several Observation profiles all based upon a PhdBaseObservation profile. Therefore in these profiled Observation I have</p>
<p>&lt;baseDefinition value="<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/StructureDefinition/PhdBaseObservation" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/StructureDefinition/PhdBaseObservation">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/StructureDefinition/PhdBaseObservation</a>" /&gt;</p>
<p>That was valid for Forge/Simplifier, but I do not know if that is good for the IG publisher. When I try an publish, the publisher hangs on the first Observation  that references the base Observation</p>

<p>I am not sure if that is the cause of the hang but I can't think of anything else. Its about the only 'different' thing the Structure Definition has.</p>

<p>That's legal.  Is the target profile listed before the referencing profile?  (Failure to do that isn't an excuse to hang - just trouble shooting)</p>

<p>That was not the cause of the hang. I stripped everything out to have one very simple field and got it to work. The hang was (I think) trying to find something that I had not yet defined (or its not at the location it stated it should be ... yet).</p>

<p>there's no way it should hang... how do I reproduce this? (not that I'm having luck getting to actually have time to do this stuff - trying to clear out local things before heading to USA next week)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> I believe it was due to an resource reference that did not exist at the said location. Its not happening since I put one there. I am coming from Forge and refs are different.</p>
