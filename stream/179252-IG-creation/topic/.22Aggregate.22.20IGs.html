<p>Is there a way to create an "aggregate" IG?  In other words, what if I don't want to publish any <em>new</em> profile definitions, but rather want to assemble a unique grouping of existing definitions from other IGs?  Ideally the IG would publish those profiles/extensions in its own pages to avoid having to navigate all over the place.</p>
<p>I could (and probably would) copy over the profiles/extensions into the IG's "resources" folder -- but I'm not sure that this would work because, IIRC, the publisher won't process any profiles/extensions that are outside of its own canonical URL.  Is that right?</p>
<p>Follow-on question: what if I want mixed content?  What if I want an IG that <em>defines</em> some of its own profiles, but also "inlines" other profiles/extensions into the IG unchanged -- so that the IG can stand alone as documentation?</p>

<p>you can publish stuff with canonical URLs outside the IGs root, but it's a very bad idea for publishing/syncing reasons. why do you want to do that? Clone things and create version problems...</p>

<p>I understand there are certainly some dangers there.  We might need to do something like this to get around a short-term limitation in our own tooling -- so we're just trying to understand what is and is not possible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can envision a future where some IGs aren't about <em>creating</em> new definitions, but rather curating and assembling existing definitions for a particular purpose.  I think that eventually we should think about what such an IG might look like (in published form).</p>

<p>Maybe I'm confused but it seems that you want to make your IG dependent on other IGs and have your own profiles that don't depend on the other IG? So a way to override a dependency? Am I understanding correctly?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192587">@David Pyke</span> -- that's not exactly what I'm trying to describe.  Sorry if it's hard for me to express it!</p>
<p>The idea is that I might have a guide covering a certain topic -- and there are <em>already</em> profiles that would work well for this topic, but they are spread across multiple IGs.  I do not want to create my own profiles on top of them -- I just want to say that this IG declares that these are the profiles to be used: Profiles A and B from IG X, profiles C and D from IG Y, and profile E from IG Z.  My IG does not require that you support <em>all</em> of IG X, Y, and Z -- but rather, only the specific profiles I called out.  And I have nothing further to add to those profiles, so there is no reason for me to define new profiles based on them.</p>
<p>Ideally, I could create an IG like that -- and for usability sake, it would <em>not</em> require the user to have to navigate to those profiles in their source IGs -- but rather, the relevant details would be collated into my IG so there is a single consistent set of documentation.</p>

<p>I'll also note something that somebody suggested to me (which is a total paradigm change for FHIR, but interesting none-the-less)...  They wondered if profiles <em>should</em> be published independently -- so you just have a giant registry of versioned profiles and extensions -- and then <em>every</em> IG is really just an assembly of profiles into a guide.  E.g., IGs become 100% compositional.</p>

<p>This is a common thing that IHE does all the time. One must get the right governance. The new IG is defining a new context and use-cases, but re-using actors, transactions, and content from the previous IG. In this way you are leveraging re-use, while providing a new context for your reader. Even if that new context is simply changing the perspective at which one is viewing the exact same thing.</p>

<p>so, yes you are indicating in your aggregate IG that you are depending on the predicate IG... but for conformance claims you actually are calling upon the actors and transactions.... The benefit of this is that your aggregate IG can then pick-and-choose the actors and transactions it wants from the underlying IG.<br>
For example, eLTSS did this with US-Core based things...    Yes it says it is based on US-Core, but realistically it did not pull EVERYTHING from US-Core, it just leveraged (conformance) the things that are relevant.</p>

<p>Also I think it's helpful to make a distinction between specifying dependencies to computable FHIR artifacts, distributed via packages, as opposed to referring to external documentation (narrative). In theory, we could define something like a "filtered view" on a package (not implying we should....) to address the former.</p>

<p>The level of what we reuse may not be an entire IG - depends on how granular is the IG. But then again, if we can have aggregate igs, we are no longer bound to one granularity level. So we could have an IG composed of other igs, and we select which ones we want to aggregate.</p>

<p>I hear the concerns... I think there are concerns to both approaches.  I think one potential usability issue is that since the IGs all look so similar (by design), if a user has to navigate to other IGs to view external definitions, they may not even notice they're in a different IG -- but then when they use the nav menu in that IG (say to click "Home" or "Profiles"), they're now completely out of context from the original IG.  In my opinion it is really easy to get lost... and the only way to get back to the original IG is via the back button since there is no bi-directional linking.</p>

<p>I guess I don't fully understand the versioning issues you're concerned about.  I mean, versioning can be an issue in general.  But... if you can only include external content via specific references (to a specific profile in a specific published version of an external IG) -- and the tooling is responsible for building the content inline in the new IG (so the author can't modify it) -- then what is the additional versioning danger?  How is that different than me depending on another IG the way we do today?</p>

<p>As a developer, an aggregate IG would actually mean I have all of exactly the right profiles in a single place, with no additional profiles I don't need.  There is no way for me to mistakenly download the wrong version of a dependency profile.  Otherwise, if I'm responsible for going out to every dependent IG, and finding and downloading the right version -- that seems more error-prone to me.</p>

<p>If you're reading the CDS Hook spec and you click on an "in-guide" profile, you've still got quick-links to the rest of the guide in the menu.  If you click on one of the US-core profiles, you're outside.  Which means that users get a yuckier experience when we reference external profiles.  That's not really what we want to happen.</p>

<p>Different background color can differentiate IG from core, but hard to do with IG from IG - eventually we'll run out of colors.  The real issue is that you want the same feel for "referenced" profiles as you have for "local" profiles.  The US Core "encounter" profile is as much a 'part' of CRD as the locally-defined Coverage profile.  When you make navigating to each of them feel different (whether it's a new tab, new color, different menu, etc.), it's jarring.</p>

<p>I don't actually understand the problem with importing so long as the reference is to a stable release.  A specific version of CRD depends on a specific version of US Core.  If there's a new release of US Core, that doesn't impact CRD.  They only time a direct import would matter would be if there's a technical correction.  I don't have a sense that's going to be a common problem - and the only real impact is that if there's a technical correction on an imported artifact, then that should drive a technical correction on the importing IG.</p>

<p>You absolutely <em>can</em> rely on and reference artifacts from another IG without copying.  But sometimes it's nice to "import".  (Note that importing is different from copying in that the source remains the original IG, it's just that that IG's content is included as part of the rendering of the target IG.</p>
