<p>I know the build tool is now updating spreadsheets in the main build to make them more Git-friendly.  Has the same thing been done for IGs that are spreadsheet-driven?  If not, how hard is it to make that change?  Thus far I've worked on IGs where I was the only editor, so life was simple.  However, for the CG project, we'll likely have multiple committers, so a commit-friendly syntax would be helpful.  (And Forge doesn't yet have the capacity to support "current release" in a terribly manageable way.)</p>

<p>it's pretty straight forward to extend this to the IG publisher. I'll get to it once the build freeze kicks in - until then, everything is focused on the build</p>

<p>K.  CG will figure out a work-around in the meantime</p>
