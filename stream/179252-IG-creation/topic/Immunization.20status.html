<p>We want to record the childhood immunization status of a patient. Our current idea is to use Observation with an Australian code, as the status is the status against the Australian childhood immunization schedule. Is there a better way?</p>
<p>We intend to use the same approach for SARS-CoV-2 immunization status.</p>

<p>ImmunizationRecommendation allows for a recommendation where the status is "complete" (part of the example value set for .forecast status). But this may not be the best way to store data (immunization recommendations tend to be pretty much "just in time" and expire quickly). And ImmunizationEvaluation is for evaluation of a single dose, not an entire series. An Observation seems reasonable but you'll have to keep in mind that the schedules do evolve over time (especially, I expect, when the vaccine type is new) and so an observation from 6 months ago indicating a status of "protected" may no longer be accurate if the schedule has changed (for example to add an additional dose due to evidence of waning immunity over time). This is why we typically see the evaluation and recommendation being recreated "just in time" periodically.</p>
