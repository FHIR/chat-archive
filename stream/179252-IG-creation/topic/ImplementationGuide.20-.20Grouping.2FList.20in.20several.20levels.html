<p>FHIR-I would like some feedback on the proposed resolution for the following JIRA tracker: </p>
<p><a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-25458">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-25458</a></p>
<p>Repeated here for convenience:</p>
<p>Drop the notion of 'grouping' and grouping references from the ImplementationGuide resource</p>
<p>Define an IG Parameter that points to a List resource that defines the groupings to use when generating the table of contents (determines order of artifacts in the ToC).  Like the parameter for terminology settings, this can either be a file location or a # reference to a contained resource.</p>
<p>The base template will generate a list if you don't specify one.  If you don't use the template and don't specify the parameter, then the order of the artifact entries in the ToC will be arbitrary</p>
<p>The List can point to sub-lists if there's a desire for greater hierarchy.</p>
<p>Will use List.title for the grouping name and define a standard extension to allow providing a description of the List.  (Will make a change request to consider having this be a core element for R5?)</p>
<p>Will change the base template to produce the artifact list from the List resources rather than groupings.<br>
If someone wants to use the same mechanism to define alternate lists such that there are multiple orthogonal artifact lists navigable in different ways, they can, but only one can be primary and drive the ToC.</p>
<p>At some point, could explore whether some portions of the menu could be generated from these lists, but that's a separate discussion.</p>
<p>The anchor points used in the artifacts page would be driven by <a href="http://List.id">List.id</a></p>

<p>Thanks for this. Apologies for missing the call.<br>
I think the suggested resolution makes sense.  A few thoughts: </p>
<ol>
<li>With this solution, do we still need to list the resources in the IG? It would make sense if this solution also covers that. We could add an extension to replace implementationguide.resource.exampleCanonical.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd prefer List to overloading the usage of Composition.  A List of Lists seems to me to be a better organization than one large resource.  If we're going to have a monolithic resource, we can stick with adding levels to ImplementationGuide</p>

<p>The idea from Composition came when I was creating content - I realized that this is actually an authored set of resources, with a focus on presentation, and I realized that besides the <code>title</code> and <code>narrative</code>, the nesting would be really handy - you could say "This section contains the profile, and sub-sections are the examples" - this should look neat in the ToC and the template could pick it up quite easily</p>

<p><a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-25458">FHIR#25458</a> is only about the Artifact Index page; e.g., using <code>List</code> to control the artifacts and how they are listed / grouped.  I think <code>Composition</code> would be something interesting to look into for an entire IG, but it doesn't feel like the right fit for just listing artifacts to me.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> Yes, my idea (initially for List but also applicable for Composition) is that this would be supported in sushi - we'd have a fsh file (not necessarily sushi-config) and that creates the composition (and avoid those new extensions that were discussed recently). In my case, when I need to copy content across IGs, I would just copy the fsh files and I would not need to touch the ig.json - but that sushi feature would be a request for Sushi, once this Jira  is settled</p>

<ol>
<li>The referenced List would be pointed to by file-path.  So long as that was just in input or some other folder not searched for resources, it wouldn't show up in the IG.  (We didn't talk about the possibility of how to find <em>other</em> lists though...  I guess we'd need extensions that pointed to all of them.</li>
<li>That's actually somewhat appealing.  It has build in hierarchy and has both title and text, which takes care of label and description.  Composition is an 'organizer'.  It's fine if we're just using it to organize only the resources, not everything. The need to have independent Lists of Lists only really matters if you've got a tool generating some of the Lists and you're then compiling them into your own ordered List of Lists. <br>
If SUSHI is representing this, it should be the same way it represents Compositions (or Lists) generally - it shouldn't create a custom solution just for this I don't think.</li>

<p>One thing I did not think through was the impact of using Composition in multidimensional structuring of contents - I guess it would not change much?<br>
One Composition for artifacts grouped by type, other for artifacts grouped by topic (e.g. Vaccination vs Allergies vs Procedures).. (or one single Composition and different sections for each group)</p>

<p>The 'base' organizer used to generate the ToC can't be multi-dimensional.  Every artifact should appear in the hierarchy exactly once.

<p>I think I'll need to see this in action before fully understanding it, but SUSHI can support it in whatever way makes sense.  One of the things SUSHI does is try to support graceful transitions from configuration changes -- so I wouldn't be surprised if we at least supported converting the old way (via IG groups) to the new way (Composition?) for a period of time to ease that transition.  As for how else SUSHI supports it, I'd have to see how it shakes out before I comment further.</p>

<p>As I stated in JIRA:<br>
I'm still pretty strongly opposed to this. Seems like a lot of extra resources, references, and more, to support multiple people working on different sections of the groups of resources in an IG. I'm also skeptical that the List/Composition resource would even give you all the functionality we need to replace ImplementationGuide.definition.resource; what about things like <code>exampleCanonical</code> and <code>exampleBoolean</code>? It also needs to be easy to determine what resources are in an implementation guide, and it should be supported by the server's _has search parameters (ex: I should be able to say, list all StructureDefinition resources that are part of the XX ImplementationGuide).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> I've asked that we make some other improvements to the ToC before, as well :) I think the ToC is not very usable as it stands. I really would love for the ToC to be in a pop-up div on all pages, so that the user doesn't have to navigate to a separate page in order to look at the ToC. I'd also really like some search functionality on the ToC.<br>
At a minimum, I think it needs to be clear what each resource type is in the ToC, and the distinction between a page vs. a resource. In many cases, CodeSystem resources have the same name as ValueSet resources, so if they're both included in the same IG, then it is pretty much impossible to distinguish the difference between the two resources.<br>
However, I digress... I'd ask that if we're considering improvements to the ToC, that we meet and brainstorm amongst a group of us.</p>

<p>The rendering of the ToC is orthogonal.  The key thing is that there needs to be an ordered list of artifacts in order to produce a ToC.  It's also necessary to produce a navigable artifacts list.  When the list of artifacts gets too long (&gt;15 or so) you need to split them into groupings.  When it gets very long (&gt;150?) then you start to want a multi-layer hierarchy and perhaps even multiple orthogonal hierarchical ways of navigation (though one must be primary to allow a sequential ToC and section numbering).  Right now, we have no mechanism to support a multi-layer hierarchy in the ToC at all and no 'standard' way of maintaining one in IGs in general (though you could develop one manually, tooling can't check that it's complete/consistent).  We need a way to support that capability.</p>
<p>Note that the question of what artifacts exist and what examples they're part of is orthogonal to the question of groupings.  I'm still expecting the IG to include a complete list of all artifacts (and what examples they're associated with).  My assumption was that the Composition/Lists/whatever would simply point to the artifacts, not that they'd be the authoritative list of the artifact contents.  We still need names and definitions for artifacts, etc.  Those wouldn't live in Composition or List.</p>

<p>then the Comp/List is redundant and I am completely against that.   Why not allow the groupings to nest</p>
<p>as far as tooling -  use a file tree in the source and tell the tool to suck up and group based on that. it will still sort alphabetically but is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>So here's a first idea for the ExampleCanonical:<br>
For one conformance resource , all the examples would be listed in a sub .section.<br>
that .section.code would be "examples" and the .section.focus would be the conformance resource.<br>
In the TOC, the examples would appear under the conformance resource(s), because they are in a sub section.<br>
The template /publisher would create the internal links as usual.</p>
<p>This would also work for other things like history and testing</p>
