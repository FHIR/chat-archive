<p>Here is a summary of the first pass of warnings we would like to suppress for US Core:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code System URI '<a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/go/cpt">http://www.ama-assn.org/go/cpt</a>' is unknown so the code cannot be validated are not recognized by the validator due to IP restrictions - The valuesets contain CPT and am getting warnings in two places (see below)</li>
<li>Warnings about not following US Core Profile</li>
<li>Warning about no example for a US Core Vitals profile - this profile is a base used by several other profiles each of which has an example.</li>
</ol>
