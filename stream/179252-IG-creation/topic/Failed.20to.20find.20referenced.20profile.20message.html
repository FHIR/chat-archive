<p>I'm seeing these lines in the IPS IG build log (they aren't labeled as errors or warnings and they don't show up in qa.html):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>process res: CodeableConcept-uv-ips                                              (37.0041sec)

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>process res: Device-observer-uv-ips                                              (38.0850sec)

<p>I don't see any references to the specified referenced profiles in the resources that are shown as being processed immediately preceding or following these messages.  I don't see why either the CodeableConcept-uv-ips or the participant-uv-ips profiles would have any issues with being resolved.  Does anyone have ideas of what might cause this, and if it's really an issue?  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>?  or anyone?</p>

<p>Check for the id and canonical matching and the case being right in both the resource and the IG reference to it.</p>

<p>I've done it many times before and I tried to look again for mismatches as you suggest (definitely hard to do with the literally thousands of hits on <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/CodeableConcept-uv-ips" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/CodeableConcept-uv-ips">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/CodeableConcept-uv-ips</a> in the IG) and I haven't seen any mismatches so far for either of them.  I would look at the specific references in the IG that the messages seem to indicate, but, as I said before, I don't know where they are (if these "references" actually even exist).  The resources that are listed adjacent to these messages don't have any reference at all to the specified "referenced profile" in the message - so I don't really know where else at this point to look for something.  I think I may have to deconstruct the code to figure it where this is coming from, and I haven't done that yet.</p>
