<p>I have a question concerning a 'valid' example. All FHIR resources require a logical id. However, when generating uploads that are created, the logical id is specifically absent unless it is a temporary id in a Bundle. If my examples do not contain a logical id (valid for the implementer) would that be considered invalid by the validation process?</p>

<p>The examples reflect what would be returned by the server in a "read".  They're already "created" from a FHIR perspective.  The IGPublisher needs them to have an id so that they can be found/referenced/pointed to within the IG.</p>

<p>That would be misleading to an implementer of this IG since in most instances the logical id is forbidden in the upload. 95% of this guide is for those generating the resource on the gateway (this is the hard part).  what will happen otherwise is that implementers will add a logical id because the examples have it. This speaks strongly for having separate examples that illustrate what the profiles require and resource examples for those that might be on the server once uploaded.</p>

<p>You can put a comment in the XML and/or put comments in the "intro" section for the examples page that explains to not include the 'id' on submission.  Or implementers can discover it when they hit a test server or by reading the HTTP POST page.  But example instances included in an IG need to have ids.</p>

<p>I suppose one solution is to create the upload examples in a transaction bundle. This would have a logical id for the bundle and no ids in the resources (they would be temporary ids in the transaction and full URL).</p>
