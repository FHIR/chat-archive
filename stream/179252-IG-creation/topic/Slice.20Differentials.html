<p>When I create a slice, how much information should go in the slice's differential element(s)? <br>
(A) include all defined properties of the element(s) representing the slice - since the slice did not exist at all in the base resource<br>
(B) include only properties of the elements(s) that are different from the (now sliced) base element in the original resource<br>
(C) include only properties of the elements(s) that are different from the (now sliced) base element in the current profile</p>

<p>If slicing is done in the base and you're just adding a new slice to the list, you can presume that anything true of the 'slicing' element in the base and any further constraints on the 'slicing' element in your derived profile will apply to the new slice (and all inherited slices).</p>

<p>OK.  So the differentials only have to include what is unique to that slice.  Got it -- and it makes sense.  Thanks!</p>
