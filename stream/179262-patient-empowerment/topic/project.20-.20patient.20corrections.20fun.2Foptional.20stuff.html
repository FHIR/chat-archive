<p>The other thing I'd like to explore in connectathon is "structured requests" -- it's a feature Michele will rightly push back against as beyond-the-bare-minimum, but I think it'd be good to experiment. Basically: can I include in my request a bundle of FHIR Patches (or similar) that specifies <em>exactly</em> how I'd like things to change. An administrator would still review and accept/reject this, and wouldn't ever need to apply my patches verbatim... but I think it opens the door to more precise conversations and (over time) more automation.</p>

<p>My general leaning is that that's a cool idea for a phase II.  Not sure we necessarily want to bite it off initially.  First, reality is that much of the data patients will want to change won't be exposed via a REST API at all.  Also, actually making the change is (typically) a tiny part of the cost, so expending lots of effort in automating it isn't necessarily a huge value.</p>

<p>I agree with the assessment here; still think it's worth some early exploration.</p>

<p>I think there is nothing stopping you using task inputs to do that.  Josh - any chance you would be willing to participate as a server?  I know <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192825">@Jeffrey Danford</span> liked the idea of patches too.  But agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191912">@Michele Mottini</span>  and I am trying to listen to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="225094">@Debi Willis</span> that we need to prove the basics first.
