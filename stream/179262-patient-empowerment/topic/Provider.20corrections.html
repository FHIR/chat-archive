<p>Today an inverted use-case came up. Where a patient has recorded information in their PHR, and given the Clinician access; WHEN the clinician notices a value that is clearly out of wack (e.g. looking at weight measurements and sees what must be the patients cat of 12 lbs), THEN the clinician might want to send a correction request to the patient in a way that the patient can understand specifically who/what/where/why the correction.   --&gt; I think this should NOT be pulled into scope, it is just a re-use in a different scope later when we have our solution.</p>

<p>I love this because it spotlights the value of collaboration, aka <a href="http://participatorymedicine.org">participatory medicine</a>!</p>
<p>Are there things we could/should do now, in our design of PATIENT requested corrections, that would simplify the mirror-image workflow someday?</p>

<p>I would caution to not expand the scope... just keep this near.</p>

<p>I certainly agree!  I was only suggesting that we keep it in mind in case some decision arose where it was just as easy to enable the reverse workflow someday, vs unthinkingly closing it off.</p>
