<p>Pt Empowermt WG members, please see the email I just sent out with subject line "Important webcast last week on how data sharing has worked out". It's about the OpenNotes webcast last week. They did a super job of publishing the assets that resulted - the slides and video as usual, plus a 4 page doc of answers to additional questions they  didn't get to.</p>
<p>I hope to blog it soon but didn't want to wait.   For others not on the listserv, here are some links</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVUZ4IqGBUU&amp;feature=youtu.be">The recording</a><div class="youtube-video message_inline_image"><a data-id="DVUZ4IqGBUU" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVUZ4IqGBUU&amp;feature=youtu.be"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DVUZ4IqGBUU/default.jpg"></a></div></li>
<li><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/8c612d93601/f09fc337-0fc0-45e3-89d2-54c6ba2606a8.pdf">The slides (PDF)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This will be an important asset to our movement because, as I've often said, OpenNotes has spent ten years answering all the recurring objections or curiosities people have about the crazy idea of letting patients see their health data. </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256347">@Jan Oldenburg</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="270306">@Maria D Moen</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191531">@Virginia Lorenzi</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="225094">@Debi Willis</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="222957">@Dave Hill</span> I tagged you in the email because of relevance to your projects in our WG.  Seems to me we want our work to have a well developed relationship (at least mutual awareness) of what we're doing and its intersection with their work.</p>
<p>One example slide (emphasis added):<br>
