<p>A friend got vaccinated yesterday. The "receipt" they gave him listed the wrong arm. He asked them to fix it. Here's the bureaucratic burden they threw back in his face.  ARG.  Note that they said the info was "incomplete," not WRONG.</p>

<p>My thumbs down above is for "the system" producing that "correction procedure", not for your post, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span>  ! </p>
<p>On that note, thanks so much to all those contributing on the Patient Corrections stream in general. Even those of us not contributing much are learning a lot - this stuff ain't easy!</p>
