<p>Hey USCDI gurus:  a question arose in email: This "brings up the question of the continuing relevance of USCDI at all, since by the time any updates would be implemented “all EHI” would have to be provided by regulation.  Did the group discuss this aspect?"</p>
<p>Someone replied </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “all EHI” in the mandate does not require the covered entity to provide the data in FHIR format. I believe USCDI is specific to FHIR format. So, identifying the most important elements we would like to be shared via FHIR is important and relevant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reality check on all the above, anyone?</p>

<p>Yes, that reply is basically right. ONC has a path forward for standardized data (USCDI) and a path for all data whether standardized or not (EHI Export). The idea is that over time, USCDI chips away at the size of the "dark" (non-standardized) data -- though in practice health science keeps growing, so I doubt the gap will net shrink.</p>

<p>My personal take is that non-standardized data will be with us forever (we'll never standardize everything; the frontier keeps moving) and will be super damn useful, so I'm dismayed that ONC's EHI Export requirements include no concept of automation.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> under HIPAA data can be shared for TPO without a patient moving it.  When you sign the HIPAA form you "know" that.  The way covered was used just meant covered entity provides an API (through which one could request data).  Also, while it is clear that all data, standardized, is desired, that is not what ONC is asking for sadly.</p>

<p>Josh said it best.</p>
<p>Simply best, the EHI rule is so vague that it'll just come down to how EHRs implement it. </p>
<p>USCDI's benefit is its uniformity. So it's relevant and powerful, assuming we get that ubiquitous uniformity.</p>

<p>I disagree with Josh on the usefulness of non-standard data. Mainly because there will be no agreed upon context for the data, and without an understandable context the data will not be useful. </p>
<p>We've seen that when claims data was <a href="https://www.healthimaging.com/topics/health-it/google-health-stumbles-over-insurance-claims-data">attempted to be used for personal health information</a> it didn't work. I think even <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span> had similar experience, and I believe that it is that lack understood context that will severely limit the usefulness of non-standard data.</p>
<p>USCDI, on the other hand, can help provide a sustained expansion of standardized data sharing with the appropriate support of the US Core IG. I just hope that the effort expended for the required implementation of EHI export doesn't get in the way of the continued development of USCDI.</p>

<p>Yes, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192685">@Vassil Peytchev</span>, your link is about my case. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span>   It was what involuntarily launched me on this crusade 11 years ago, and was a core part of my ten part series last year on why FHIR is essential: <a href="https://tincture.io/an-information-quality-trainwreck-google-health-revealed-the-mess-in-my-hospitals-data-5f3eef4e2dc3">An information quality trainwreck: Google Health revealed the mess in my hospital’s data</a></p>
<p>BUT - and importantly - this very much does not mean there should be any limits on what data can be moved around, because creating those limits means we have decided <em>a priori</em> that there couldn't possibly be any value to that data being moved around.  We (all) are in no position to know what in that "big fat file folder" might be needed and why. </p>
<p>It DOES mean, though, that while we should allow it all to get moved around, we shouldn't at all assume that it's valid.  History has taught us that it can contain lots of garbage as well as gold (and tin etc). </p>
<p>In short, the usefulness <em>for automation</em> is severely limited by the unknown content of that blob of stuff - but to me that simply means that a blob is a blob and its <em>processing</em> cannot be automated.  But blobs cannot be disallowed.</p>
<p>This may be worthy of further discussion &amp; documentation by this WG, if people feel that way.</p>

<p>I believe Dave's case was actually an example of creating a <em>standardized</em> data payload (CCR? CCD?) with the wrong data (clinical fields incorrectly populated with information from claims). Data quality is a persistent problem no matter how you write things down -- but the more pressure there is to write things down in a "standard" way, the easier it becomes for Dave's story to repeat itself (because sometimes when you are focused on strictly following a standard, you lose the ability to convey nuance and context).</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I love standards, but it's unfair to say that non-standardized data (particularly) will lead to these kinds of misinterpretation issues.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191531">@Virginia Lorenzi</span> I too am feeling like we have more than enough with our IG and WP projects; we're already bumping Pt Contributed Data out of the current session.  </p>
<p>Co-chairs <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="225094">@Debi Willis</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191678">@Abigail Watson</span> what are your thoughts?</p>

<p>USCDI next week is fine with me.</p>

<p>I agree about drawing people in.  I really just want to get suggestions for USCDI to PAC since they will be making final decisions anyway.  They are on a short timeline to pull it all together and we may run out of time.</p>

<p>what is their short timeline?  I wonder if we can collect the suggestions you seek in some format besides meeting time</p>
