<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="308467">@olivierkarasira</span> thanks so much for your presentation, and even more for your work. Of all the work I've seen, it feels to me that you have the most prospects for making a real difference to people's lives, and it's exciting for us to see adoption of what we're doing in Africa, which we're keen to support.</p>
<p>You end your video by asking us to help. Great - how can we help?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="308467">@olivierkarasira</span> !  Loved your talk at devdays today.  I was curious if any of the medical records you are trying to access exist electronically and if so what EHRs are used?</p>

<p>Also, I was confused with what you meant by data license.  Did you mean a kind of identification, like a driver's license, or did you mean the opportunity for someone to license a dataset?<br>
Or something else?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="308467">@olivierkarasira</span>  have you considered what happens when the children grow up?  we think about that alot.  In the US we have laws that prorect adolescent confidentiality and start giving adolescents their own access.  Also, if you as an adult consent to the sharing of your child's data  beyond the care context, what will that mean for them when they are older?</p>

<p>Hi Grahame ,  thank you  for the comment this is really encouraging us .<br>
We need support  on the following : <br>
 •  FHIR resources to consider  students behavior and cognitive load capacity reports from schools<br>
•   To improve the technical and structure of educational platform we are using to be more useful to health and fhir. <br>
•   To access to technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP), Watson (IBM) to easy parents and data champion when collecting health data.</p>

<p>Do you have (non-identifying) examples of the reports?<br>
In terms of OCR/NLP/etc., are you looking for technology licensing or something else (those wouldn't be standards organization activities, but it's possible some of the organizations who hang out here might be able to help.</p>

<p>Looking at your other ideas... a key underlying enabler is to build the community of people who can make things happen for your platforms and services. We've been really struggling to get a FHIR community going in Africa. If we collaborated to create a FHIR community  in Africa (through events, online communities, teaching courses, hackathons, cloud solutions), would this help with those things?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191531">@Virginia Lorenzi</span> </p>
<p>Hi Virginia, thank you for your support. As you can imagine, the EHR situation in many part of Africa is very basic. When they are available (not often) access is not possible for patients, and paper is the way things are done for most patients. So we are starting by putting the data from paper directly in  people’s mobile phone by transforming it manually. So, 1) their data can follow them anywhere. 2) and if it is in FHIR and SNOMED CT, then it can be interoperable and we hope can be accessed elsewhere (anywhere in the world?), and more in the future on the ground in Africa too. Medical professionals here in Rwanda and Burudni don’t know anyone doing this kind of things yet. We hope it can give better data and better health</p>
<p>About Children’s  and adolescents rights<br>
Could you please ask this to The Sovereignty Network? We are using their platform, and just started. What I know is that they have done patient record permissions before, and they know how to do detailed access. I know there will be ability to transfer to the child the record when they are adult.</p>

Data license. Yes, I mean license a data set. It is our data. If we have it we should be able to license it. if we can make our own copy, it is our personal property. There are many researches done in Africa. E.g. pharamaceutical. If we make very good records for research, then we the people can benefit better from that.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> <br>
we are using the 5 personality traits ( for behavior)   and bloom taxonomy ( cognitive load )  approach for  the  educational  platform, we  capture  electronic data with teachers mobile phone in the class.  But now  we are brainstorming how to connect with FHIR ,  I would like to know any expert for behavior and cognitive load working with FHIR converter. </p>
<p>Oh Grahame, that would be very nice. We are first in Rwanda and Burundi, we think. And of course we would like to collaborate with others in FHIR in Africa. And we also want to collaborate outside Africa, so we can learn. Community in Africa is so important. We combine Education with Health, they cannot be separated from each other here. That is my mission. And Community is also part of Health. I want to build up teams of Data Champions, who can help regular people get their paper data transformed into FHIR. I have spoken a lot about this with Hamish MacDonald about this. Do you know him?</p>

Hello Lloyd, nice to meet you. Can I ask you to talk to The Sovereignty Network about reports? We are using their platform to do our activity, and turn paper into FHIR!  they have many plans to help us as “Data Owners” then use the data , e.g. reports. Because as we have learned from them. It is our data, and we should own it. And we should get benefit from it.</p>
<p>OCR  NLP etc. Anything that helps us do manual entry more efficiently would be very nice. Also, we want to do QA on the data we enter. The more time we can do QA instead of manual entry, the better. But I worry we don’t have money to pay license fees.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="308467">@olivierkarasira</span> is there any chance you can get someone from Sovereignty Network to join here?  It'll be easier to have the conversation with them if they can see the context of the discussion.  Something like personality traits would normally be captured in FHIR as Observations.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> <br>
We do two things before sending data to Sovereignty. First, we help the person get their source data (usually on paper). Then we manually transcribe the data into medical terminologies like SNOMED and LOINC. Then with patient permission and confidentiality we send the data to Sovereignty and they create a personal account, this account is owned and controlled by the person. They then convert the data we transcribed into the personally owned account in their FHIR Server. So it is the Sovereignty platform where the data is converted in FHIR, under the ownership and control of the individual. They showed us how to do this. It completely changes the game for us in Africa. We can do things that we could not have imagined before. We can do all of this just on our PC and mobile phones.</p>

Hi Lloyd, I talked to Hamish MacDonald, CEO of The Sovereignty Network, I don’t think he has access to this channel. But I asked him your question.</p>
<p>To be clear there was no personality traits or behavioral data sent from us to the Sovereignty FHIR Converters. It was things like conditions, labs, medications etc. But before I meet Sovereignty a month ago I spent many years trying to measure cognitive load and behavioral issues in collaboration with teachers , so I am would like to have that data represented in FHIR too. Any advice and suggestions in this area very appreciated.</p>

Schools are the perfect environment  to build this culture of  owning and  keeping health data updated in Africa  ,  parents and schools work together to raise children  so each side  has important  information  we can use as health diagnosis.   At schools level  we can easily  structure rules to follow  students  health by  enhancing the relationship between schools,  parents and data champions ( they collect and clean files  for any clinic visit of the student ). Once the values of health data is clear to parents, we can  easily onboard them too.</p>

<p>This makes me think, too, that we've repeatedly seen (in the US at least) that schools are the place where culture change can be effective.  If I recall correctly seat belt use, tobacco and recycling were all addressed successfully by teaching the children, who brought the message home to parents (and grew up with it of course).</p>
<p>I mention this because here I see a chance to do something some of us have envisioned: teach people <em>early</em> in life to get engaged with their health data, as a way of being involved with their health.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="308467">@olivierkarasira</span>, I would love to have a conversation with you to see how we can help you. We have been collecting patient data on paper and sending it into electronic medical records, research databases, or any other place. We can also send it to multiple places at the same time. We can send it anywhere and in any format. We are collecting many different kinds of data including medical records and SDOH. It is used in schools, homeless shelters, and medical clinics using both paper and electronic formats. The data is then converted, scored when necessary, and sent to wherever it is needed. If you’d like to chat, we can see if we can help you.</p>

<p>Hello <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="225094">@Debi Willis</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="308467">@olivierkarasira</span> let me know about your offer of help regarding collecting patient data on paper and transforming it. We would very much like to talk with you about that. If your systems are able to upload the data to our platform's FHIR Server to make the manual data processes quicker and more efficient for our "Data Champions" like Olivier and his team, that is something greatly sought after. I had a look at your product lineup and got very excited looking at your Wellness Visit Quality Data Capture and Scan Forms as only healthcare data geeks can! :)  I do believe there is lots of scope for your clinic products too moving forward. Business-wise, we have designed the platform for companies like yours that offer needed services to offer them directly to the people that want to use them. Would you like to chat next week with us? Between Rwanda, the US and New Zealand let's see if we can work out a time that doesn't cause too much insomnia for one or more parties!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="225094">@Debi Willis</span> <br>
Thank you again <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  for the encouraging note at the closing day of DevDays competition.  My team is back to work with hope and courage to accomplish what we have committed to do with the FHIR community.  As a member of The Sovereignty Network, we have access to their FHIR server and their data converters that can handle a wide range of data types, so we can be Data Champions, but we desperately want to make our data sourcing and our data transcribing process more efficient.<br>
The hardest part of our work is to collect papers after a patient clinic visit then clean them, we spend so much time and manual energy here and I'm sure technology can help. For example, OCR and NLP and voice recognition technologies might make the transcribing of sourced paper data quicker.  And if there is something we can check the quality of the transcribed and cleaned data output we do (QA) that would also be good. E.g. Any system or experts who can help check our accuracy of using Shrimp (to find the SNOMED CT “magic number”).<br>
If we can get better, we would like to do not just as Data Champions working for Data Owners in Africa, but we would also like to do this as an outsourcing service for Data Owners around the world. We have the motivation, and cost advantage in Africa gives us an advantage we can use to give good value at reasonable price.<br>
Finally, as Hamish and I always talk about, making people’s mobile phone as the “true source of data” in Africa is possible, because we have such few EHRs to begin with. Maybe this is actually our advantage in Africa to create interoperable health record for everyone on their mobile phone! And this can be good for the value of Data Owner data so they can make income by licensing later on The Sovereignty Network to healthcare companies like pharmaceutical and for R&amp;D.</p>
