<p>This is INCREDIBLY important; never in all my travels have I heard about this, but it seems EVERY patient / advocate who dives into this should be aware of it - and insist on it, yes??</p>

<p>Not sure what more to add <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> We have the ability for a practitioner to mark a doc as an in error status. This means it's still in the system if someone made decisions on it/legally but it wouldn't be displayed to any physician unless they were looking for in error documents. Most other concepts in our system have similar capabilities, though sometimes I think it gets marked as "cancelled" and the reason is error - this results in the same functional flow</p>

<p>This is common. The IHE Document Sharing HIE (e.g. XDS) also has this capability.   They don't go away, but they are hidden unless you indicate you are looking for things that have been marked deprecated.</p>
