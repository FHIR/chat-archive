<p>I'm loving the plenary including Dr Khoe's session now.  But on behalf of patients everywhere, I'll submit a collective eye-roll for the surprise expressed when she was forced to learn how to do televisits:  "They've been driving an hour each way because they want to see me - and now they can do it without that!"</p>
<p>It's all good - I'm not complaining - it's simply amazing to watch smart people have realizations we've been trying to share with them for eons.</p>
<p>Change takes time.</p>
