<p>The URLs didn't paste in, but here's a recap of what you'll find under subject line "[patients] Good stuff on Thursday's agenda!":</p>
<p>Please give a couple minutes to scan <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=91982861&amp;draftShareId=003652bb-0c68-4028-ad6d-05d093ced21b&amp;">the agenda</a> your co-chairs just drafted.  Any edits or additions??</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jan &amp; Maria, see the mention of your project. Let us know if you want more or less time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virginia amplified our WG's existing calendar by adding an excellent Project Timelines calendar to our Calendars page. During the meeting she'll walk through it for us.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Trust me, this is easier to watch than to sort out on your own. :) That is, of course, unless you're a Confluence guru.  </li>
<li>And we realized we'd love to have an experienced Confluence / Jira guru to answer occasional questions for us ... are you one, pretty please??  You don't have to take on an ongoing responsibility - just get us unstuck from the Atlassian mud on occasion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re the September WG meeting: Virginia and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192587">@David Pyke</span>  conspired to add a bonus session between our WG and the Consents WG.  She will discuss.</p>
<ul>
<li>As you know, Consents are one of our official areas of interest, and this is a rare chance to "merge meetings" in real time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Busy agenda ... read ahead and don't be late!</p>

<p>Looks like a good agenda Dave! I just wanted to note that unfortunately I will be unable to participate in tomorrow's call due to another commitment.</p>
