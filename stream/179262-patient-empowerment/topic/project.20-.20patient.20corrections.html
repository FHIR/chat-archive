<p>Like this. My understanding is -  A patient requests that their smoking status is corrected - I DON"T SMOKE!  The clinician is not able to update the smoking status directly but instead amends the field with a corrected note.</p>

<p>Provenance is the right solution. Given that the old and new version of the target resource exist (provided versioning FHIR), one can always see the DIFF. Thus the Provenance covers the DIFF made between old and new.<br>
The Provenance would point at the old, and new as normal; but would also have an .entity that points at the patient request to change.  Thus it is clear WHY.<br>
I might argue that it is even appropriate to record a Provenance for a requested change that resulted in no change.</p>

<p>The requested change would be a Task.  If there was a Provenance it would be on the status change of the Task.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>   I have checked with medical records departments of two hospitals and I know certain data fields do not have the same formal process for correction.  For example - demographics changes do not require the same formal process.  I checked my patient portal to see what it would allow me to update (and then it auto-flows back to EHR) - I could update all demographics, emergency contact information, and insurance.  I have a feeling I might be able to update my own med list as well but lets ignore that for now.  Clinical correction requests fall into the formal process.</p>

<p>Another question.  There is a formal paper process in which a patient requests a change to a clinical part of their record.  The provider sends correspondence saying request received and status.  Clearly the response to the request will not be synchronous.  And the actual change is not the indicator the change happened - a formal communication saying the change occurred.  Lets say I use Task.  Do I do an API PUT Task to the EHR?</p>

<p>First step would be a POST of the Task to the EHR (to create it).   Then the patient app would either poll the Task (query on a semi-regular basis) to see  if it had changed or subscribe to the Task to receive a notification of when it had changed.  (Because patient apps wouldn't likely have reliability availability or location, polling would presumably be most common.)  The EHR would update the Task to change status &amp; business status.</p>

<p>A Task links both worlds.  You can't <em>have</em> an 'event' Task.  A Task is always a request - but it captures information about the event.  So Task.intent captures the nature of the request.</p>

<p>I just want to capture a signal moment on this subject from 2009.  <br>
<a href="https://participatorymedicine.org/epatients/2009/04/the-parable-of-the-wicked-emr-guest-post-by-david-kibbe.html">The Parable of the Wicked EMR</a></p>
<p>After my Google Health / billing codes fiasco, HIT consultant David Kibbe drew a parallel with "the wicked Bible," a story from the early days of printing, in which every print shop did its own typesetting. In one edition, the printer omitted the word "not" from the 7th commandment, so that it read "Thou shalt commit adultery," and printed many copies.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the bishop was not pleased.  The lesson is that once an error exists, it's all too easy for it to propagate. And the existence of a single source of truth does not guarantee that all copies derived from it will be accurate.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  Debi get a great presentation of the use case.  You, Vassil, and Amit missed it.  I think we should do it again on one of our regular calls you guys can attend and you can tell others.  I think it will help give perspective and Debi can answer questions.  The people who suggested various things knew those things especially well as it were.  Example Rick said composition.  In all fairness the workflow guys (you, Vassil) said Task.  Others said do just Puts and posts of the resources and have business rules on server side behind the puts and posts.  And I am not sure who mentioned Communication.</p>

<p>Other issues, however, are more significant. </p>
<p>Several years ago, a doctor accidentally marked Diabetes on an MRI order form, and somehow that added the problem to my health condition list. When that specialist sent the notes to my primary doctor and my rheumatologist, then they added Diabetes to my health conditions and suddenly people were asking me what my glucose levels were. They seemed very concerned when I told them I had no idea!</p>

<p>We need to create a way to solve this!  </p>
<p>One factor is that evidently when clinicians see a new problem on the problem list, THEY ASSUME IT'S CORRECT without evaluating it.  Is that a valid practice??   </p>
<p>Would the erring provider feel embarrassed to know they had totally caused an important mistake in the patient's chart that could cause harm??</p>

<p>This is grotesque: "If it's in the chart it must be true," mixed with "If it's wrong in the chart, it's the patient's fault."   No HL7 standard can fix that - it's not my point - but it sure does affect the challenges of getting people interested in implementing whatever we do.</p>

<p>It's always instructive to learn more details about <em>how</em> this problem came to be incorporated from an MRI order form into a problem list.</p>
<p>But managing problem lists is hard, often based on sketchy data, often for patients much less knowledgeable and engaged that Morgan -- and it's often a cross-organizational challenge where nobody is really responsible for the holistic result. <a href="https://library.ahima.org/doc?oid=104997#.X3zfCXWYVhE">https://library.ahima.org/doc?oid=104997#.X3zfCXWYVhE</a> has some nice context -- e.g., "most organizations struggle to define content, responsibilities, and accountability for maintaining an accurate, updated problem list.").</p>
<p>(Add to this the fact that we have incentive systems that often pay more for higher-complexity cases, determined in part by problems documented in a problem list, so there's not always super-clear motivation to proactively clean things up.)</p>
<p>So my guess would be: yes, a clinician would probably be embarrassed to know they had done this, but at the same time, the problems are more <em>systemic</em>, and the erring clinician is only one piece of the story.</p>

<li>New eye doc's staff does the usual stupid "tell me your whole history" intake interview including med list</li>
<li>Mom mentions a med that's <em>usually</em> prescribed for Type 2 diabetes, but not so in her case. </li>
<li>Stupid clerk adds T2D to problem list without asking.</li>
<li>An hour later, discussing her conditions, doc says "So I'm going to schedule you for surgery."</li>
</ul>
<p>My mom, being my mom, asks why. He says "Ordinarily we'd use Drug X, but we can't because you have diabetes."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What's the difference between Task.for and Task.restrictions.recipient?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Task.for can be for a group, and in that case you may need Task.restrictions.recipient to specify one particular member of the group. For patient corrections, I don't think you need anything in Task.restrictions</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a request is denied, that would show in Task.status. However, how do we provide an explanation for the denial?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Task.statusReason can contain an explanation for the denial</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you do conditional cardinality? (considering this because on fulfiller side, owner should be supported but requester might not know it)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The initial owner is the healthcare organization. It can then be updated to become more specific, but you probably don't need conditional cardinality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where in Task do you specify the Encounter this correction is in reference to? @Lloyd McKenzie said its not Task.encounter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is likely one of the Task.inputs - task.input.type is a code indicating "relevant encounter" and task.input.valueReference is a reference to the Ecnounter (or encounter identifier).</p>

<p>Task.for is the 'record' the Task is associated with.  Task.restrictions.recipient has different meaning depending on the type of Task.  If the Task is "please fulfill", then it would be as Vassil said.  If it said "please share with", then that would indicate who to communicate the information to.</p>
<p>If the owner is not known when the Task is created (e.g. posting somewhere for central dispatch), then you'd mark it 'mustSupport' but optional.  In your case, the original owner should be known - though it may change as the Task gets punted around within an organization as they try to figure out who should actually ask on it.</p>
<p>Agree with Task.input to indicate relevant encounter or other filters</p>

<p>A design  best practice question.  If there's a field in Task that we think is irrelevant and its cardinality is 0..something should we set it to 0..0 or leave it be?</p>

<p>If we have a bunch of values in Task.input, how is the receiver going to know what to do with them?  I guess we would need to define codes?   For example, lets say I send text with a description of the desired correction, a picture of the error on the patient portal and an encounter reference of the encounter in which the error occurred.  How will the receiver know how to process that?  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192685">@Vassil Peytchev</span> had also suggested we send other resources to give context, like send the Condition resource if the condition was in error...</p>
<p>What about Task.focus?  Could Encounter go there?  Or another resource?</p>

<p>Ideally you'd only ballot in the spring.  Our usual target for FHIR IGs is one ballot and done (because the content is tested and pretty solid before it's balloted) and because some degree of substantive change between ballot and publication is acceptable).  Certainly the first release timeframe would only let you build against R4.  Also, R4 is all you'll see in production for the next 3 or so years.</p>

<p>How do we implement partial accept and partial reject?  Imagine the med rec dept gets a request for a correction from a patient - it is pros and refers to two errors.  The med rec department, after working with clinicians determines that the first request is valid and accepts it, but that the second is not and rejects it.   WOuld the request fulfiller system then spawn one or two subtasks with task.partof pointing to the master task and with one having status of accept and the other having status of reject?  Or is there another way you would recommend?  I do not think we have a failsafe way to ensure that the requester provides discrete atom level items for correction for each request so I think this problem will happen.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192685">@Vassil Peytchev</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span></p>

<p>Ideally, they're handled as two different requests - as each may be independently routed and independently resolved.  The other option is that the receiving systems spawns subtasks for each issue and managers and resolves them each.  The overall Task gets marked as 'completed' when all of the child tasks are dealt with.</p>

<p>The problem with "we did this but that" is as follows:  HIM can agree to do the correction, but it doesn't mean they've done it yet.  If HIM (medical records) rejects a particular part, there is a disagreement process the patient could then initiate.  </p>

Looking at that resource, it appears to be a request to communicate with someone.  That was not our intent.  We actually wanted to communicate right then.  More like, we want to message the provider.  Currently, portals have secure message capability and through a patient portal you can send a message to your provider.  However, in the fhir apis provided by EHRs, there is no way for a patient app to get a message into that provider inbox using fhir.  Patients may have many different insights they would like to share with their doctor and there is no way to just send a basic message.  The Communication resource seems the most like that.  The Communication resource is not a request but represents the actual communication. I read in the definition: "A communication is a conveyance of information from one entity, a sender, to another entity, a receiver. The sender and receivers may be patients, practitioners, related persons, organizations, or devices."  So I got excited <span aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes" class="emoji emoji-1f601" role="img" title="grinning face with smiling eyes">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span> and thought wow this could be that message.  But the Communication resource went on to say: "This resource is a record of a communication that has occurred. It does not represent the actual flow of communication." <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span> Kind of like I called the doctor on the phone and then a communication resource was sent to document that.  So what resource would be used to just send a free text message to a fhir enabled inbox?    This is not to detract from all our work from Task, but it seems having a basic patient/provider messaging capability between patient apps and ehrs using FHIR and NOT direct protocol would be really useful.</p>

<p>CommunicationRequest is not really appropriate here.  CommunicationRequest is an authorization for data to be shared.  What we're looking at here isn't an authorization to share, it's a request to make a change.  CommunicationRequest is not the appropriate resource. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that we're <em>always</em> communicating information with FHIR.  That doesn't mean that we're always using Communication or CommunicationRequest.</p>
<p>If your sole objective was to just represent "secure email" over FHIR, then you might use Communication to convey the text blobs from one place to another.  You could use that to do pretty much anything - request an appointment, ask for a referral, ask a question about a lab result, request a correction.  But it wouldn't accomplish anything more than an email would.  No computability, no control over behavior, no searchability, etc.</p>

<p>We have an is/ought dilemma, between how people ought to implement the APIs in an ideal situation and what's formally defined and semantically consistent and ideal, versus what's currently available.  Having a CommunicationRequest to discuss a Task might be a perfectly valid workflow for a file room somewhere that's operating a help desk and call log, and completely invalid elsewhere.  </p>
<p>Before presuming what the provider workflow ought to be, maybe lets leverage the CapabilityStatement on <code>/metadata</code>, check to see if their system supports Task, CommunicationRequest, ServiceRequest, etc; send over whatever structured data that is available, and default to a workflow that mimics paper and phonecalls and faxes when more automated options aren't available.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  I am not backing away from Task to support correction workflow and definitely not recommending CommunicationRequest as an alternative.  My point is patient portals allow patients to send free form messages to their doctors for a multitude of reasons using the Secure Messaging Function (it was required in Meaningful Use).  However, someone who uses a PHR which has data downloaded from many EHRs would need to go onto each portal to send such a message because the EHR vendors do not provide this simple communication mechanism through FHIR.  As I have been looking at corrections, its make me think of that.  So I want to know what resource or resources would be the best to send a message - like a secure email - from the patient app to the EHR - using FHIR - one that posts in that same inbox that already review from the patient portal.  My daughter constantly using this feature to send questions about weird symptoms, is she doing something wrong in her self-care, questions about directions, etc.   <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192825">@Jeffrey Danford</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192685">@Vassil Peytchev</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191356">@Jenni Syed</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="225094">@Debi Willis</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191678">@Abigail Watson</span>  (Dave I am proud of my daughter for that).</p>

<p>If the use-case we're talking about is 'send a secure message using FHIR', then yes, Communication is appropriate.  (Whether FHIR is the appropriate way to handle the 'send a secure message' use-case is a question I'll leave to the EHR vendors - I know that some environments are using it.)</p>

<p>Yes Lloyd, that was the question.  And I would say the definition of Communication is then misleading because it says "This resource is a record of a communication that has occurred. It does not represent the actual flow of communication."  What other ways could a patient communicate with their doctors outside of fhir that works in their patient app workflow?  I know direct messaging is one way but that requires patients to purchase a direct address.</p>

<p>Question for this group: would there be interest in proposing Patient Corrections as a project for Argonaut 2021? I think this would be a great fit, to get a certain set of the community to "make more room on their calendar" for discussing, testing, and iterating on specs for this use case. (On the other hand, you might decide it's a crowd or an imprimatur that you don't want.) Generally we start the project selection process toward the end of the calendar year, and if there is interest I'll be happy to include Patient Corrections on our list for review.</p>

This is a really important project because as patients begin to gather their data, there is going to be more visibility of all the errors in their charts. These errors could impact patient safety, health care choices, and insurance premiums. We really want to enable correction requests directly within the consumer apps instead of the patient printing out a form and mailing correction requests to the clinic. I also agree with Lloyd that Task will likely be used more in a variety of future use cases. Is there anything we need to do on our side to get this moving forward with Argonaut?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>    as the US pivots toward greater data sharing with the information blocking rules, patients will be seeing more information and will see it more real-time, and have more to respond to.  And I would assume that one important response will be that's not correct.    I think providing patients will the ability to respond electronically in real-time would be empowering for patients as well as help with workflow management of incoming requests on provider side.</p>

This is even more important now with Covid causing patients to communicate remotely with their healthcare providers, social workers, and researchers.</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback! I'll probably rope folks into proofreading (and of course if you like, re-writing entirely) a short project description for the Argonaut planning process.

<p>I think we all agree here that being able to send correction is a good thing, the issue is how to make that a reality: we'll figure out the technical part, it is not hard, the hard part is to have providers actually deploy it - I would love to see ideas about how to achieve that (because frankly, implementing things that would never be used  is not that fun)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191531">@Virginia Lorenzi</span> An easy way for apps to initiate direct communications to providers isn't necessarily going to be seen as a positive for a lot of providers.  Right now there are a lot of gatekeepers - and a lot of clinicians are quite happy for things to stay that way.  Also, there aren't necessarily billing codes for reading and responding to patient queries.  I'm not saying that providing a secure email-like functionality over FHIR would be a bad thing, but we'll need to think carefully about the business case from both sides of the exchange if we want it to be adopted.</p>

I love where Virginia is going with this question. This capability would bring so many benefits to patients￼. ￼I have had several people ask me if they could use FHIR for secure communication between patients and organizations.￼ They specifically referenced ￼FHIR paralleling the Direct communication between a patient and a provider but using FHIR as￼ an easier and cheaper way for patients to communicate with them within apps. This is even more important now with Covid causing patients to communicate remotely with their healthcare providers, social workers, and researchers.</p>

<p>I'm thrilled at the idea of Argonaut engagement.

<p>To be clear, this opportunity zooms instantly to the top of my interest list :-)   </p>
<p>And I agree, it would be terrific to find both a use case that providers agree is indisputably legit and worth doing, and some provider orgs who are game to take it on.  Although I often sound rabble-rousey, there is much value to be had by providers. </p>
<p>Would "missing allergy" be seen as undeniably valuable to providers?  Would it need to be more specific?</p>

<p>Fixing allergy, med, and problem lists is an easy story and feels like a great start; I think we'd still want to keep something "less strucured" front and center as well, so we don't over-fit the workflow.</p>

<p>There are LOTS of not very structured ones, but it’s easy to get into very debatable territory. </p>
<p>But how about this: remember <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="311763">@Morgan Gleason</span> ‘s winning talk at DevDays June? It included discovering that her chart suddenly said she’d had two pregnancies, and she shared the documents she had used to precisely do what HIPAA requires.

In the new EHI Draft Consumer Privacy Framework: <a href="https://www.ehidc.org/resources/draft-consumer-privacy-framework-health-data#:~:text=August%2026%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93%20Today%20the,rules%20that%20should%20govern%20them">https://www.ehidc.org/resources/draft-consumer-privacy-framework-health-data#:~:text=August%2026%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93%20Today%20the,rules%20that%20should%20govern%20them</a>., it describes the first right with respect to a consumer's health information as their right to "Access, Correct, and Delete Consumer Health Information".  Through Argonaut and CARIN's efforts there has been focus on access.  Our purpose is to address the other parts.  Also, WHO did a study on Legal Frameworks for eHealth in 2012.  It surveyed countries around the world about "rights that were granted to individuals, asking<br>
if patients had a right to seek correction and deletion elements of the record".  Sadly, this right seemed to be reserved more for individuals in wealthier countries.  The study can be found here: <a href="https://www.who.int/goe/publications/legal_framework_web.pdf">https://www.who.int/goe/publications/legal_framework_web.pdf</a>  In the upcoming Patient Corrections Track at the January Connectathon, we are hoping to have representatives from countries other than the US.</p>

<p>note that even in the USA the right is not equally distributed... those with more wealth can navigate the boundaries and  pathways necessary, where those less well off can't. Our goal is to define a more automatable process based on interoperability, so that many applications can be developed that can leverage our specification, thus more likely that the functionality is available to everyone that has the legitimate right and/or authorization.</p>

<p>It's also not clear to me why distinct profiles are provided for Task[request] and Task[disagreement].  Is the idea that one Task will fit (at least?) one of these profiles at any point in time, but it could switch between them when statuses change?

<p>Thanks. Looking at the spreadsheet, one thing I worry about is "clobbering" the <code>Task.description</code> if it's being used to support a back-and-forth conversation as a Task changes states. It feels a bit odd, since the description (unlike status reason) seems designed to be more stable through the lifecycle of a Task.</p>

<p>Part of a patient's rights (at least in the US) is to instruct the organization about who needs to be contacted concerning a correction in the chart. This is an important part of corrections so we want to address how to do that also.

<p>I think everything is still in the phase of discussion to make sure we are considering all possible impacts to a particular option.  We will dig deeper into the draft spec tomorrow. We value insight from each of you. We don't want to get bogged down, but we also don't want to miss important insight. Please show up and we can have some great minds working on this together. </p>

<p>Logic for a distinct task is that the patient is actually asking for something different - and the wording the patient wants to be recorded in the record might be different once they see the initial rejection.  As well, the data being submitted might be different.</p>

<p>You can go from received to accepted to completed.  You can go from received to received - extended to accepted to completed.  You can go from received to received-extended to rejected.  For disagreement, rebuttal adds a shade to the state transition as well.  Also, while the task is in a state, the requester could send an update.

<p>Thanks. Looking at the spreadsheet, one thing I worry about is "clobbering" the <code>Task.description</code> if it's being used to support a back-and-forth conversation as a Task changes states.

<p>About the statuses and state diagram - we met last week and decided that the "received" status was not needed - requested was enough.  I reviewed our original state diagram (which is in the draft spec now) and updated it in this powerpoint to reflect that as well as to fix an error on the Disagreement Flow.  Rebuttal is an optional state.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t1X4jn_8DTgaumaTN9hzQvVkB0LF7zFu/edit#slide=id.p4">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t1X4jn_8DTgaumaTN9hzQvVkB0LF7zFu/edit#slide=id.p4</a>  We are currently using business status but perhaps its not needed - something to think about.  Also, it is possible for a patient to cancel a correction request.  A patient could also update a correction request.  For example, when they learn their request is accepted, they might update their request to include who to notify with the corrections when they are completed (this example is from the HIPAA workflow guide).</p>

<p>CommunicationRequest might be a little heavy - depends how much information we need to convey.  In terms of whether it should be the app or the provider that does the communication, it sort of depends who will have the mechanism to connect to the target and deliver it.  It could be either side.  For those situations where the provider can do it and the app can't, including that in the request is reasonable.</p>

<p>The patient will be making the request to the provider to communicate with the people identified by the patient. The patient will not be communicating directly with the people on the list.

<p>Sure.  And if I have that provider's address is in a vCard or I'm fetching it via FHIR from Salesforce or Outlook?  Or have extracted it from my Apple HealthRecords?</p>
<p>The patient may not be communicating directly with the downstream providers, but they may have the structured data on who to contact, and be sending that info along via a FHIR Person resource (rather than a text string or narrative text).</p>

<p>Michele has a point, to the extent that Communication and CommunicationRequests are lower priority. Yet, if we're going to model the downstream communications mandated by HIPAA, then we need to include them.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191678">@Abigail Watson</span>  I am confused when you say "a transaction bundle within task.input".  I thought is would just be an array of task.input values - no need for a transaction since its in task and no need for a bundle.  Also transaction is an operation so how would you put that in the task?  Could be a limit on my FHIR knowledge here - thanks.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span></p>

<p>CommunicationRequest might be a little heavy - depends how much information we need to convey.  In terms of whether it should be the app or the provider that does the communication, it sort of depends who will have the mechanism to connect to the target and deliver it.  It could be either side.  For those situations where the provider can do it and the app can't, including that in the request is reasonable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree - that's why I had it as a free text.  However, CommunicationRequest is also an option but I think both need to be supported.</p>

<p>Hi.  ‘Transaction bundle’ is totally up for interpretation at this point and my shorthand for a few ideas.  So far, I’ve heard three main proposals... a) slicing the Task.input field, effectively making it typed, and adding resources or operation requests as an array; b) punting on the issue by putting a Bundle into Task.input, which is effectively a wildcard, or c) using Task.partOf and putting each operation request or resource into a sub-task.</p>

<p>I’m open to any/all of the above, if somebody puts the effort into putting an implementation together to test it.</p>

<p>Task.input is going to need to be sliced regardless - there are multiple inputs we'll need and the profile will need to distinguish them.  Going with sub-tasks would allow us to convey the status of each 'communication target' independently (e.g. I told Insurer A and Dr. Jones, but couldn't get hold of Insurer B and Dr. Smith isn't at that phone number any more).  Don't know if that's an essential thing to have sent discretely.  If a text blob in Task.note would suffice, then I'd avoid sub-tasks.  CommunicationRequest is tricky because if you're going to have a CommunicationRequest you need to be able to indicate what you want communicated - which is something that doesn't yet exist.  Also, technically, a CommunicationRequest is just an authorization for sharing, not a true 'request' to share.  So using it 'right' is probably going to be somewhat big and ugly.  That's why my leaning was to just use Task.input -either to list the individuals or to provide a text blob for that purpose.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192685">@Vassil Peytchev</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  there is still disagreement about the way to link disagreement to the initial request.  Vassil thinks it should go in Task.partof.  I think it should go in Task.partof or Task.basedon.  Lloyd says Task.input.  My logic - I think it is possible to do a bare bones unstructured request task with no inputs and that would be a feature for less sophisticated systems</p>

<p>Also - do we need to look inside the DomainResource fields in task and profile those at all?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192685">@Vassil Peytchev</span> The issue with putting it in Task.partOf is the state machine.  Once a Task is rejected, then defining something as 'part of' that Task or 'based on' that Task doesn't get you anywhere.  Also, 'based on' is about the chain of authorization, and we're not really talking about authorization when we say that Task B is a disagreement about information in the record that Task A was attempting to correct.  There's no 'standard' semantic in Task for that relationship, so I think you pretty much have to use either Task.input or an extension.</p>

<p>What is it in the state machine that prevents a secondary task to be partOf a previously rejected/completed Task? The main point is the "disagreement" step cannot take place without the previously rejected request, and a profile-required Task.partOf seems the obvious way to express that.</p>

<p>My understanding is that if a Task is rejected, everything that's part of it is rejected.  That's not a 'hard' rule, but it's a pretty common expectation.  Also "please flag my record as having a disagreement" isn't really part of the action "please fix this data".</p>

<p>I'm not sure that's strictly true, but even if it is "contingent on" is not the same as "part of" or "authorized by".</p>
