<p>The reality is that anything related to legislatively regulated requests will be messy. Real life example: after being rear-ended, my license plate was quite bent out of shape. I wanted to request a new set of license plates (and pay for it), but wanted to retain the existing license plate number - a random combination, but one that I was used to. Seems fairly straight forward, but the outcome was that I still have the original hammered out license plates.</p>
<p>I see this as a distraction question - not because it is not important to facilitate the messy conversations that will accompany the request for corrections, but because trying to represent messy conversations in a complete, fully specified interoperability specification will take a long time. I think helping along the conversation is not the same as making that a core part of the first draft of the Patient Corrections IG.</p>

<p>A fear I have is we will over design it with lots of resources and complex fields (coded inputs and outputs) - I am OK with the opportunity for complexity but want a low budget simple solution to start.</p>

<p>Sorry to jump into the middle of a substantial conversation. </p>
<p>I think you can break up the challenges around allowing patients to assist with medical data accuracy into a few steps (my guess below). </p>
<ol>
<li>patients need to see the data, so they can notice the errors</li>
<li>when an error is noticed, patients need to know how to communicate the error</li>
<li>providers need a way to receive the notification from patients</li>
<li>providers need to communicate the update status to patients</li>
<li>patients will need to verify the outcome (possibly negotiate with the provider and repeat the process)</li>
</ol>
<p>Technology may not be the correct solution for all of these steps, immediately at least. The process will also need to fit into the provider's workflow. This can be much different between hospital and office settings (and EHR used).</p>

<p>Thanks to all for their inputs.  I have zero opinion of what it should do - I just know two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>We (the public) NEED to enable app-automating the submission and tracking of error fixes.  We out here do not care how it gets done. It can be 99% manual OUTSIDE of the submission and tracking process. </li>
<li>I want it to get adopted, so I want it to be worth the effort for system &amp; app vendors to do.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, though non-technical, I'd again say I for one would be entirely okay with keeping our hands out of what happens outside the above.  </p>
<p>We (as a society and as individuals) do need to ensure that a truthful record of the dialog exists and can be verified.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246928">@Josh Lamb</span> Jump right in the water is warm.  I think that the difference between office setting and hospital setting is important.  In a shared medical record where multiple clinicians are responsible for your chart which is very much true for the inpatient hospital setting a mediator often plays a role - example, Health Information Management aka Medical Records.  And the error could be an IT error or admitting error, etc.  And bad data can be  buried and repeated in past visits where the treating clinician is focused on documenting/currenting the current visit.</p>

<p>How about we let patients comment against a fhir ID. Thiz would look like chat functionality and would rely upon free text, to keep things simple. The provider and patient can reply dialog directly against the data used to support decision making.</p>
<p>This should be simple to implement if the provider and patient can see the same data.</p>

<p>There's a lot of history here <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246928">@Josh Lamb</span>  :-) Overall I think it's safe to say that the scope for an initial IG is allowing corrections <em>in general</em> rather than focusing on how to correct errors in a specific FHIR resources. (E.g., errors may span many resources, or may be about aspects of a record not captured in fhir at all). If you're brave and looking for diversion <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246928">@Josh Lamb</span> you could probably spend a couple of hours scrolling backwards in this stream.</p>

<p>A separate Task for each comment is certainly possible, but seems like overkill.  If it's not <em>asking</em> for something, it's not really a 'Task' and all of the notions of status, owner, etc. wouldn't make much sense.  If we're just looking for general comments, I think Task.comment is probably enough - it captures who, when and what was said.  Do we need more than that?</p>

<p>Is the goal to build out a workflow that will allow providers and patients to collaborate on chart corrections? </p>
<p>I agree that Task is too complex for phase one..do we have a phase one defined yet?? :-)</p>
<p>The communication resource seems ideal. We can use the following fields to allow patients to comment on an FHIR resource:<br>
<strong>subject</strong>: Focus of message--The patient or person who the data is about<br>
<strong>basedOn</strong>: The data (diagnosis, procedure, lab result, etc) that the communication is about<br>
<strong>status</strong>: This can be used to communicate if the communication request is open or not. <br>
<strong>sender</strong>: Who sent the communication (can be patient, provider, etc)<br>
<strong>payload</strong>: A communication can contain multiple payloads: <br>
1.) can contain the suggested correction; <br>
2.) can contain the free text message the patient/provider wanted to communicate</p>
<p>Here is the FHIR definition of the communication resource: <br>
This resource is a record of a communication even if it is planned or has failed. A communication is a conveyance of information from one entity, a sender, to another entity, a receiver. The sender and receivers may be patients, practitioners, related persons, organizations, or devices. Communication use cases include:</p>
<p>A reminder or alert delivered to a responsible provider<br>
A recorded notification from the nurse to the on-call physician (or any other specified person) that a patient's temperature exceeds a value<br>
A notification to a public health agency of a patient presenting with a communicable disease reportable to the public health agency<br>
Patient educational material sent by a provider to a patient<br>
Unable to deliver lab results to ordering physician</p>

<p>I love workflows btw, that is why I picked this topic. We can flow all of these use cases out and make sure the resource status and constraints take everything into account. I do not think this will have to be extremely complex.</p>

<p>I started by using Task, which is in the current IG, but people are saying it is too complex. I am not sure how much of this IG is up for debate. We can make task or communication work.</p>

<p>Communication doesn't give a good way of querying for 'current state' - it's really just taking emails to a provider and sending them over FHIR.</p>

<p>Patients can view that the correction has occurred by checking the source data again. Since the Patient Access API is the consumer-directed FHIR interface I am assuming the data originally was pulled from this API. </p>
<p>Health insurance providers, labs, and hospitals will not have a mechanism to accept inbound communications from a consumer device. I am not sure how the corrections will physically make it to the data producers system.</p>

<p>I do not have a strong opinion on the FHIR resources used, but the options seem limited to communication requests/responses within a task. What other option do you have? I do not think that Payers and providers will universally begin accepting FHIR messaging communications. We have a patient access API, and we will have to modify it to accept inbound communications at some point anyway. </p>

<p>My leaning is, in the short term, to support Task only.  Any back-and-forth communication is done just using Task.note.  If, in the future, we want to support a "secure email equivalent" that could point to Task (or other things), that could certainly be built on top if it were deemed useful.</p>

<p>The communication statuses imply a workflow sequence. We will need to define our own statues sequence and limit the available options to the list of values we use in our workflow. We may want to remove some of teh options that are not final. For example, all of the following statues indicate some flavor of "not-complete": preparation | in-progress | not-done | on-hold | stopped | unknown</p>
<p>Here is a technical suggestion to perform the searches: <br>
To Get data for all patients, if the status is 'not-done'<br>
GET [base]/Communication?recipient=Provider/123&amp;Status='not-done' (or the desired status)</p>
<p>To Get data for one patient, if the status is 'not-done'<br>
GET [base]/Communication?subject=Patient/456789&amp;Status='not-done' (or the desired status)</p>
<p>A patient can get the status by: <br>
GET [base]/Communication?subject=Patient/456789&amp;Status='not-done' (or the desired status)</p>
<p>Everyone can get a Communication by:<br>
GET [base]/Communication/123</p>

<p>I have zero concerns about accidental overwrite - because you can guarantee that the system performing the update has the current record before they're allowed to make a change.  It's certainly possible for them to deliberately delete data, but our specification can (and should) set expectations about the server prohibiting changes that we deem improper.  (We'll have to explore what happens if a note is submitted that legitimately does need to be deleted - e.g. because someone said something inappropriate or disclosed data that shouldn't have been shared - though that will require a deeper cleaning than a mere update because the data might still be accessible through history.)</p>

<p>Communication is used to log the exchange of data.  If you've mailed a letter, you know that communication has been started, but you don't know yet that it's been received.  Communication can also be an ongoing process - e.g. "Share the the patients vital signs with organization X for the duration of the encounter".  I agree that for many uses, Communication.status will be only 'completed'.  The other statuses are there for those situations when they make sense.  But the statuses reflect the status of the <em>communication</em>, not anything else.</p>

<p>Catching up on some backlog.  </p>
<p>My general $0.02 from the provider side on fielding these requests and being responsible for making the correction, is that the overall conversation is under-appreciating the role that the PDF document server has (and by extension, DocumentReference).  When we talk about the healthcare industry propping up the FAX industry, keep in mind that a FAX can be hooked up to a PDF printer.  So FAX messages can be routed directly to the PDF server.  Anything paper or FAX related is effectively managed by a DocumentReference ID, and that includes any workflow that can be expressed as a series of pages of paper.  So a Morgan Gleason letter.  A medical malpractice subpoena.  An IRB investigation.  Or a verbal phonecall that is written down on a notepad.  All can be expressed and tracked via a PDF document server.  Workflow sucks and people complain about click count because it's not optimized for their particular workflow, but most any employee can learn it with training and willingness to click through a bunch of menus and link the appropriate documents together.  </p>
<p>Generally speaking, errors occur in a power law distribution.  Meaning that there are some types of errors, such as left/right errors and wrong-patient errors, that are orders of magnitude more common than other errors.   Administrative errors such as dictating on the wrong patient can often be resolved by a manager without needing clinician co-signature.  Upcoding is a bit more complicated, and depends on whether it was billing or clinical who did the upcoding on whether the manager can correct.  An error that's truly clinical (including left/right) gets complicated, because then it's no longer an issue of the patient's record, but of the practitioner's reputation and license at stake.  So there has to be clinician sign-off on the correction.</p>
<p>In practice, the requests for error corrections come in all forms.  Post-it note is extremely common format within a department, especially among the help desks before/after they get converted into the ticket management system.  Fax, emails, and certified mail are preferred and generally the official ways to communicate with a department.  In person verbal complaints and phone calls also generally have to be supported (although its common for some workers to want as little to do with patients as possible, and they hide/sequester themselves).   Sometimes the patients drop off the incorrect errors, and will deliver a CD or thumbdrive with the incorrect data or corrected data or a second opinion.  Obviously, it becomes extra difficult when the patient speaks a foreign language (I've had to field requests in sign language, yiddish, spanish, and other languages.).  Interdepartmental correction requests obviously have an extra layer of difficulty, when data is stored in an ancillary system that medical records doesn't have control of.  That's when a manager or patient advocate is needed to follow up on the case; more so if it's inter-hospital or is historical (greater than 90 days, 1 year, 7 years, 17 years).  </p>
<p>What the Task resource is really trying to do (imho), is replace/standardize the ticket management systems, not the EHR.</p>

<p>I love that analogy.  I completely agree that Task is essentially a FHIR interface over a ticket management system.  It gives an ability to submit the ticket, add comments to it and monitor its progress.  The question of whether to handle submission by phone, email,  "FHIR email" (aka Communication), or "FHIR Fax" (aka DocumentReference) vs. Task really boils down to whether we're just trying to provide a mechanism to automate initial delivery of the raw data for the request that someone will later key into a 'private' ticket management system, or whether provider organizations are willing to open the interface to the ticket management to allow a patient to fill it out directly and monitor the ticket as it flows through the system.  (Thereby significantly reducing the various phone calls, emails, etc. from patient's wanting to know the 'status' of their request, as well as eliminating all of the re-keying of the requests themselves and many of the subsequent back-and-forth communications.)</p>
<p>When an organization opens up their ticket management system to allow direct submission of tickets from "customers", there's a trade-off.  Trained help-desk personnel typically know how to fill out tickets better than customers do and can also solicit information they know will be needed downstream, while the clients might not provide it initially.  And there's still a help-desk function of performing initial triage.  However, if the client-facing ticket interface is well designed, switching to a client-facing model can save resources and also significantly improve satisfaction (provided that insight into why a ticket is stalled results in insight/acceptance rather than frustration).</p>

<p>I don't disagree. The Task as we are describing it is just an interface. I however think that we are over-engineering it to the point that our solution will be seen as overly complex and requiring too many internal process changes. I simply favor an approach where we start with something minimally viable and work toward Task in future generations.</p>

<p>Minimally viable is "phone your provider".   There are three possible objectives for our initiative:</p>
<ol>
<li>Standardized 'entry point' to kick off the process (so an app can do the kick-off regardless of system, provided it knows the base URL for that system)</li>
<li>Support the flow of back-and-forth communication that tends to occur as a result of the request in a 'secure' way.  (This could be just providing secure communication in general.)</li>
<li>Allow patients to monitor the progress of their request and make certain updates to the request as it progresses</li>

<p>There's a subset of (3) that I think is useful and practical: monitor whether the request has been completed (and when). This allows patients to know when deadlines aren't being met and escalate out of band, even if there's no in-band mechanism to "make certain updates".</p>

<p>If you want the ability to formally describe, distinguish and act upon the different outcomes of a request for corrections, you are stating that monitoring the progress of the correction request is the highest priority. If that is not the case, then this effort becomes to define a general solution for patient-provider communications in FHIR - which is very valuable and important, but a very different type of effort.</p>

<p>If you think of the way it is done now with letters, faxes, and phone calls...there is no monitoring of the progress of the request. The most important aspect of this process is the conversation...the ability for each party to understand each other and share important information (which may take multiple threads). When it was recommended we try Task, we had the added bonus of monitoring a request. But, monitoring the progress was not the real focus. And with task, we really don't have an accurate view of the status of the request because we will likely have multiple changes requested by the patient but only one task status. </p>
<p>When looking at what we are trying to accomplish, we should not elevate the ability to monitor the task over the ability to have a secure conversation and sharing of files, images, etc. If we had to "score" the different resources to determine which is best, the criteria (in order of importance) would be: 1) bi-directional communication 2) sharing of files 3) monitoring task progress (optional).  If you review the HIPAA guidelines (which is what the clinics must follow), there is no requirement for the patient to be able to monitor the task progress within the clinic but there are many pieces of information that are required to be communicated to the patient throughout the process. We are trying to build a secure FHIR-based model to duplicate the HIPAA implementation specification.  It think somewhere along the road the monitoring of the task became a "must" when it never should have been interpreted that way.</p>

<p>I think I am not explaining this clearly - "monitoring of the progress" doesn't mean a view into the internal process of handling the request. </p>
<p>What I am trying to explain is that the ability to describe, distinguish, and act upon the different outcomes of a request (i.e. approved, denied, partially approved) is what I mean by "monitoring of the progress". Just that one thing - using FHIR to submit a request for corrections, and to understand that at some specific point (after possibly many other interactions between the patient and the responsible entity) the request has been approved, partially approved, or denied.</p>
<p>Is the above considered optional?</p>

<p>Put another way, are we comfortable with passing arbitrary blobs of text back and forth with no 'discrete' elements to support automation.  I.e. you can type whatever you like whenever you like, no constraints based on where you're at in the 'lifecycle' of the request.  Essentially, just a FHIR interface for arbitrary email.</p>

<p>Yes, monitoring the request is not a view into the internal process of handling the request. That is outside of our scope (as it should be). But, if the ability to monitor the task is thought to be that important, the problem that several requests could be included within a single task and may have different outcomes is not solved with task. In cases like this (which may be most cases), the benefit of the task status is diminished because it cannot accurately describe all the outcomes of the requests. </p>
<p>My understanding is there is the ability to have discrete elements in Communication with payload. Is that an accurate understanding?  </p>
<p>There is also a status with Communication (preparation | in-progress | not-done | on-hold | stopped | completed | entered-in-error | unknown) that is being overlooked in the Zulip conversation. </p>
<p>The request for corrections could be coded to distinguish it from other communications coming in. Just like in the Epic portal. The user is allowed to pick a topic. </p>
<p>The consumer app would be able to link the specific conversation IDs together in the UI. They would not be arbitrary blobs of text. </p>
<p>Again, I am not saying we need to throw out Task as an option. I am simply bringing the focus back to the most important needs.</p>

<p>Not really, no.  Communication allows you to say "send this lab report, this consult note and these vitals", but it's all just "send stuff".  There's no ability to assign distinct meaning to any content other than what's already intrinsic to the content.  You can't send 3 lab reports and computably designate one of them as "baseline" and the other two as "for comparison".  (Though you could send a text note that said "I'm sending you a baseline and 2 others for comparison" and a human would presumably be able to figure out which was which based on dates.)</p>
<p>So, in our use-case, you can't have separate elements called "reason for change" or "details of change" or "notice of disagreement" - unless you decided to transmit a resource that captured that content as discrete - which may tie into <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span>'s proposal to use QuestionnaireResponse.  You could attach a single QuestionnaireResponse to a Communication and have discrete data within that.</p>

<p>Task.input is a name/value pair.  You specify a code that indicates the meaning of the input, an then specify the value of the input (which could be anything at all).  With Communication, you can send send strings, attachments or references to resources, and you can't "name" them with a code.  So all content sent is undifferentiated except by data type.  (It's not allowed to assign meaning to the order in which the payload repetitions appear.)  You can certainly send a CCD or image either way, but only with Task can you computably say what's to be done with it.  Task also lets you send codes, integers, dates, ranges - any data type you wish.  As an example, Task would let you communicate a date that a change needs to be applied by as a discrete computable element (that might drive prioritization within the target health system).  With Communication, the date would need to be part of the body of string or PDF (or maybe in a QuestionnaireResponse, assuming the receiver knows how to do something computable with that).</p>
<p>The gist of Task is "please do".  The gist of Communication is "for your reading pleasure".<br>
<strong>preparation</strong>: I'm getting ready to share this information with recipients<br>
<strong>in-progress</strong>: I'm the process of sharing information with recipients (we'd probably make this a fixed value if we use Communication)<br>
<strong>not-done</strong>: I chose not to share this information with the specified recipients<br>
<strong>on-hold</strong>: I started to share this information with recipients, but have temporarily quit<br>
<strong>stopped</strong>: I started to share this information with recipients, but have permanently quit<br>
<strong>completed</strong>: The specified information has been delivered to the specified recipients.  In theory, the recipient could update the Communication received to 'completed' to say that it had actually been read by all recipients.  Completed has nothing to do with any action other than "we read what was sent".  Completed would also be the status of any Communications recorded retrospectively (notes about phone calls, faxes, external emails) that should be part of the record.<br>
<strong>entered-in-error</strong>: This instance describes something that never happened, but someone may have acted on the belief that it did<br>
<strong>unknown</strong>: My system has no idea whether the communication happened or not - primarily for exposing legacy data</p>

<p>The request for corrections could be coded to distinguish it from other communications coming in. Just like in the Epic portal. The user is allowed to pick a topic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there may be a confusion between what the patient-facing user interface is, vs. what the FHIR interface to the responsible entity is. Of course, for the patient it makes most sense if the user interface is familiar, as in any other patient-provider communications. This has very little to do with the shape of the FHIR interface exposed by the EHR. In the Epic patient portal example, the patient messages end up in many different places in the EHR,  based on the topic/purpose of the message. None of them are currently exposed as Communication resources.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192685">@Vassil Peytchev</span> How are they currently exposed (if exposed at all)?</p>

<p>Patient/provider messages are not exposed as FHIR resources. The outcome of certain types (e.g. a MedicationRequest for refill requests) would be exposed.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to create illustrative mockups of each scenario being described prior to our next meeting?  I'm thinking the old adage "a picture is worth a thousand words" might help all of us better understand all the options.</p>

<p>Thats a good idea Bart.  It might be good to reduce the options somewhat first because there seems to be redundancy.</p>
