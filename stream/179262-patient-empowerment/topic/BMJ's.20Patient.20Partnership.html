<p>As I've mentioned, in 2014 the BMJ (nee British Medical Journal) initiated a Patient Advisory Panel, which interacts regularly with the editors. Further, the panel is part of a larger patient-public partnership, which includes the remarkable requirement that the authors of research articles must state how they involved patients in the design &amp; conduct of the study!</p>
<p>So what we're doing is far from unprecedented. :-)</p>
