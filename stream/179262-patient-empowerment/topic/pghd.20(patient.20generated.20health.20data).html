<p>In our discussions in Atlanta, we've been talking alot about patient generated health data (which the government calls PGHD_.  In the US, there is a proposed regulation referred to as the PFS 2020 proposed reg and comments are being accepted until 9/27/19.  In it is an RFI on PGHD.  Simply search for PGHD in the rule.  I would argue that patient corrections could be considered PGHD.  There is also an RFI about EHR safety.  If anyone wants to read the regulation it can be found here: <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/14/2019-16041/medicare-program-cy-2020-revisions-to-payment-policies-under-the-physician-fee-schedule-and-other" target="_blank" title="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/14/2019-16041/medicare-program-cy-2020-revisions-to-payment-policies-under-the-physician-fee-schedule-and-other">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/14/2019-16041/medicare-program-cy-2020-revisions-to-payment-policies-under-the-physician-fee-schedule-and-other</a><br>
If you want to comment on it here is how: n commenting, please refer to file code CMS-1715-P. Because of staff and resource limitations, we cannot accept comments by facsimile (FAX) transmission.</p>

<p>I know some of the pioneers who first proposed "PGHD" a decade ago, and this is definitely not what they meant ... their intent was to bang on the heads of people who think the only relevant data points arise from clinicians.  So I think your point on EHR Safety will have infinitely more leverage.</p>
