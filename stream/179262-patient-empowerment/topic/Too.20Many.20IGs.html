<p>There are too many IGs being developed to empower patients. We are using technical standards to limit behaviors. The model we are pulling data from is already standardized. We can use that model and allow application developers, consumers, and providers much greater freedom.</p>

<p>Does this make sense? </p>
<p>An application that can receive access from a consumer will be limited if it can only access use case specific functionality. </p>
<p>Instead use cases can emerge organically. Patients and providers should be able to choose how an application functions (and how to use their data). </p>
<p>Use case specific IGs seem to slow innovation. We can standardize on the patient and allow apps to meet use cases. I am not sure why we are trying to dictate standards around how data is used. Business agreements and consent should determine how data is used.</p>

<p>What specifically are you arguing against? The key implementation guides we have are not use case specific; SMART on FHIR provides a general authorization and integration method; US Core and CARIN BB together ensure access to two key data sets, with no specific use case limitations imposed. Of course the implementation guides each cover a certain technical scope, and there are some things you can build on top of this scope and other things you cannot (as a simple example, the CARIN BB implementation guide supports read access but some use cases require writing).</p>

<p>CARIN and USCore are good examples of IGs that attempt to establish a minimum acceptable version of a resource. As things currently stand, all profiles sent to the consimer are in alignment.  These IGs are also largely silent on how the data mist be used. This enables use cases to emerge. </p>
<p>An IG that says exactly how two parties must exchange data, and what fields to use may help with interoperability but I do not think we are ready. We should see how people use the data first. </p>
<p>We suggested a simple IG that allows the patient access api to accept task updates from patients and providers. This could be powerful in the hands of a clever developer.</p>

<p>Even for the suggested IG that includes task updates, it seems we were getting caught up in the specifics of how it would be used. I can think of numerous ways to use tasks but I would hesitate to provide implementation directions. Instead, I would like to see applications emerge that can take advantage of this capability (and hopefully the easy implementation and inclusion in the patient access API will increase adoption too). </p>
<p>I think that app developers if given some freedom, can develop use cases too. </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191912">@Michele Mottini</span> what do you think as an app dev? Use case-specific IGs vs higher freedom (and consumer choice)?</p>

<p>If we focus on core functionality (complete data, how to trust, how to exchange) app devs can be leveraged to solve problems. Instead of using an IG to tell us how things will function, I trust that an app can eventually come along that people can agree to trust to perform some meaningful interactions. I do not see the need to trust the IG.</p>
<p>Again, this is specific to use-case specific IGs.</p>

<p>IGs that specify subsets are setting minimums, they're not prohibiting other information from being shared.   Certainly, you can expect certain systems will only do the minimum of what regulation-referenced IGs demand.  However, the reality is that if those IGs didn't exist, the systems probably wouldn't share anything at all.  Every IG has an underlying use-case or set of use-cases.  As much as possible, we try to make sure that the IGs leverage the same interfaces and approaches, allowing re-use.  Also, once the interfaces exist, extending them to support additional data elements - either demanded by other IGs or just because some of the sharing parties mutually find them useful should be easy to do.  In general, FHIR takes the approach of "build simple useful things first and make it easy for them to grow and support new use-cases not initially contemplated" rather than "ask people to build global interfaces that support everything" - to which the typical reaction is "too expensive, no business case, no thanks".</p>

<p>I am proposing that an app can be owned by a provider and used by a consumer. This enables more powerful interactions to occur (and removes the need to define interactions between the front end and backend, since one app owns both).</p>

<p>Keep in mind that even if the FHIR interface is "store a Task", that doesn't mean that from a back-end perspective the data always ends up in a generic store (or even the same store).  As an example, a system might expose an Observation endpoint, but only support vitals but not labs or vice versa (even though its internal data store contains both).  Asking for systems to expose a 'generic' Task endpoint may be exceedingly hard to realize in practice.  IGs with tightly defined scopes are easier to embark on.</p>

<p>The IG i am proposing will not work well if we have two apps trying to communicate (without an IG for guidance). </p>
<p>If a provider trusted an app, and the app found a cool way to utilize fields on the Task to perform meaningful interactions (that are controlled on both ends by app and data) I can see possibilities emerging without strict guidance.</p>

<p>IGs should not prohibit behavior unless it's clearly wrong in the use-case.  (So, for example, constraining max cardinalities is something that should be done only with considerable caution.)</p>

<p>There are open discussions about creating IGs that remove fields (set max cardinality to 0) but these have not made it past the idea stage and do not think they will gain momentum. </p>
<p>For PE, I am worried about use-case specific workflow IGs being too restrictive, for day one. We are essentially defining a sequence of Task states that must be followed to achieve an outcome. For the first IG, I think we can allow Devs to define how to interact with the Task. </p>
<p>The IG should also avoid assigning actions to the data producers based upon the Task states (e.g. if the Task status is "x" you must do "y").</p>

<p>One possibility: you're overestimating drastically how well servers (EHRs) support Task or similar data structures today. Most inherently lack that concept (or have many user specific workqueues), so it's a big lift to implement, given how it spans  a lot of ground. Perhaps that restriction is the tension of compromise between your desires (thinking from a creator/developer/app perspective) vs those other stakeholders.</p>

<p>This is a serious problem - patients want their information corrected.  Incorrect data impacts quality, safety, cost, and research for a better tomorrow. <br>
 And interoperability makes it worse because we spread the wrong data.  And patients want to be heard - this provides a voice.  They also just want their information and often times they want information not available on APIs and wont be for awhile.  There are other patient requests like for appointment and refills or a callback from the doctor or just a question.  So for example another use case could be patient request for release of information. <br>
 So we need to find a solution for patient corrections.  I feel that there is functionality that will need to be developed on the server side, not just the API.  EHRs are all about workflow.  Orders of all types, med admin request, med supply requests, transfer order, pt order, order for diagnostic service, order for chaplain visit, request for use of a room, orders for a wheelchair, order for a room to be cleaned, release of information request, etc. It is my opinion that with the new information blocking rule, we can expect the request for data in electronic format to increase as well as requests for corrections.  I do think that if we design this right, the same Task functionality could be used for other requests.  We accomplished alot of work on this this week at the WGM and I refer you to the minutes for some of the design discussions.  I will start a new thread in a little bit pointing out where you can find it also always appreciate the feedback</p>

<p>As far as too many or too few IGs I was very tempted to say how about just right?  That is the art of interoperability standards and that friction will always exists and we always have to think about rightsizing.    I think a problem in the FHIR space is that an IG does not map to a server's capabilities.  In V2 or messaging interfaces, you would have a messaging specification and you would implement those messages on that feed.  With a server, you have end points for resources and I believe layered into how those endpoints are implemented is guidance from a multitude of IGs.  It could be just one big IG and that would certainly make it easier to find.  But IG work is use case and community driven so the work isnt done that way.  We had this problem with CDA.  Lots of people created different templates and IGs for CDA and finally someone created CCDA which through a whole bunch of them together so people could at least find them all which is why that document is huge and unweildy (I hope the CDA folk out there do not kill me for my description here and they can correct me).  We might, with FHIR, be heading for that same place.  However, we have that experience so we can look for it and address it.</p>

<p>To level-set on my goals (I promise they align with this groups): </p>
<p>1.) To develop a patient empowerment specification that can eventually be incorporated into policy.<br>
2.) To empower patients and providers to interact, in a consistent manner, regardless of the EHR used. <br>
3.) To allow patients and providers to maintain freedom of choice to choose how they interact with their health data<br>
4.) To leverage the application developer community to help solve the problems facing the healthcare ecosystem<br>
5.) To enable the transfer of information between payer and provider. </p>
<p>A generic task can meet all of the use cases specified. I posted a diagram earlier that details this process. The trick is to get an application developed and to enable economy of scale—the more, the merrier, for many reasons.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246928">@Josh Lamb</span> I will go back and review your picture.  The problems we have unearthed this week were generic I believe.  Have you been looked at #workflow as well?  I think that we need to look at it as an external request.  Requests are only that - requests.  If you order me to clean my room that doesn't mean I will do it or that I will do it how you want me to or when you want me to and I may have lots of questions about what exactly you mean by room cleaning.  We should be doing this on #workflow.  I hear FHIR I has Tuesday Workflow calls.</p>

<p>I think a "patient empowerment" specification is way too generic a concept to ever see implementation.  Start small and design to allow to expand.  If you design too big, nothing happens.  The reality is that right now, there are <em>no</em> interfaces to allow patients to initiate requests.  Each interface that gets enabled will have to be specifically enabled by the EHRs.  And each interface may well talk to a different system (even if from an external patient perspective it may seem to be the same black box).  Some IGs involve freedom to choose.  Others nail things down to ensure interoperability and to make the 'ask' small enough that there's a decent chance of it being built.  Keep in mind that there's no "generic Task" on the EHR side and there probably won't ever be.  Just as there's no "generic Observation".  Labs, vitals, smoking, etc. are all completely different back-end systems, that just happen to all be surfaced using the same FHIR resource.</p>

<p>I'm not understanding.  How the EHR handles the Task, how it transitions states, etc. is up to it.  But we definitely need to define that it has to accept POST and perhaps PUT and search.</p>

<p>We were requiring the server/EHR to take action. As <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191531">@Virginia Lorenzi</span> said, we can separate the request, fulfillment, and repository(server). A profile that the server cannot touch (unless they take on the fulfiller role) will ease the implementation burden and allow third-parties to develop apps to meet the PE use cases without involvement from EHRs. This also allows for a single app to meet a wider range of needs (more users and a wider range of functionality).</p>

<p>We're requiring <em>people</em> to take action - and we're expecting some component of the EHR to expose the request to the right people.  The reality is that EHRs aren't monolithic and there are multiple pieces of software that hospitals and clinics use - and the one used to manage interactions with patients (including logging requests for change) might not be the same as the ones used to store the clinical data that needs correcting.  However, I'd be cautious about suggesting that introducing a third-party is going to make things easier.  Our fundamental objective is to get information in front of the individuals that are responsible for resolving correction requests.  The organizations responsible for managing software in those organizations are going to be a whole lot happier and are more likely to adopt if the functionality shows up in their existing solutions than if they have to use something external.  Keep in mind that there's no regulation here that requires organizations to change from their existing paper-based processes,  Requiring installation of some new set of software (whether app or not) and forcing reliance on some uncontrolled intermediary doesn't seem like a winner to me...</p>

<p>A large EHR may develop their own apps (and implement the use cases this group will define) themselves. The EHR can also meet many use cases without an IG (which they do readily). Currently, third-party apps can ONLY meet use cases through an IG, and they cannot innovate.

<p>I don't know what you mean by 'consumer'.  If we're talking employees of a health system, they don't have "choice" - they use what their organization dictates/permits.  And the functionality needed on the patient correction side is for integration with EHR software to support making corrections, linking to the data corrected, propagating "notices of disagreement" into the record, etc.  What is the evidence for the belief that this will work better with 3rd party apps or be more likely to be adopted by healthcare organizations in third party apps than if the features are directly supported by the EHR?  Note that choice by patients isn't relevant here.  There can be all kinds of apps for them.  The question is what's going to run inside the healthcare organizations.</p>

<p>It's not about what "we" allow.  It's a question of how the market works.  Typically, individual care providers are not in charge of making those decisions.  Exactly how things work vary from country to country.  If we're going to define interoperability solutions (which is HL7's role), we need to take into account how the market dynamics function in the environments where we need adoption.  In general, we don't define solutions that are predicated on any significant change to market dynamics - because that isn't typically very productive.  It's not like we have much in the way of leverage...</p>

<p>We can create an applicatino today, without the EHRs blessing, and use the consumer's right of access to view healthcare information and to use that information to communicate between patient and provider. Again, this can be done today, but no one is. So the worries you are putting forward may not be warranted. The ability to save data to a FHIR server is needed regardless of the approach taken. I am not yet convinced that allowing an option for a "no-op" from a server somehow increases complexity, risk, or burdens EHRs anymore than a use case driven model. Use case-specific patient correction models will need a model to derive from anyway, to ensure alignment.</p>

<p>How does a right to <em>view</em> information provide any mechanism to enable communication between patient and provider?  That only builds a read-only interface and doesn't drive any change in what providers can see.  Keep in mind too, that we can't <em>make</em> servers do anything.  There has to be a business case for both the software vendor and for the customers who purchase those solutions.  The biggest question for us is "how do we interact with the healthcare professionals who control health record corrections?"  By and large, those users are restricted to using EHRs or other systems specifically approved by their organizations.  Saying "we'd like there to be choice" doesn't change that dynamic.</p>

<p>There are no "product owners" - there are specific stakeholders that realistically need to be engaged to get to a solution.  Some are easier to engage,  some harder.

<p>An IG that can apply to all sources is more attractive to me. For example, a task that will result in a patient identifier being added to the patient resource seems like it would have universal value. This would allow a consumer to begin building connections between their data sources. I see the PASS ID as a great candidate for this task.</p>

<p>But if the back-end processing is going to be completely different for different tasks, it's not going to be possible for systems to comply with a generic IG.  Also, there's a need to nail down what the Task.code values are, what the Task.input and Task.output values are, etc.  Sure, you can have a system that knows how to store and permit search on arbitrary Tasks - no need for an IG at all for that, as the FHIR core spec covers what's needed.  But as soon as you need to mandate support for certain elements and constrain the terminology to enable a specific use-case to function interoperably, you need an IG to establish those rules - and the rules are use-case specific.  For some systems, the incremental add of a new Task.code and a few new input or output types will be minor because it's just a small extension of existing capability.  For others, it represents a major set of work because it involves routing data to a completely different sub-system and a whole new set of mapping.</p>

<p>I agree, a use case-specific IG, like adding/updating a custom patient identifier, will require interaction with the source data.

<p>Regarding a generic IG, good points about the maintenance challenges. Can we allow the servers to omit terminology validation for this generic task? <br>
A principal component of this approach is that the server is unaware of the meaning of the task, or its contents. The server would probably not allow an application to register for this use case until this information is known. It may create an option for innovation to occur though.</p>
<p>If we had a generic Task 1 year ago that was part of the Patient Access API a single application could have been universally used to coordinate COVID tests and vaccines. I can flow this use case out if it's useful.</p>

<p>It's not about terminology validation, it's about agreement on how to interoperate.  If I send code X, I expect you to do Y.  That needs to be nailed down if we're going to get interoperability.  Saying "If I send you codes, I expect you to do 'stuff'" isn't something anyone can meaningfully implement.  We don't expect all back-end systems to have a 'generic' place to store these.  They need to know what the requests can correspond to so they know the place (places) to map to in their system.  If the system is unaware of the meaning of the Task, what subsystem do they route it to?  What table to they stick it in?  If back-end systems don't support "generic" Tasks, we can't have an IG that demands that they do - at least not if we want a hope of implementation.</p>

<p>It's not always a given that an intermediary is a non-starter, but that pattern requires a business model for the intermediary.  Who pays them?  Is there a reason someone would want to pay them (and do so for a sufficiently long period of time to justify setup)?  Is there trust in the intermediary by both sender and receiver?  Is there one intermediary or can there be more than one?  If one, can they operate such that they can talk to all possible senders and receivers?  If more than one, who decides what intermediary contains what stuff - and is the complexity of senders and receivers needing to support talking to multiple intermediaries worth it?</p>
<p>Typically, intermediaries work best for registry type stuff (providers, organizations, drugs, etc.), and even there only if there's a 'sponsor'.  I have trouble visualizing it being successful in this space.</p>

<p>Correct, the business use cases would need to be justified, or this would be dormant functionality. I saw an opportunity to track vaccines and to provide a consistent way for consumers to place requests (a HHS portal, for example, could have met this use case). Sometimes we have people available to solve a problem and the technology is lagging behind. I see these cases as opportunities to go app first, instead of use case first.</p>

<p>Given that implementation is use-case driven, not general capacity driven, that's challenging.  FHIR provides a façade that may make lots of functionality <em>appear</em> to be the same.  But the back-end code is frequently quite different.</p>

<p>Thanks for that insight <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>. When the use case is not defined, it is beneficial to think of all implementations as a facade. What happens below the interface (including outcomes) is a black box.  Humans, acting upon directions received through an app of their choice, are required to bridge the gap between a third-party app and the underlying data. A standard interface (facade) can provide a consistent read-only view of the status of things. A vaccine for a person can be verified through the standard "facade" search for claims and clinical data. Same is true for a read-only view of a condition (covid) or a observation (antibodies). At the end of the day, if you send a task, and someone gets a vaccine, do you really have to know the mechanics (every single time)?</p>

<p>You're presuming the existence of intermediaries that don't exist, and for which there's no business case.  You're also assuming providers will be able to choose which apps they get to run, which isn't necessarily the case either.  Also, apps (if you're talking about SMART apps) only run when launched, which isn't going to satisfy workflows where there's a need to push information in front of providers.</p>

<p>To close this thread out, I have a new thread in argonaut addressing the importance for the Patient Access API to accept a federated patient identifier (from HIPAA connections).

<p>It might be 'desirable', but not sure we can say it's "important".  Right now the requirement is that each hospital/provider have an ability to authenticate the patient and allow access to their data from that provider.  Most, if not all, systems now have that (and those that don't are either going to have it soon or face penalties).  Having a federated identifier isn't essential to making that happen - and for it to work, all of the various hospitals and clinics would need to agree to trust it and have the necessary legal paperwork in place with the identification authority to allow that to happen.  Not sure it's realistic to expect that anytime soon.</p>

<p>FHIR Patient.identifier is not an authentication mechanism. It is just an identifier. A system that mints an Open-ID-Connect authentication token when given simply a Patient identifier would be a horrible idea for real-patients, and a money-maker for the black-market. As Lloyd points out, this is about Identity assurance and authentication assurance. See NIST 800-63 for discussion. This is not special in healthcare, but is special in that failures expose data that is highly sensitive, can't be revoked and re-issued, and can be deadly for the patient, family, and care-givers. Healthcare must build upon general-IT, I fully support Open-ID-Connect. But the identity proofing and authentication strength are still the most important aspects.</p>

<p>HIPAA covered entities create identifiers not random apps. They can produce a federated ID (trust relationship).</p>

<p>but it is an identifier. it is not an authentication statement / assertion / token.   Creating identifiers is easy, and Patient.identifier can hold an infinite number of them.</p>

<p>The patient's connection is not used for B2B since the consumer will not be able to engage. The ID is proof on the requesting side and payer/provider apps enable meaningful use under HIPAA. The consumer's device can not directly exchange data for B2B. In cases where a patient requests data from another data producer we do not require them to login and the connection used between businesses does not require engagement.</p>

<p>The context of B2B provides the identity proofing and context of the meaning of the identity. This is quite common. There are plenty of models for cross-referencing one business identifier for a patient with another businesses identifier for the same patient. For example IHE has a family of these implementation guides that give the same use-cases and define how to manage patient identity cross-references when the technology layer is HL7 v2, HL7 v3, or HL7 FHIR; and companion implementation guides for query against demographics. <br>
