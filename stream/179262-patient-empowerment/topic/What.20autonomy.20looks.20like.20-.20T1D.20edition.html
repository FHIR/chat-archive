<p>I just ran across this 2016 post from the #OpenAPS movement. <br>
<a href="https://participatorymedicine.org/epatients/2016/06/its-not-about-the-car-its-about-the-drive.html" target="_blank" title="https://participatorymedicine.org/epatients/2016/06/its-not-about-the-car-its-about-the-drive.html">“It’s not about the car – it’s about the drive.” #OpenAPS standing ovation for Mark Wilson.</a></p>
<p>It's a (sorry, but) <em>brilliant</em> description of patient experience. If you wonder about this "patient experience" stuff and you don't know what life is like with Type 1 diabetes, you gotta spend 31 minutes watching this. THEN you'll get why patient data access can be transformational.</p>
<p>Check out this metaphor - each of us is chained to our "car" (our body) for live. and if you have T1D, you spend GOBS of time monitoring the dashboard - and SOMEtimes you get to look ahead and enjoy life. A multi-pane screen capture from the talk's video:<br>

<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/10155/W8W1x1x6W0DbEiS-6SlDW6gR/pasted_image.png" target="_blank" title="pasted image"><img src="/user_uploads/10155/W8W1x1x6W0DbEiS-6SlDW6gR/pasted_image.png"></a></div><p>Also the OpenAPS people are like TOTAL believers in open source, because of the "all bugs are shallow" thing, re the software that's managing their survival.</p>
<p>Also they are totally fed up the irony of "better trained" "better credentialed" people thinking they know better than what the OpenAPS people are <em>actually doing.</em></p>
<p>Autonomy is the ability to make one's own decisions about where to go in life. OpenAPS is the first massive transformation of this in a disease community.</p>

<p>Similarly, the famed ICD (implanted cardioverter / defibrillator) patient Hugo Campos expressed it this way in 2016: "I don't <em>want</em> to engage in my health. I want to engage in my <em>life</em>."  Just brilliant.</p>

<p>Apologies for the late reply <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span> – I've been getting catching up to all the great threads :)</p>
<p>I started participating in the #wearenotwaiting community in 2016 but wasn't at that DData event. It was a wonderful video to watch.</p>
