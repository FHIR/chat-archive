<p>Branching off <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191678">@Abigail Watson</span> in the "Self-Tracking Worksheet" thread - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kvetch: I wish we could spend Thursday conference call meetings talking about topics like this, instead of rehashing the charter (yet again).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who says we can't?  (Honest question)  If we suspended everything else, who would complain?  These are emergency times, as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191531">@Virginia Lorenzi</span> related from her front-line experience at NY Presbyterian.  Nurses working without masks??? OMG!</p>
<p>Also, I imagine we're free to create an alternate call for anyone who wants to spend an hour on that instead of the usual one.  Thank you for speaking up. </p>
<p>BUT - if the same thing is being discussed elsewhere (which I'm sure is true), what's distinctive about Patient Empowerment WG in COVID-19?  Would we be better off going and being ambassadors into those discussions?</p>

<p>No-one's going to slap our hands for not getting the SWOT done in the next month or two.  (In fact, the next hand-slapping opportunity won't even roll around until September :) )</p>
