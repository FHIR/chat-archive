<p>I just saw the following post from the Distance Resistance group on Facebook.<br>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/distanceresistance" target="_blank" title="https://www.facebook.com/groups/distanceresistance">https://www.facebook.com/groups/distanceresistance</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A friend has the virus and she’s too sick to sit in front of a computer to track her symptoms, fever, etc., so she needs a quick chart - something she can print/can fill in manually - one sheet per day (24hrs Data points she wants to track by the hour:<br>
Temperature<br>
Blood oxygen<br>
Heart rate<br>
Blood pressure<br>
Emotional state -scale 1-10<br>
Pain/Discomfort-scale 1-10<br>
Cough - scale 1-10<br>
New symptoms<br>
Daily weight<br>
Food intake<br>
I looked online but haven’t seen a chart contenting all these field. Are you aware of anything that she can use?<br>

<p>I suspect there are a lot of people out in the world wanting to track these sorts of things right now, and there might be some utility in providing a reference Questionnaire and mappings to the associated Observations and LOINC/SNOMED codes.   It's a nice little patient story and insight in how people are responding and thinking about self tracking from non-medical professionals.  </p>
<p>Kvetch:  I wish we could spend Thursday conference call meetings talking about topics like this, instead of rehashing the charter (yet again).</p>

<p>Yes! Use the calls to work on patient enabling profiles.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191678">@Abigail Watson</span> Thank you for that! I knew people would start coming up with things they can do with or without institutional support.  I've just joined that group. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/distanceresistance/permalink/2825006364201358/" target="_blank" title="https://www.facebook.com/groups/distanceresistance/permalink/2825006364201358/">Here's that thread.</a>  Somebody did post a COVID-19 health diary in response - it's a PDF!!  Someone more technical than me should look into whether it can be made online (for those who want to) and (optionally) aggregated for the epidemiologists.</p>

<p>Dave, the Facebook link seems to be broken. Can you check it?</p>
<p>We will have our symptom tracker out very soon. We’re just finishing up the COVID-19 self assessment and already working on the symptom tracker. Several engineers head down focused.</p>

<p>Glad to hear about your symptom tracker!</p>
<p>The FB link works for me - I'm guessing since it's a private group you may need to join the group first. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/distanceresistance/" target="_blank" title="https://www.facebook.com/groups/distanceresistance/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/distanceresistance/</a></p>

<p>Distance Resistance was the group that created and registered the StayHome,SaveLives #QuaranTeam Frame on Facebook.   </p>
<p>If you click 'Update' on your photo, go to Frames, you can select the #QuaranTeam frame, and literally set a timer for 2 weeks.  And your profile pic will let everybody know you're quarantining and will remind you when you're 14 days are done.  It's a workaround using a feature that wasn't intended for quarantining, but Distance Resistance managed to figure out a $0.02 hack on the Facebook infrastructure that lets 2 billion people have a quarantine timer. </p>
