<p>Let's just put the back and forth informal conversation between patient and provider in a box for now and assume we have that solved (and we might).  There is alot more we have to get to.</p>
<p>We need to represent either via FHIR or a workaround (like a phone call!)</p>
<ul>
<li>cancellation of the request (the further thru the process the more annoying this would be)</li>
<li>some level of updating of the request (I suggest we limit this ability as much as possible to keep it simple.  They can always cancel and recreate and app could shield them from the pain of that)</li>
</ul>
<p>we also need to represent partial correct and partial deny</p>
<ul>
<li>I recommend we progress the status to complete and create an output record that describes what was accepted and what was rejected and tell them how they can disagree with what was rejected.  I suggest we do this in lieu of spawning additional tasks or such.  Keep it simple.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to get more rigorous in our representation of the codes/topics fields and the inputs, outputs, or payloads.</p>
<ul>
<li>a code to mean correct record, a code to mean disagree</li>
<li>
<p>a code for each kind of input or output<br>
-what does a denial look like</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what does a complete with corrected response in output look like?</p>
</li>
<li>how do you communicate who to notify?</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need to figure out how this will actually look to the patient on their portal or outbound API - will they see their data corrected?  Will they see anything that shows it was corrected?  Will they see their disagreement?</p>
