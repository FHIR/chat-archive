<p>Hello!<br>
Has anybody else actually managed to fetch their medical records using Apple HealthRecords?   We managed to connect Symptomatic up to HealthKit, and are pulling records in via FHIR, and everything is working great.  But now we're in TestFlight, and it appears people can download Symptomatic Timeline, but it doesn't help them much if they're not near one of the ~70 hospitals piloting Apple HealthRecords.  Ah!  </p>

<p>FIY, these are the 150+ currently supported health systems: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208647" target="_blank" title="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208647">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208647</a><br>
We also have LabCorp and Quest, which I'm assuming many have used to receive test results. You can create an account (incl. KBA) right from within the OAuth flow.</p>

<p>Do LabCorp and Quest have FHIR end points? Or is the connection using some other API?</p>

<p>Well, the records are being stored as FHIR resources in the Health app, and you can access the raw JSON and export a Bundle of resources directly from the app itself.  I can only imagine that they're being received as FHIR, and that LabCorp and Quest have FHIR endpoints in production now.  All in all, it's working great.  And we were super excited that we could pick that data up via a 3rd party app.</p>
