<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196361">@Ryan Howells</span> , I gotta say this announcement may be great in geekworld, but it's completely over the head of my friends and family. Can there be an "ordinary people" version of this please?  (It's over MY head.  The announcement is clearly impressed with itself, but <em>je n'ai pas de clue</em> WHY it's impressed with itself.)</p>
<p>Or, maybe it's not relevant yet - maybe it'll be years before it touches them or affects anything.  But I find that as I show excitement about the <em>data liberación</em> FHIR will bring, they're starting to get curious about how it will affect them. </p>
<p>I suspect it wants at very least a "Why it matters" link, or some such.</p>
<p>Also, if this will have ANY effect on consumer ability to create their own solutions e.g. for the <a href="https://www.epatientdave.com/2020/01/22/announcing-the-inaugural-american-patient-innovator-track-at-fhir-devdays/" target="_blank" title="https://www.epatientdave.com/2020/01/22/announcing-the-inaugural-american-patient-innovator-track-at-fhir-devdays/">Patient Innovator</a> fiesta at DevDays, those of us involved in that need to understand.  cc <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191354">@Rien Wertheim</span> </p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Yes <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span> it’s a bit geeky. Let me try and simplify.</p>
<p>As a result of this announcement, here are the options for patients to get their health info (and obviously these could be combined such as manual + digital):<br>
1) Manual - Use right of access to access paper copies just like we do today. <br>
2) Digital (Use any app) - Individual selects an app who have connected using FHIR to access their Argonaut + USCDI data. Privacy, Security, and Data sharing is governed by the apps terms and conditions. <br>
3) <em>NEW</em> Digital (App contractual pathway) - App signs the Carequality framework which is a legally binding contract and must abide by their data sharing, privacy, and security requirements which will be built off the CARIN code of conduct. Apps who violate these provisions will be kicked off the Carequality network and may have other legal repercussions.</p>
<p>Does that help? Keep in mind all of these paths are voluntary. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="200498">@Brendan Keeler</span> anything you’d like to add? Or others?</p>

<p>My concern with number three is it puts an unreasonably high level of trust in these apps -- basically saying that an app has the technical ability to query for data about any patient it can think of (even if the appw doesn't have the legal right to do so).</p>

<p>Tentatively (since I'm not smart enough to assess actual risk) that would be a major showstopper, if it is what it sounds like. But I might be misinterpreting.  </p>
<p>It SOUNDS like the whole thing depends on obedience to the Code of Conduct, which some patient activists have been "snort-skeptical" about, because without an actual enforcement squad, there's still no protection against bad actors who say "SURE I'll be good!"</p>
<p>But as I say, for me that's an uninformed worry - what do others say?</p>

<p>To be clear, full trust in model number two also requires some belief in an app's code of conduct. It's just that individual patients need to make this decision for themselves (no data can flow without an individual patient "at the keyboard") -- but once a patient is there and says yes, of course an app could always still be lying about how it is going to use that patient's date.</p>

<p>On number three, the "idea" is that apps will be contractually required to use a third party "identity proofing" service, and only after the app is satisfied about the patient's identity should the app issue a query request to a care quality network.</p>

<p>My concern about number three is the flow of trust: it's not enough to contractually obligate the app developers to verify a patient's identity. The (carequality compatible) network allowing the app to connect should have some technical skin in the game so it can verify the patient's identity directly.</p>

<p>And Ryan, you say the code of conduct is a "legally binding contract" - that reminds me too painfully of the HIPAA Right of Access, <em>which is unenforceable by an individual.</em>  What enforcement of the contract (i.e. surveillance and punishment) can patient activists expect to see? That's gotta be costly to CARIN.</p>

<p>And my concerns are definitely solvable in a technical fashion (For example, passing along "verifiable claims" from an identity proofing service to an app user and then having the user present those claims  to the network for verification. Or as another example, through a properly stacked arrangement of open ID connect interactions -- though obviously in this forum I'm trying to wave my hands technically without getting into any details.)</p>

<p>Regarding the consumer experience of identity verification: sure, today there are basically services that rely on in-person proofing (like passing your driver's license to the clerk at a clinic), and online services that rely on some combination of knowledge based authentication or uploading photos or videos of yourself alongside an existing credential, or verification of known facts about you like a phone number or an email address by making sure you can respond at those endpoints -- all kinds of interesting approaches.</p>

<p>Some of these in my opinion don't do a great job from the privacy perspective (For example I think the knowledge based authentication services wind up incentivizing data hoarding, because the more obscure facts that a company knows about you, the "better" they can quiz you to confirm your identity)</p>

<p>When I talk about the network having some skin in the game, what I mean is that the network should not take a consumer app's word when it comes to identity verification. The network or the organizations releasing data should be directly (automatically, seamlessly) reviewing identity claims and determining whether they meet requirements.</p>

<p>Josh has fully articulated "the three paths". </p>
<p>Smart on FHIR patient authorized exchange is the safest but a non ideal experience for consumers who struggle with many portals.</p>
<p>For trusted exchange networks:</p>
<p>Simple Code of Conduct can and will be abused (or "misunderstood"). Commonwell does a good job with this model by requiring certain identity vendors like Experian, though.</p>
<p>Network with full or partial trust infrastructure "skin in the game" (i.e. centralized identity infrastructure) is ultimately good so they can easily audit. But more work for CARIN and Carequality</p>

However, when it comes to queries for purposes of "patient" access, then Josh is absolutely correct.  In some cases certain EHR vendors response rate for patient queries is zero percent.  However, there are other EHR vendors who have health providers who are responding on a limited basis for patient queries.  Obviously, we are hoping all of this will be changing in the oncoming months with the announcements yesterday by CMS and ONC.</p>

<p>To be clear, uncertainty about identity is a <em>real</em> problem, unlike a lot of other excuses for not sharing data. The query network has no relationship with the individual, and providers haven't authenticated the individual, but they're still being asked to attain some level of certainty and then send out PHI.</p>

<p>Thanks @josh - that text help. So patient facing app could get data from the Carequality network but they have to become member of it first, correct? How does that happen? ..then once you become a member you 'send queries to the network' - how? and maybe you get an answer or maybe not ...how? ...and then according to the announcement there is (or there is going to be) some central authentication system (??) ... how does that work / will work? Isn't there docs somewhere where this is explained? Would seem pretty basic</p>

<p>This has been a great discussion. Based on some statements from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196361">@Ryan Howells</span> (please weigh in!), my understanding is that the goal here is primarily to leverage the trust framework and agreements that Carequality has worked to put into place, but that the actual patient-centric access would continue via direct connections to health systems, i.e., it would <strong>not</strong> leverage the existing (primarily C-CDA-based) query network. The theoretical benefit would be that an app could register once and be accepted by everyone within the ecosystem. Same for identity - the same SMART auth would be used for each connection, but the possibility exists of a single trusted credential accepted by anyone in the network. I think there is a dearth of details here, and I'm reserving judgment, but that's my current (possibly uninformed) understanding.</p>

<p>Hello all, please bear with any Zulip faux pas, as I’m new to the app and this forum.  I know many of the folks weighing in here, but for those who don’t know me, I’m Carequality’s Executive Director and collaborated with Ryan on the blog post that originated this thread.  </p>
<p>I’ve proposed to Ryan that a webinar on Carequality and consumer-driven health information access would probably be helpful.  I won’t be able to address every question raised here briefly, but I can confirm that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193764">@Ricky Bloomfield</span>  does have it basically right.</p>
<p>To (sort of) address the question from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>  about the role for Carequality’s existing support for query-based document exchange via SOAP-based IHE profiles, we do plan to leverage our existing services and processes, while also adapting to the different environment involved with FHIR-based exchange.  I recognize that might sound wishy-washy.  Operating in a FHIR-based, app-driven environment realistically will require some differences from our existing operations, but we’ll nonetheless try to reinvent the wheel as few times as possible.</p>

<p>Our FHIR-based exchange guide is still in draft form, and in two parts.  You can find the technically-oriented portion here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iOour1orfMpYS30L2AU2wajZRXl7p6YWlk5F61TcZ1M/edit?ts=5d920fe0" target="_blank" title="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iOour1orfMpYS30L2AU2wajZRXl7p6YWlk5F61TcZ1M/edit?ts=5d920fe0">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iOour1orfMpYS30L2AU2wajZRXl7p6YWlk5F61TcZ1M/edit?ts=5d920fe0</a> (not quite sure of protocol for hyperlinks here so putting it in as plain text).</p>
<p>The policy-oriented portion is here:  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e-6sjXxze0kIndJ-ZRYQw0sY6LYa8KxlhPc1Ao71OpQ/edit" target="_blank" title="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e-6sjXxze0kIndJ-ZRYQw0sY6LYa8KxlhPc1Ao71OpQ/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e-6sjXxze0kIndJ-ZRYQw0sY6LYa8KxlhPc1Ao71OpQ/edit</a></p>
<p>We have workgroups meeting to fully flesh out these drafts, generally on a weekly basis.  They are open to anyone who wishes to participate, and to join you can email us at <a href="mailto:admin@carequality.org" title="mailto:admin@carequality.org">admin@carequality.org</a>.  </p>
<p>You will see that the technical portion is not a "FHIR spec".  For the actual resources being accessed, we will point to existing specs developed by FHIR accelerators (or anyone else who develops a useful and cogent spec for a resource that is needed).</p>

<p>That's right, definitely still a draft and incomplete.  There are technical and policy workgroups that are meeting to flesh it out fully, and they are open to all who are interested in participating.  </p>
<p>Note that you can also check out our existing Query-Based Document Exchange Implementation Guide, which is complete and has been in production use for a long time.  As the discussion above noted, however, there are some challenges for consumer access in that model, that we're addressing in the FHIR context.  I'm happy to talk with anyone on the consumer side about participating in the doc exchange model, but if you're new to Carequality, it will probably make sense in most cases to focus on FHIR.  We are aiming to have the FHIR guide complete and formally adopted for production use by the end of this year.</p>

<p>In this diagram, is Carequality playing the role of "EHR Auth Server"? So apps would be issuing queries <em>not</em> in "god mode," but rather using tokens scoped to one specific patient?</p>

<p>For this to work, I think it means Carequality taking on the identity-matching problem centrally... or somehow establishing how identity attributes would be tied back to the signed-in user, when a query gets sent.</p>

<p>Yes, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span> is right. Between preparing for today and reading/summarizing the rules, there's a lot going on!</p>
<p>I would agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193764">@Ricky Bloomfield</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="270627">@Dave Cassel</span> on what they've said. I would also add it's still a work in progress. It's one of the reasons we tried to be very careful in our wording when we said "will work to develop". Our goal (like we did with Blue Button) is to notify the industry early who is working on these issues and where they can go to dive in (e.g., HL7, CARIN, Carequality, etc.). </p>
<p>It's important to note the approach that is in the current Carequality documentation may or may not be what we finalize together over the next few months for the consumer app side. As with Carequality's work, our identity work is also open to anyone who would like to join.

The diagrams you are referencing, at this point, are sets of ideas we're still kicking the tires on with respect how to approach authorization/authentication. Especially on the (patient facing) app side. That is why you see multiple paradigms of connectivity.

<p>Glad some discussions have helped get people up-to-speed. The main problem is as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> said is that user-as-the-patient is new to the network, and thus the trust chain has not yet been woven. There is a real concern that adding user-as-the-patient might be maliciously abused, thus we need to be very careful to assure that security and privacy are designed into the system at the start.   This could initially be modeled after the provider organizations, in that an organization vouches for the tenacity of the identity provisioning, and as such takes responsibility for any false claims that THEY issue (SAML Assertion). These organizations would likely be PHR organizations, but could be proxy bridges eventually.</p>

<p>I think PHR organizations <em>don't</em> and shouldn't need to be authoritative -- they can let patients bring in claims from elsewhere.

<p>That's vaguely what we were doing with the FhirBlocks project, but without blockchain.  The project was also exploring Yubikey, 2FA, and some other authentication schemes.  The stumbling block we ran into was the assumption (not mine) that Epic would simply update its servers to accept a sovereign ID (or DID in Josh's example) just because our pilot project asked them to.  Since Meteor on FHIR (now Node on FHIR) can work as a proxy server, we implemented some basic sovereign/DID key signature generation on our own servers to prove the concept.  But yeah...

<p>trusted third part is what I was refering to.. just simplified it into the PHR vendor scope. The important part is that the identity provisioning must be fully trustable. The session authentication (2FA, etc) is secondary. Both are important, but one can have a wonderful strong session authentication while having zero trustable identity provisioning. Hence why NIST 800-63 has broken these out into two different vectors, with a third vector on federation claims. --- again, we do not need to invent standards, NIST has already defined these.</p>

But yes, Carequality provides a trust framework to interconnect networks.  Carequality provides the essential elements to enable exchange of health related information.  Carequality has defined the common rules of the road (policy and governance framework to empower trust); well-defined technical specifications (can point to existing standards from Argonaut, DaVinci, etc but are well defined in one implementation guide) and Operational support for a directory of participants, technical security tokens and other required services. The current use case in production is the Query Based Document Exchange Implementation Guide (exchanging 90+ Million documents per month), but there are Push Notifications and FHIR Implementation Guides in development.  Lastly, there are PHR implementers on Carequality today.  For instance, OneRecord <a href="http://onerecord.com/" target="_blank" title="http://onerecord.com/">http://onerecord.com/</a> is one such PHR network.  All workgroups are open to all to participate, just send an email to <a href="mailto:admin@carequality.org" title="mailto:admin@carequality.org">admin@carequality.org</a>. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>From a Security/Privacy perspective, the fundamental difference between an EHR and a PHR with regards to "god mode" is that a PHR is accessing a patient record onbehalf of that patient, with the data accessible on that PHR only by that patient. Yes the patient can then provide access to others, but it is a assignment action by that patient. Where as an EHR or clinical application requesting access to data is going to incorporate the results into the EHR (or clinical application) where role-based-access-control will allow others to access it for Treatment, Payment, and Operations. Under the treatment purposeOfUse the hope is that it is constrained to legitimate relationship (care Team) with appropriate 'safety' exceptions, etc. The reason is that once data has been used by a practicing clinician within an organization, then that data is part of the legal medical record of that organization. That organization has obligations they must uphold around medical records retention and health safety. Thus when a Treatment PurposeOfUse is asserted, it is not going to be limited to the USER making the request, it is a request on behalf of the ORGANIZATION, and the retention expectation would be for the life of the medical record retention at that organization and the future access controlled by that organization policies. Thus a access control decision to release for Treatment (which should explicitly include Payment and Operations; but often these are implied), must be made based on the ORGANIZATION requesting, not the USER. The USER should be recorded in audit logs, as the triggering user.   These are NOT bright lines, they should be more bright than they are. But this is how I get to an understanding that an authorized Treatment PurposeOfUse is onBehalf of the organization requesting; where a Patient Request is onBehalf of THAT patient, not the PHR agent. Yes the PHR agent does need to be trusted, but that trust should be in the hands of the Patient, not in the hands of the custodian making the access control decision to release data.  (Note Research and PublicHealth PurposeOfUse are closer to EHR than they are PHR; but I expect them to be project specific within that broad purposeOfUse)</p>

<p>There's a twist though: usually when we talk about making sure these decisions are "not in the hands of the custodian making the access control decision" the goal is to ensure these custodians can't <em>prevent</em> patient access.

<p>Totally agree, Josh!  But how on earth could an app (a potential violator) be considered a custodian?  Maybe I missed important things in the mega-paragraphs back there.  </p>
<p>To be clear, given Facebook's transgressions in privacy in their Groups feature, and their being "too big to discipline," I consider it a certainty that someday some app will try to do that.  The gray market for scurrilously acquired data, for use by scurrilous resellers, is too likely to be attractive. So though I'm no expert on security, this is a big deal to me.</p>

<p>No, it is not what we are talking about here, what Josh is saying (and everyone agrees I think) is that app should not be trusted to do queries for data about anyone, but only for a specific patient at a time based on authorization granted by that specific person (that is the model currently used to connect  to individual providers using SMART-on-FHIR)</p>

<p>Ultimately a custodian has the duty to deny access unless there is a reason to release information. The role of access control decision is to consider all the context (user, app, consent, business rules, etc). This all starts with the prime vector of the Purpose for which data are being asked for. A patient user can't ask for data under Treatment, that should be denied. But a Patient must be allowed access if they ask under Patient Requested purpose. A payer can't ask for data under Patient Requested. etc...  This purpose vector not the ONLY factor, but is the prime differentiator. The important part is that data must not be exposed unless there is authorized access, AND that same rule is used by the patient to get their own damn data. <br>

<p>reality is ... trust fabric, which is usually a chain... and we all know the weakest link in a chain is the problem...   Which a well designed access control decision will consider the veracity of each security token.  Which is the point of NIST 800-63 three types of Level Of Assurance.</p>

<p>Agree <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> and great discussion. It's why NIST 800-63 and digital identity is so important to this discussion. We need to know for sure the request is coming from the unique individual (using FIDO2 could help tie it to a unique carbon life form) rather than a rogue app, a service, or someone acting on the individual's behalf without their permission. </p>
<p>Again, we see the goal as creating a set of contractual provisions that could be built into Carequality that also require technical certification from trusted third-parties (e.g., Kantara, SAFE, etc.). The combination of both could be the foundation for building contractual and technical trust in the ecosystem so a patient could voluntarily use their own credential to authenticate across multiple orgs.</p>

<p>Trust, yes... but not blind trust. Well designed security will enable appropriate and authorized access while forbidding inappropriate unauthorized access.</p>

<p>Very good; trust should never be blind. Can we make that an axiom? Must trust always be earned, with eyes kept wide open (aka not blind)?</p>

<p>As one of the authors working on the Draft Carequality FHIR technical IG linked above by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="270627">@Dave Cassel</span> , I have found this thread very interesting and have a few comments to add for feedback.</p>
<ol>
<li>The patient access use case goes well beyond simple federation of identity, because each digital identity also needs to be accurately matched to an actual patient in medical records. This is implicit in the issuance of patient portal credentials at a particular site, but not when the identity provider function is performed by a different party. There is also an interplay between identity proofing practices and patient matching. If patient matching is based upon trusted identity attributes linked to a credential (and nothing else), then the assurance level of the initial identity proofing sets an upper bound on the certainty that the user holding the credential is actually the subject of the matching patient record.</li>
<li>"God" mode is not the only approach being considered by Carequality. Authorization code flow is also part of the current draft. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>  mentioned bringing in identity claims from elsewhere. This powerful concept expands access and obviates the need for site-by-site patient portal credentials. To this end, we are also considering <a href="http://www.udap.org/udap-user-auth.html" target="_blank" title="http://www.udap.org/udap-user-auth.html">UDAP Tiered OAuth</a>, a workflow that is also included in the current draft of the CARIN BB IG. Tiered OAuth allows the user/app to indicate its preferred, trusted OIDC identity provider as part of OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow. Back-channel communication of verified identity attributes is used to increase security. The data holder can request only the information it needs to achieve the required matching confidence and the user/patient gets greater control over what attributes may be shared. If it makes sense for the use case, validation of identity attributes could also leverage privacy-preserving techniques to further enhance privacy. Since it builds on the authorization code flow, it also provides an opportunity for the data holder to interact with the user directly, not just for authorization purposes, but also when the identity cannot be resolved to a specific patient based on the available attributes.</li>
<li>Note that the trusted identity providers could be other data holders (e.g. providers or payers) on the network or standalone entities, as long as they follow the network policy. For example, a patient could use credentials from Hospital A and the client app of their choice to request data from Hospital C. They can even do this without sharing any identity information with the client app.</li>
<li>I agree that making any of these approaches (especially "god" mode) work for patient access use cases is dependent on, among other things, being able to trust the identity claims regarding the patient to be matched and the authority of the app to request the patient's data. Creating this trust requires both a policy framework that provides sufficient assurance that operational practices of the participants follow the rules and the technical capabilities to communicate the necessary identity attributes. Carequality is working on both.</li>
</ol>

<p>excellent clarity by Lois, as I always find to be true... There is an augmentation of ( 2 ) where provisioning flows happen to bind a user provided identity to a healthcare organization patient identity. The common method of using postal mail with a secret code is likely to continue to be dominant, and has the advantage of being able to leverage postal mail fraud against any malicious use of the contents of the letter.  postal fraud is one of the strongest fraud mechanisms USA has.  The advantage of this is that the binding strength can be much higher than hoping to match personal traits, especially since personal traits are leaked all over the place.</p>

<p>I am not sure I would agree with the clause in ( 2 ) where the identity holder can choose which subset of their personal traits are shared for identity verification. a malicious individual could use this to get as weak of a binding as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data holder can request only the information it needs to achieve the required matching confidence and the user/patient gets greater control over what attributes may be shared. If it makes sense for the use case, validation of identity attributes could also leverage privacy-preserving techniques to further enhance privacy. <br>
I guess a data holder could set the bar very high, but then that defeats the feature being described as privacy preserving... privacy preserving seems unnecessary in light of the request for highly sensitive medical data that the data holder already has (presumably).</p>
