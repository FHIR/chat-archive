<p>I am not sure how a denial or a disagreement are stored in the EHR or communicated.  It would make sense that both are communicated as documents (DocumentReference). <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191764">@Cooper Thompson</span> I know you have been looking at this - any idea?  I am going to ask around.</p>

<p>We have a narrative section on the Chart Correction case where the reason behind the disagreement can be documented.  So a disagreement/denial would show up as a Chart Correction case that had 1) a status of closed 2) no data changes made and 3) some narrative information about why nothing was done.</p>

<p>If a patient has a new visit, how will the practicing clinician know that the patient does not agree with the documented information?  A good example of this is Conditions which are sent everywhere and are part of reconciliation.  If a patient disagrees with a condition on their medical record, how will the clinician who is receiving a patient know what some of the data they are getting from another site is contested by the patient?   One site I talked to also stores the patient request and the proof of correction or the patient request and the denial and disagreement as documents.  However, it did not seem that the data was necessarily accessible at a useful point in the workflow.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191764">@Cooper Thompson</span> Note how on these example denial letters the HIM folk can check boxes like not owned or created by us: <a href="https://www.pitt.edu/hipaa/pdf-2013/Amendment%20Denial%20Letter%20Sample.pdf">https://www.pitt.edu/hipaa/pdf-2013/Amendment%20Denial%20Letter%20Sample.pdf</a> <a href="https://www.lsuhsc.edu/administration/cm/cm-53/AttachmentE-SampleLetter.pdf">https://www.lsuhsc.edu/administration/cm/cm-53/AttachmentE-SampleLetter.pdf</a>  Reminds me of some of the questions you were asking yesterday.</p>
