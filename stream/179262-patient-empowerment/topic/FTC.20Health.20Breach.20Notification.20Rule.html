<p>CARIN submitted comments tonight which haven't appeared yet but you can read them below if you are interested. We will also post them on our website. I thought there would be a large number of submissions especially given the new rules but was surprised to find there were only 15 comments submitted so far. I would strongly encourage this group to submit your comments and make your voice heard. Unfortunately, the due date is tomorrow, 8/20 by midnight ET. <a href="/user_uploads/10155/zW1sMXSyzdDGdxOW2Z6trthA/CARIN_FTC-Breach-Notification-Rule_08.19.2020_FINAL.pdf">CARIN_FTC-Breach-Notification-Rule_08.19.2020_FINAL.pdf</a></p>

<p>I must say, there was very little publicity around this. Even my staunchest advocate friends only brought it up in the final days and even then with only the sparsest hint of what's at stake. I wonder how we might do better next time.</p>
