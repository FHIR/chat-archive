<p>There is probably a better place for this but I'll start it here, for reference in  the <a href="#narrow/stream/179262-patient-empowerment/topic/The.20patient.20at.20DevDays" title="#narrow/stream/179262-patient-empowerment/topic/The.20patient.20at.20DevDays">patients at DevDays</a> thread.  </p>
<p>Note: not all "Superpatient" innovators would be users of FHIR data - the aspect I discuss here is the social change, enabled by all forms of tech. Social resistance and skepticism will be a factor in the success of our advocacy so it's useful to have plenty of evidence that skeptics are wrong.:-)</p>
<p><strong>von Hippel <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/when-patients-become-innovators/" target="_blank" title="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/when-patients-become-innovators/">"When Patients Become Innovators"</a></strong><br>
This is von Hippel's Sloan Management Review article, featuring Dana Lewis and Crohn's patient/innovator Sean Ahrens.  Importantly for some business readers, it includes a graphic from his book <em>Free Innovation</em> that explains the significant difference in motivation and process when patients are driving the process. (Actually, von Hippel asserts that patients are a special case of the general category of consumer home innovations.)</p>

Describes Tal Golesworthy, inventor of a surgery that radically improves life for Marfan Syndrome patients. Numerous other names, some familiar to me, some new. Look at the range of conditions!</p>
<ul>
<li>insomnia - online CBT</li>
<li>juvenile RA - violinist invents hand exercise device</li>
<li>thermal bra for mastectomy / reconstruction patients</li>
<li>medication adherence (evidently more than just a reminder app)</li>
</ul>

The BMJ piece includes this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Patient Innovation website (<a href="https://patient-innovation.com" target="_blank" title="https://patient-innovation.com">https://patient-innovation.com</a>) is a non-profit platform for patients and carers to share solutions to cope with their diseases, jointly led by Pedro Oliveira, a professor at Copenhagen Business School, and Helena Canhão, a professor at NOVA Medical School in Lisbon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191354">@Rien Wertheim</span>, it sounds like Oliveira and Canhão might be speaker candidates as well?</p>
<p>The BMJ article also cites the <a href="https://nhsaccelerator.com/" target="_blank" title="https://nhsaccelerator.com/">NHS Innovation Accelerator</a> as having supported some patient innovations.</p>

<p>The BMJ article ends with this boxed advice, worth noting, though again it's cultural, not specific to FHIR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Advice for doctors from patient innovators</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t assume your profession has a monopoly on medical knowledge and solutions for diseases. Open your mind</li>
<li>Consider the downsides to the existing therapy that is being questioned and revised by the patient innovator, and exercise a little vision and imagination</li>
<li>Work towards a logical plan that assesses the technical and medical problems in sequence: don’t try to approach and solve all the questions at once</li>
<li>If there is a real unmet need for this innovation then become its champion inside your trust. Without that, it is hard to scale</li>
<li>The natural instinct is to say no because it requires extra time and effort to start a project. Saying yes and then being engaged is key. Doctors have to be willing to partner patients</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Important distinction: this advice seems oriented toward a goal of product commercialization, in distinct contrast with von Hippel discussing free innovation developed just for its own end-user value and often given away.</p>
