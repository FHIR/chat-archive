<p>anyone else worrying about this? Anyone thinking like me when I see<br>
a) in a hospital "thanks for checking in. Do you consent to the use of your data with anyone in this hospital" (and then realizing that some people can use their role and my "consent" in hospital to send data to the insurance companies)</p>

<p>Definitely. The Dutch initially had an approach where one had to consent to the sharing of 182 potential categories of data. That's unworkable. Some may indeed be designing such systems on purpose, to obfuscate what one is consenting to, to use 'consent fatigue' to get people to agree to things which they wouldn't have agreed to when they would have really understood what is was all about.<br>
As such it's up to legislators, and to architects of national data exchanges, or creators of national consent registries, to come up with something coarse grained that's understandable to the average person. <br>
IMHO it's better to have a limited number of coarse grained policies that can be parametrized (using XACML) than to have a zillion fine grained policies. Consent fatigue will sure set in in the latter case.</p>

<p>This (patient empowerment) seems the right stream for a provocative statement for feedback: as a patient I also don't want to be burdened by complex consent. I do not want my GP to explain to me all that can happen to my information and ask me if I agree. I must have a trusted system that will only share the data that is lawful to share, for the lawful purposes and for the lawful time.</p>

<p>GDPR does provide some permissions to process data that the patient does not need to sign.  I'm basing my requirements on that (and the fact that consent may be flawed if it is not free or explicit)</p>

<p>Agree. Overwhelming means eventually meaningless - also legally meaningless. <br>
For example, I am covered by GDPR, and I kind of trust any consent that is given for me to sign, because I know that if anything sketchy is given for me to sign, this is not valid consent.</p>

<p>Having implemented a few consent management systems now (including one on hyperledger), I'm a little skeptical about the extent to which opt-in consent is even feasible.   </p>
<p>In some quarters, there seem to be attempts to legislate good outcomes, as if good health itself is a right.  i.e. I didn't consent to cancer.  I didn't consent to being given the flu.  I didn't consent to abuse or being assaulted.  etc.  As if the remedies that are applied in case of bad actors can also be applied to viruses, bacteria, fellow travelers, old age, etc.  Which the cynic in me thinks is futile.  </p>
<p>In the broader scheme of things, there's a counter argument to opt-in consent models that travel and entry into defined spaces can act as a type of consent in itself.  You go to a bar, and there's some level of consent to be in the same space as others who are imbibing alcohol.  If you travel by airplane, you're sort of consenting to listen to kids scream and maybe get this year's flu.  And so forth.  </p>
<p>So, I'm generally in favor of consent/privacy models where a) the patient maintains their own records (ID card, smartphone, dogtags, smart prosthetics, etc), that b) throttle on/off entire channels of data (FHIR resources, perhaps streaming via websockets), that is c) location aware.  That is, the Apple model.</p>
<p>As such, I'm very interested in NFC and RFID and Bluetooth models of consent.  Consent by proximity, as it were.  </p>
<p>If done correctly, geofences and geotag perimeters and such could provide automated roll-up packaging for more fine-grained controls, like what Josh is describing above.</p>

<p>For clarity we should not use "opt-in" and "opt-out" as terms of discussion as these terms are indistinguishable from their noun vs verb meaning. Thus understanding "Implicit Consent" vs "Explicit Consent" and the act of Asserting some choice to Permit vs Deny.</p>

<p>Context aware consents is an interesting point, and a point that changed HIPAA into the "Implicit Consent" that we have at the federal level. This presumes that the individual is clear on what they are doing by their choice to put themselves into a specific context. This is a good presumption but fails often because the obvious context does not include the implied consent that the healthcare organization wants to be enabled to do (imagine an iceberg).</p>

<p>The concept of consenting or dissenting to a set of "medical categories" is next logical, but also fails around the edges of the category definition. That is to say that the definition in the mind of the individual of what is within that category is sometime is not exactly the same as the boundary that the healthcare organization understands the boundaries of that category.  permissive vs restrictive interpretation of a category...  (this is built into Consent resource today, presuming some SLS can determine the category boundary)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191678">@Abigail Watson</span> your point about implicit consent is a good starting point. But on the other hand, one of the main reasons we have GDPR is that with tools of today, it is often not implicit enough for people. They take a quiz on Facebook without realizing that the information they give out will be weaponized and used to affect votes. The Cambridge Analytica case. With all the digital tools and data brokers, it is just not transparent enough.</p>

<p>My most sincere apologies <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span>! The main reason was that I did not find an obvious angle to tie what you said to what I was advocating for: the clear and recognizable labels describing data use.

<p>If it helps you make feel any better, I also did not comment on René's statements.

If you still crave more, I can come up with some nitpicking about the terms "opt-in" and "opt-out" still having their place in some of the discussion, because of their wide spread use - especially in how the question for a consent or a permission is formulated, and especially with the set defaults in policies. ;-)</p>

<p>Possibly me.  I've been an on-again-off-again AMIA member, and I've been preparing some journal articles as I prepare to extend my conference participation beyond HL7.  I'm not looking to be some sort of expert on consent issues (a role that people have previously tried to dump on me), but it's one of the topic areas we've covered in past projects and want to write about.  Mostly just want to cover the topic for peer-review purposes, and then let others own that space.</p>

<p>I'm helping prepare a proposal for a permission approach that may or not rely or consent and covers (the key areas of) GDPR. <br>
If that helps, I would love to share ideas and content.</p>

<p>A key point (will continue to discuss in Security stream) is the shift from "implicit consent" into "explicit permission":<br>
When a hospital, without patient consent(but under general policy, legal requirements, or any valid purpose), allows data to be shared with another party, that is a conscious, deliberate decision - someone has decided to open that flow.</p>

<p>I think that when I touch the healthcare system and they ask for a consent I shouldnt trust them.  I feel they should just know to do what is right.  You sign because you need the care and are afraid of what you signed.</p>

<p>yes, that is the other side of it: <br>
IMO, the hospital does not need my consent if they need the data to treat me.<br>
If they need data, this is a very legitimate use of data, no consent needed. <br>
If they don't need it but ask me a consent when I am suffering, this is not a legally acquired consent.<br>
(note I am not a lawer, this is my reading of the things in GDPR that are sensible)</p>

<p>We have an active discussion going on regarding this and patient-generated health data, i.e., the data that would be available from all the wearables you as a citizen/patient/person use. That data is not accessible to the healthcare system by default. And in some cases the healthcare system is interested in that data. How would they get access to it, and what would be the legal basis for accessing and processing that data? Consent seems the most viable option for this, but there are concerns over power balance. Any other views?</p>

<p>Could we also put a 'pin' in a need to transmit the UDI-DI and UDI-PI of the wearable if it is a medical device.  Right now efforts to use UDI of medical devices on the network are limited due to proprietary nature of these transmissions.  I am hoping that wearable technology groups would be more open with their data transmission and could obtain the value of being able to standardize device identification where not always possible with traditional networked devices</p>

<p>I don't know that consent would be necessary if the patient pushed the data to the practitioner.  (It would typically be needed if the provider were pulling it from another repository though.)</p>

<p>In GDPR terms you need to state the legal basis that you have to process the data. The ones listed by Jose above. Even if the patient pushes the data. You might argue that the consent is implicit, but the language in GDPR is quite clear that an explicit consent is required. It also means that the healthcare organization needs to inform the patient how the data will be used if the patient chooses to push the data.</p>
