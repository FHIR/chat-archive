<p>for the devdays hackathon, our team explored some ideas around choosing new providers and providing them with medical history.<br>
one of the ideas we had is particularly simple technically but I personally think could make a suprisingly big difference (in the long run).  first, I wanted to get this community's opinion on whether its worth trying to bring this forward to someone that can do something about it...</p>
<p>One aspect of the CMS rule for the 21s century cures act is that "under this rule, MA organizations, Medicaid FFS programs, CHIP FFS programs, Medicaid managed care plans, and CHIP managed care entities are required to make provider directory information available via the Provider Directory API. This API must be accessible via a public-facing digital endpoint on the payer’s website. To facilitate this, we link to the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net IG"</p>
<p>So here is the idea:  what if, as part of these provider directories, insurers would provide not just the name, location, contactinfo, and "accepting new patients" status of each provider, but also "whether they support electronic interchange of health information"?  is anyone doing this yet?  has anyone considered it?  is it worth pursuing?</p>

<p>these kinds of connections are indeed very helpful, and they have been a regulatory focus. The DaVinci implementation guide you linked to includes information about fhir endpoints that provider might have: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pdex-plan-net/2020Feb/StructureDefinition-plannet-Endpoint.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pdex-plan-net/2020Feb/StructureDefinition-plannet-Endpoint.html</a> (linked from Organization)-- would be good to understand what you see as the gaps.</p>

<p>thanks josh.  I havn't been much involved with provider directory stuff, just "joined" that community this last connectathon and so my knowledge is pretty limited.  i had seen the Endpoint profile but definitely havn't worked with it yet.  will check it out and come back.</p>

<p>for our hack project, we took the pdex plan-net reference implementation and added these fields so that when you search for providers, you see:</p>
<ol>
<li>are they accepting new patients (part of the spec already)</li>
<li>do they support patient access apis</li>
<li>do they support patient upload of information (which has the furthest to go it seems); and</li>
<li>do they support receiving clinical information from the insurer</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm very interested in the ability to see which providers actively practice interop!  </p>
<p>At the Society for Participatory Medicine we've long envisioned enabling consumer choice by somehow letting participatory practices identify themselves.  If this info became available by API it could be mashed into things like HealthGrades listings.  See for instance their Patient Safety and Patient Experience awards, which leverage data published elsewhere. <a href="https://www.healthgrades.com/quality/patient-safety-patient-experience">https://www.healthgrades.com/quality/patient-safety-patient-experience</a></p>
<p>(HCAHPS is notoriously weak as a measure of reality; that's not my point - it's that when data becomes available, it can be used, and it enables consumer choice, <em>which rewards practices who do it.</em> And I think that's what we want to do.)</p>

(at least) to the idea of being able to search for providers based on whether they willingly accept existing health records. </p>
<p>Of course for cases as complex as theirs it will take years before that vision is fully recognized. Doesn't matter.  For much simpler cases there will be an advertising advantage to providers who have some sort of "No clipboard required!" badge.</p>

<p>I think (2) from your list is basically the presence of an endpoint with an appropriate code (it would be good to clarify whether the "patient requested" code is the right one for this, or a new code is needed, because it's not an obvious fit for me).</p>
<p>(3) with respect to uploads, I suppose you could try to look at the capability statement you find for the endpoint you discovered in step 2. Of course in practice the answer is simply no they don't support it :-) there's currently no regulatory mandate for this. For (4) oh boy, I'm really not aware of an existing workflow that would even cause this information flow to happen without provider involvement; don't know that I would focus automated discovery for this piece yet, but maybe I'm missing something here.</p>

<p>yes, aware of this, but this is where we'd like to get to eventually, right?  like for "consumer-directed data exchange" we need to be able to actually share it back to the providers in a way it can be trusted, right?</p>

<p>Oh we totally need to make progress here, but I don't think <em>discovery</em> of which endpoints support this capability is the hard or important part. The important part is getting more endpoints to support it, and learning from that experience. when we've got something that actually works, mandating that providers publishe the endpoints becomes feasible.</p>

<p>not saying there would be no provider involvement and really not even sure if there's an appetite for this, was just thinking that with things like DaVinci PDEX / CDEX, it should be technically feasible.  perhaps in some use cases having a billing-centric history of the patient will be better than having no history at all?</p>

Describing other business practices of providers is super hard; for one thing, you need to figure out how to describe practices that don't involve these endpoints at all, like looking update about you and commonwell or Care quality.

<p>Yeah, we just need to be realistic about which methods are actually relevant for people making decisions. Today participating in some of these Nationwide exchanges is probably the most relevant way that information is flowing, even though there's plenty I don't love about it.

<p>I hate to get philosophical or negative here; I think this is super important and I just want to make sure we are putting in effort in places where it is going to pay off.

</blockquote>
<p>I think you are misunderstanding, or at least we disagree :-) Today the widest interoperability we have is through standardized, interoperable APIs where access control is partitioned by vendor. As such, those vendors are able to publish <strong>authoritative lists</strong> describing the endpoints in their network, allowing others to the discover, connect, and build on top. Indeed, anyone can take these independent endpoint lists and compile them into an  aggregated list, but the secret is that for this to be successful you need to actually add value (making sure it stays up to date with the sources with very little lag, reconciling any formatting difference is, annotating with additional data, etc). ONC is requiring more publication at the vendor level, and maybe once there's more than a few lists to scrape, aggregating content will become a more attractive proposition. But again, discovery is not the hard part. Today everyone who actually has a wide network has made it discoverable. The problem is that most have no network.</p>

<p>So, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> , perhaps indeed I'm misunderstanding, which would be great!   As someone not steeped at all in the technology nor the commercial world, dialog with people like you is invaluable to me. </p>
<p>I think I hear you saying that each vendor is publishing its own directory of <strong>things it knows about and/or has vetted,</strong> which is not at all an exclusive list of things it will talk to.  Am I hearing that correctly?</p>

<p>But I think you're missing my point. There is a chicken-and-egg problem is about <em>support</em>, not discovery. Support is about providers offering a service and patients using it (or for that matter, patients demanding a service and providers coming around). Scalable Discovery only matters later.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span> I would like to help make an interop "badge" happen as early as next year, rather than years from now. It is long overdue and institutions (not just practices) being formally branded as interop is a logical next step in the evolution of FHIR - as well as raising public awareness of the benefits to them of FHIR data that they can actually get at.

<p>anyway, maybe the 3 I mention aren't the right ones to expose in the provider directory, but then what are the right ones?  i'm looking for what would make sense to the patient to say "this provider can get your medical records from your other providers/you/somewhere else without you physically providing them or faxing them stuff"</p>

<p>What you said here about "<em>this provider can...without you...</em>" sounds something like "<strong>FHIR Smart</strong>"    (Too close to SMART on FHIR?). In any case, something that is easy to riff and encapsulates what Provider X does for you regarding your data will be needed. This thingy is going to need patient adoption, so it needs to be "adoptable".</p>
