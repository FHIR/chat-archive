<p>As for the Patient Innovator Track: it doesn't seem far fetched to include the family caregiver as a target audience. Just think of Kristina Sheridan. Let's put in on the list of things to discuss <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="197491">Dave deBronkart</span></p>

<p>I trust that <strong>you</strong> are maintaining said list :-) </p>
<p>Seriously though - if you look at the whole first generation of health data apps, many if not most were laboriously created (in the absence of good interop!) by family caregivers.  I'm sure <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191678">@Abigail Watson</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="225094">@Debi Willis</span> could add to the list, but some who come to mind are Amy Gleason's CareSync (for her daughter Morgan, who today has 23 portals, as I mentioned recently) and Lifetime Health Diary (MaryAnn Sterling).</p>
<p>It's essential to note that unlike people who are in it to make a killing (so to speak) financially, these people have a job to do that's really important to them.  They have this in common with the #OpenAPS people.  <strong>Effectiveness is essential to them, and their need never ends.</strong></p>
