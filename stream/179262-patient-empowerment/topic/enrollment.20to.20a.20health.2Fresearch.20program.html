<p>Hi folks, I'm looking for guidance re a use case for enrolling patients to mHealth / wellness programs as well as research studies. My real-world requirement is for an EMR to be able to tell our ePRO platform (patient reported outcome) to add a patient to a predefined project (e.g. Hip Replacement) so that a series of questionnaires and educational material can be sent to patients. To clarify, the actual content and scheduling of these touch-points are defined in the projects so there is no additional information needed during the enrollment - just the project ID of the program the patient is being admitted to. One exception is the ability to set a baseline data collection date (probably can be others but for future). </p>
<p>I reckon this sort of enrollment process should be a pretty common scenario so hopefully a solution exists!</p>
<p>I've been advised to use the Task resource in some former discussions.</p>
<p>Comments/Feedback/Advice welcome<br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191420">@Koray Atalag</span>  This is the info we store <br>

<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/10155/2KS59NiieMp--qS9VpTYauOD/enrolment.JPG" title="enrolment.JPG"><img src="/user_uploads/10155/2KS59NiieMp--qS9VpTYauOD/enrolment.JPG"></a></div><p>Initially this service was created to store GP enrolments for funding in NZ (so it's essentially storing the relationship between a patient (NHI ID) and the enrolling organization (Practice as Org ID)), + some metadata. We also store info on enrolments for entitlement programs (e.g. a Community services card, prescription subsidy card etc). </p>
<p>Both types of enrolment were designed to be general enough to be extensible/re-usable for any kind of health program enrolment. It's not on our immediate workplan though to re-do this in FHIR, so all I've been doing is keeping an eye on the FHIR resources / others wanting to do similar things so far to see if there's any progress on how we might do it in FHIR once we get there.</p>

<p>I think we'd discussed possibly expanding the scope of EnrollmentRequest/EnrollmentResponse and/or using List to manage your list of enrollemd members.  Task would be how you'd ask someone to complete a Questionnaire.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="195365">@Daniel Thomson</span> cool stuff! I agree it is an extensible model that could cater for a wide range of similar use cases.<br>
Today I had a chat with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191364">@Peter Jordan</span>  and he suggested to go with R5 and help rescope EnrollmentRequest and EnrollmentResponse. I'll get in touch with the relevant Work Group (Financial Management) to help develop an FMM Level 0 resource that could be usable in jurisdictions outside US.</p>

<p>Yes we did and thanks for the advice. As per above I think I'll go down this path. Can you point out to the right guy(s) in that WG - otherwise I'll just contact the co-chairs / post in their stream here</p>

<p>Sounds good. Happy to contribute or share more detail of any of the NZ Ministry of Health's experience / use cases with enrolment. <span aria-label="+1" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="+1">:+1:</span></p>
