<p>Anyone who is new to Patient Empowerment might enjoy our Newcomer Page - its purpose is to give our newcomers concrete actions they can do to make sure they can participate. we acknowledge that sometimes HL7 can be a bit overwhelming to newcomers with tools like Zulip, list servers, confluence, projects, and calendars of calls and events.   The page is designed to help you get up to speed quick in participating in our work.  Even includes a video which demonstrates what to do to get signed up everywhere and get involved and walks through how we do things. Its like our onramp.   It also might be helpful in general if you are new to HL7 and want to contribute.  <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97473026">https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97473026</a>.</p>
