<p>For DevDays, I want to share a patient empowerment project I've been working on the past few months.  This started off as a smart EMT kit, with the thinking that we would have a FHIR enabled app to track contents of your first-responder bag or medical home supply cabinet.  With Covid19 however, we suddenly have a need to organize respiratory care for first-responders, medical homes, paratransit vehicles, good samaritans, and others.  So the product has pivoted into respiratory care.</p>

<ul>
<li>Oxygen tank (over the counter)</li>
<li>Good Samaritan qualifying O2 regulator</li>
<li>Single use oxygen mask(s)</li>
<li>High-flow nasal cannulas</li>
<li>N99 mask</li>
<li>Disposable gloves</li>
<li>Hand sanitizer</li>
<li>Digital stethoscope</li>
<li>ECG monitor</li>
<li>Nighttime blood oxygen monitor</li>
<li>Portable kit bag</li>
<li>Supports Apple HealthRecords</li>
<li>All equipment is FDA Approved</li>
</ul>
<p>And here is the bag when it's all packed. (When I packed it for the first time, I breathed a small sigh of relief that I had a game plan for how to respond to emergency calls during upcoming waves of coronavirus.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Good Samaritan </li>
<li>Smart Kit </li>
<li>Physician/Paramedic </li>
</ul>
<p>The Good Samaritan is the kind of kit somebody might want in their car as they drive Uber and Lyft gigs, and are called to a location where somebody is short of breath.</p>
<p>The Smart Kit is for the version for medical homes and paratransit vehicles, which are monitoring high-risk family members. It will support Apple HealthRecords and nighttime monitoring equipment.</p>
<p>While the physician/paramedic kit is a clinician grade product that will provide routing recommendations to which local hospitals have the greatest bed/ventilator capacity.</p>
<p>Importantly, this is a way to AVOID putting people on a ventilator, and spreads the respiratory care load, thereby helping to flatten the curve.</p>
<p>Anyhow, long story short, we're introducing a product that has Break-The-Glass Protocol support on the roadmap.  <span aria-label="sunglasses" class="emoji emoji-1f60e" role="img" title="sunglasses">:sunglasses:</span></p>

<p>If you are tracking and you want to monitor as FDA approved, then you will be including UDIs.  Right?</p>

<p>Yup, that's the idea.  Technically, everything in the kit is over-the-counter and qualifies under Good Samaritan laws.  But for tracking purposes, yes, our software would track and provide the UDIs as part of the value-add for the professional products.</p>
