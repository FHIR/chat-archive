<p>SPM member Brenda Denzler was one of the finalists in last week's Patient Innovator Track at DevDays.  At the last minute she learned she had both a DVT and a PE, either of which would have prevented her from flying, so she got permission to instead present her story by recording her voice onto her slides.  Tonight I helped her convert it to video and upload to YouTube, and blogged it. 14 minute video:</p>
<p><a href="https://participatorymedicine.org/epatients/2019/11/my-data-and-me-brenda-denzlers-amazing-story-at-fhirdevdays.html" target="_blank" title="https://participatorymedicine.org/epatients/2019/11/my-data-and-me-brenda-denzlers-amazing-story-at-fhirdevdays.html">"My Data and Me": Brenda Denzler's amazing story at #FHIRDevDays</a></p>
<p>It's quite a remarkable story, illustrating how vitally important it will be that FHIR has the potential to integrate patient-generated / patient-sourced device data with more conventional data. </p>
<p>You'll see, too, that there's a surprising (to me) overlap between her case and that of Kristina and Kate Sheridan, who were our Friday keynote speakers. (They were part of my A'dam talk last year, and Rien invited them this year.)</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing it Dave. I read your article and watched her presentation. Both were wonderful. <span aria-label="+1" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="+1">:+1:</span></p>
