<p>Is this something that would be a weekly call basis? Do 'we' issue an IG? Do we require USCDI/MedMij and what not to conform to this IG? Are 'we' if only a little in IHEs backyard with this.

<p>Yes, CARIN is developing IGs for patient focused IGs along with other groups. Accessing patient summary data is the responsibility of Argonaut. They will be developing an R4 version of their IG which will include all of USCDI v1 as described in the ONC proposed rule. They are also developing an appointment IG. CARIN is developing IGs so patients can access all of their claims information from health plans so plans can be compliant with the CMS proposed rule. We are also developing a consumer-facing real time pharmacy benefit check capability for consumers to see their OOP pharmacy costs, and we are working with CMS on making the post-acute care assessment information available to consumers. We would welcome others thoughts in making more data available to patients.</p>

<p>Good initiative, and I agree that the outcome is unclear. IHE (<a href="http://www.ihe.net" target="_blank" title="http://www.ihe.net">www.ihe.net</a>) has some IG that are intended to have the patient engaged with them, but there is not logical place in IHE for a focus on the patient.

<p>I suspect that at best we can have a community of interest, made up of people that are participating in one or more of these initiatives. In this way we can share what is happening, and call upon our peers at specific points.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> you may recall your talk with our Ministry of Health folks. I dropped this initiative with them and we agreed that being able to talk about this type of topic might just be the type of platform we need for scaling up  - in my mind within HL7 not the FHIR Foundation but hadn't put too much thought into that part yet - John says that IHE may not be a natural fit for this; I'm still convinced we'd need IHE input. Patient focused APIs should, I think, be as much as possible be the same as provider APIs.</p>
<p>Sure enough there's stuff to flesh out, the questions I raised earlier for example, but probably more. Example: we have not yet decided whether or not we go to R4, so from where I currently stand I'm more interested in talking interaction patterns that work across FHIR versions than solutions that tie into "the latest version only". This may shift as internal R4 talks progress.</p>
<p>I hope this can be the start of a new level of interaction between similar initiatives that currently live in different project realms.</p>

<p>As an implementer of patient-centric (or even citizen-centric) self-care apps, we (Sensotrend) have found the HL7 FHIR specification to include everything we need API-wise. We're doing everything on <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>'s list, except USCDI access. I don't see the need to create new APIs.

<p>It's not so much a question of creating new APIs as it is of standardizing/profiling them so that there's consistent data exposed to and access by patient-facing apps.</p>

<p>I do agree that dominant work is just grouping existing profiles in a way that presents them around patient centric use-cases. Often the IG are very Provider, EHR, or Payer centric. This is simply a perspective shift, not a technical change. <br>
I think the patient empowerment might uncover some APIs that are driven by patient desire to do something that Providers , EHR, and Payers are not interested in providing.</p>

<p>We (Symptomatic) are very much in this space also, and like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192917">@Mikael Rinnetmäki</span>  have also found the FHIR spec in general to cover 80% of what we need.  The remaining 20% could be summarized in the following two challenges (imo):</p>
<p>1. Coordination of test patients between EHR vendors.  We're finding that each EHR has a different set of test patients (Jason/Jessica Argonaut, Nancy SMART &amp; family, Candace Salinas, etc).  Which is nice, but doesn't help with use cases around patient matching, consolidating patient summary data, and otherwise.  This is ostensibly what the Ring of FHIR project is hoping to address (I think), although the Synthea project is also relevant.  It would be great to get an IG for a longitudinal patient record that encompases all the major EHR vendors.  Register that longitudinal patient in Synthea, have the folks running Ring of FHIR register the patient in each of the participating EHR instances, fetch that patient across the Ring of FHIR, and get that reference in place so these patient centered apps can compare their results with the benchmark.  <br>
2. Secondly, it's the 'write data' use case.  And specifically...  how to track provenance?  How is quality control performed?  Are standards such as the Integrated Health Model Initiative (IHMI) and other evidence-based-medicine being supported?  What does the workflow for return data look like?  Is it fully automated or is it queued?  And so forth.  We have some ideas about how we want (hope) these processes to look like, but I suspect it's going to be cat-herding of different ideas.  My worry is that the major EHRs are going to try to influence these IGs, and they're going to default to an assumption of keyboards, mice, and laptops because of intrenched investments; and ignore advanced/consumer haptics use cases involving NFC, geolocation, voice, IoT, etc.</p>

<p>The things we found solutions for in MedMij that may or may not be the same as Argonaut and other initiatives, and where I would like to have a proper conversation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We implemented the patient summary using queries on the individual building blocks. Push to the Patient is not supported in MedMij anywhere. No document, no compartment, no operation, no graph. This serves some things really well and complicates others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We looked at Argonaut for Appointments and found the method for canceling using PATCH too complicated. We used an operation instead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We looked at SDC for Questionnaire(Response) and found it lacked provisioning the Q to the patient. We added a Task construct for that. That solution is going to be balloted locally soon. We were not ready for the operations in SDC and decided not to include those currently. We did not address how to find where the QR goes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's these and other things like it, where we might support each others basic FHIR resources, likely do not understand each others code systems and extensions, but we might not be able get the basic flows running because we don't support the same interaction patterns.</p>
<p>I don't know at this point what a patient focused API is, but my interpretation would be that we try to harmonize how we leverage the existing FHIR API spec for certain use cases. So it is not so much the invention of something new, but rather how to constrain similarly.</p>

<p>well, any specification of an API starts with use-cases... and there are some use-cases that are driving some FHIR API definitions that are not appropriate for a patient to be engaged in... like reporting on population health statistics... not that we are trying to hid something, just that an API has a defined use-case</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Think it through in terms of syntax and grammar.  In English, we have nouns, verbs, direct objects, possessives, propositions, etc.  The default FHIR API is pretty much just verbs (get/put/post/delete) acting on nouns (resources).  SMART on FHIR then extends that model by introducing direct-objects via the provider launch context.  No longer am I simply an abstract librarian fetching an abstract medical record; but now I'm a provider fetching the records of a specific somebody else.    </p>
<p>The thing is... somewhere along the way, we began to assume that SMART on FHIR provider launch context is the default.  From a business perspective, traditional billable activities for providers (and ROI) is all within the provider launch context.  So implementors simply begin with the provider launch context, because that's where the money is.  Patient launch context is still not implemented on some of the major EHR vendor systems.  </p>
<p>But back to the syntax and grammar model… a Patient API would have a few things…   a SMART on FHIR patient-launch context, at the very least.  That would involve using the launch context to describe a sense of ‘self’.  Basically a self-referential loopback, similar to 127.0.0.1, but at the application level.  I suspect that will involve putting the patientId in some standardized place along with the OAuth access token, as it seems to differ between EHR implementations right now.    </p>
<p>Once we can get that sense of ‘self’, then the grammar and syntax of the API can have meaningful possessive attributes.  The most interesting of which is probably a <code>$my</code> operator, followed by <code>$near</code>,<code>$recent</code> and other prepositions.  <code>Get my procedures.  Get my medication orders.  Get providers near me.</code> and so forth. </p>
<p>Compare that in contrast to the provider/EHR model of looking up a patient…  name, age/date of birth, sex/gender?  Why would any patient need or want to look up records in such a format?  How often does that change?  It's entirely premised on a many-to-one usecase, whereas the Patient API usecase is almost entirely one-to-one(self).  Also, what value would a <code>$my</code> operator be to a provider?  The patient doesn’t care about their doctor’s medical records.  But as a patient you know what would be useful?  <code>POST $my Medications _history $to Providers $near $me.</code>  I'm using pseudocode to illustrate the point; and how that gets sorted out to REST API I'm not sure.  But suffice it to say that there would be different usage patterns for Patient centric access.  </p>
<p>tl;dr…  Anyhow... much of what would be needed to satisfy the needs for a Patient API will probably involve SMART on FHIR and query/search parameters.</p>

<p>I have a feeling I'm not the right person to sort out (yet) what the heck you guys are saying - John seems to be saying patient API is a subset of BHAGAPIOE (big hairy audacious generic API of everything), whereas Abigail is talking about adding direct objects (love the grammar metaphor, Abigail). </p>

<p>The only addition I'd make is that a patient API will almost certainly also want to extend to accessing the records of children or other family members the user has care responsibility for (and permission to access).  So part of the API will be about how to manage such access requests</p>

<p>The differences in different countries would come down to legislation and culture, same as always.  What providers are allowed/required to share may differ, expectations for proof of identity (and infrastructure to support it) will differ, rules around access to data for children will differ.   And, of course, the standards mandated on the data itself (e.g. codes for drugs) will also differ.  Can't insulate the patient API from those impacts.</p>

<p>They weren't to my knowledge. The Appointment stuff was produced in a pressure cooker situation, and we first took the outcome  to a local PoC type of setup. The feedback was minimal so far.

* I need to pull up my notes about my random mild gout episodes, because it&#39;s getting annoying enough I finally want to talk to someone about it
* I want to create an EMT Info sheet that summarizes what ambulance people will need to know,  so they can view it while racing to the scene (home, car crash, restaurant...) and so that it AUTOMATICALLY STAYS UP TO DATE

<p>Well, that's certainly interesting to know.  SMART on FHIR basically specifies FHIR and OAuth (and OpenID).  We might be able to refactor the patientId away from the OAuth scope and into a RESTful endpoint.  <code>/fetchMyPatientId</code> or <code>fetchMyIdentity</code> or similar.</p>

<p>One REALLY compelling use case for caregivers, btw, is defending against flipping STUPID UNDERPAID IDIOTS who work in some doctors' offices these days.  </p>
<p>I'll drop in this true scare-bomb:  when my mom saw a new eye doctor last year, an assistant interviewed her as usual (because of course her data couldn't flow in), and then in the doc's room he examined her and said "It looks like we're going to need to do surgery."  She asked why (the symptom wasn't that bad) and he said "It's the best thing to do, since you're diabetic." "I am not," she said.  He pointed to the chart, created minutes earlier.</p>
<p>It turns out the idiot assistant, reviewing meds, had seen one that's PRIMARILY for type 2 diabetes but has other indications. Stupid Idiot saw it and also wrote that Mom's diabetic!  Without asking or even noting that she did.</p>
<p>Maybe this use case is dubbed SDAIMA - self-defense against idiot medical assistants. </p>
<p>OTOH, in this case clearly the doc himself is culpable for handing a medically critical task to someone he hasn't trained to handle the responsibility! My point stands.</p>

<p>Sure from experience in various studies we found that very large percentages of patients found errors in their records after gaining access. They also became frustrated rapidly if the processes were not in place to correct them.<br>
Another area of fun is providers contradicting each others diagnoses. For example because you switched providers and data becomes outdated.</p>

<p>Yes, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191375">@Alexander Henket</span> , there are many reasons for the patient to become the "single source of truth."

<p>In the studies there were some experiments with MedicationStatements. Most was face2face though. At the very least the PHR should be able to let a patient mark faulty data so he isn't presented in the interface with that every time.</p>
<p>We intend to make MedicationStatements flow back electronically in general but aren't there yet. The patient did not appear to mind about  the exact measures at his disposal for correction, as long as he could.</p>

<p>We're seeing that general sentiment also.  As soon as we started pulling production records and showing them to people in a pilot, we had users identifying errors and corrections they wanted to make.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span> We try to anticipate for patients with varying degrees of proficiency. The PHR is not to be a requirement for patients, but an option. We do not assume any singular app/platform for anything. Patient has choice. We are working on patient friendly terms for all common SNOMED CT concepts. We have talks with medication database owners so they can provide APIs for additional information, the PHR UIs shall comply with rules for vision impaired people.</p>
<p>Things we could not solve: between age 12-16 there is a consent issue, health guardians are in an official registry without public access so there's no way to know who's in there and various other specialized cases (prisoners, mental unstable people, bastard off-the-record children mentioned in your EHR, ...). A thing we did not scope: if the patient has so much app choice: how does data portability work when he moves from appA to appB</p>
<p>I for now would be happy if we could get harmonization on how to approach use cases without considering all aforementioned possible exceptions. I very much liked how <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191678">@Abigail Watson</span> framed it using the pseudo code.</p>

<p>We didn't come far enough to know if a Bundle is useful, or maybe just upload each MedicationStatement. In any case it would be a FHIR solution from the patient perspective. It might get translated into something else to be entered in the EHR. From there, some reconciliation process would need to start, with an outcome that somehow makes it way back to the patient.</p>

<p>Maybe we just throw on a <code>_reconcile</code> parameter to the POST url to trigger the reconciliation process?  Also, the CapabilityStatement resource tracks <code>interaction</code> field.  This may be a significant enough use case to justify a new <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-restful-interaction.html#4.3.14.177.2" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-restful-interaction.html#4.3.14.177.2">top-level interaction</a>.  How about 'reconciliation' as a top level interaction?  A system can register that it supports reconciliation writes in the Capability Statements, and if they do, the patient can POST to the various endpoints using a _reconcile parameter (similar workflow to _history).  The receiving system can reconcile the receiving data however it wants.</p>

<p>A result of open client registration is that we get a TOOOOOON of junk registrations.  Without a vetting process, we have no idea which of the client registrations are  real apps and which are folks playing in our sandbox using Postman or Fiddler.  We have apps registrations with names like TestApp, Demo1, MyTestingApp, etc.  We could filter to those that have production API usage, but that doesn't tell the whole story because developers who are patients at organizations using Epic can create a client registration and use Postman/Fiddler to make production API calls using their personal accounts.    All this to say that one of the trade-offs of making client registration easier is that providing an accurate listing of real apps gets harder.</p>

<p>I think this thread has slowly derailed a little from its original intent, and I would like to get back to that intent or as far as I understood it to be. <br>
So DevDays US will be having a session on one example of what a patient API could look like. That's great, wish I could be there, but I'm not: please repeat that session in DevDays Amsterdam. Most importantly: it is good to explore different examples, but what we need is to find common ground for common use cases. This way, we would see more chances for vendor implementation to work across different countries with limited effort.<br>
Question remains: how do we organize this? Could this be part of an existing WG? Do we need a new one? So far we have national projects operating in national rooms where national participants may or may not look outside their project for how other people did the same thing. <br>
Problem:  interoperability between national projects is currently by accident, not by design. FHIR Core for as far as content is concerned would be a given, but whether or not you can get to that content depends on the workflow/API design.</p>

<p>If HL7 is not the right place for this I'll at least run into funding questions for F2F meetings.  I don't have that issue for WGM visits. You may still be right: I'm also in doubt. The whole notion of working on common ground for a broader use case really feels like IHE territory, even if the patient is not currently really in their scope.<br>
To give the whole thing some body I'd like to see commitment from at least Argonaut, and HL7 IPS. I'd happily contribute for MedMij (NL). I've seen more patient oriented groups in this thread that I didn't know of before like CARIN: broader is better at least in startup phase.<br>
What I think our deliverables could be is to extend from the basic guidance given here <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/usecases.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/usecases.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/usecases.html</a> and work on IGs containing (workflow) patterns around such use cases. We could also find there's spinoff work in spotting harmonization potential in local profiling (e.g. because there is or should be a core extension where a local extension is). From that spinoff work we could also work on more localization guidance e.g. here <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html</a>.

<p>More generally, are you saying that nobody has defined a patient use case yet that is at all interesting?  (Has anyone?)  Has anyone tried to gather a group of patient-centered apps from other universes, which should become interested in FHIR?  Should I shut up until someone says it's consumer-time?

<p>It is good to explore different examples, but what we need is to find common ground for common use cases. This way, we would see more chances for vendor implementation to work across different countries with limited effort.<br>
Question remains: how do we organize this? Could this be part of an existing WG? Do we need a new one? So far we have national projects operating in national rooms where national participants may or may not look outside their project for how other people did the same thing. <br>
Problem:  interoperability between national projects is currently by accident, not by design. FHIR Core for as far as content is concerned would be a given, but whether or not you can get to that content depends on the workflow/API design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned above, the Ring of FHIR and Clinicians on FHIR project are maybe relevant attempts at coordinating such efforts.  We could either set up a new group modeled after either of them, or we could submit Patient centric usecases to them, such as we (Symptomatic) did with the Clinician on FHIR and Blockchain on FHIR usecase PDFs.  </p>
<p>I'm trying to be careful about marketing and soliciting, because our use case documentation is effectively also our product brochure... but we have documents that fairly clearly spell out use cases for Data Fetch, Longitudinal Timeline, Data Reconciliation, Medical Home Management, Remote Patient Monitoring, Health ID, and others.  We also have the blockchain usecases, such as Health Passport, Patient Index, Organ Donor Registry, Consent Management, etc.  </p>
<p>In the near term, one immediate thing that needs to be harmonized are default test patients between EHR systems.  In effect, we need an IG that cross-pollinates some curated test patients across the different EHRs.  Something I'm hoping to discuss at the Montreal Working Group.</p>

<p>Ring of FHIR: I can only find something at HIMSS Jan 2019, but apparently it's more than that?</p>
<p>I like your notion of "Patients on FHIR" similar to "Clinicians on FHIR". Maybe what we do could be practical first rather than theoretical. When we have solid Connectathon scripts around one or more use cases, and find enough backing implementers that take those experiences 'home' to their local projects for input then that could fuel things in the right direction without becoming a new 'meeting club'. Those same scripts, advertised properly, could lead to patterns that people find useful without venturing into an arbitrary number of local projects which is what I do today.</p>

<p>Best of all: we'd be tapping into the Connectathon community/schedule that already exists, hence less extra organizational overhead to be expected. Working on getting the right scripts with the right depth/breadth and eventually generalizing them into something of an IG would require additional effort, it just might work by starting small.</p>

<p>It boils down to resources. We are all very busy with 'day-job' work. We would all love to carve out non-paid-for work, but there is not much time left in a day. I am not discouraged from working on patient centric use-cases, but there is only so much time left in a day. -- To be blunt, follow the money, there is money paying for all available resources to achieve business objectives, there is no money paying for patient objectives. Any movement you see on patient objectives is either influenced by business objectives (The VA has historically been a patient advocate), or is done out of the kindness of the individuals free-time.</p>

<p>Understood. MedMij certainly has funding and it solely concerns patients. I would hope any project has its funding worked out. What could be missing here and there is a project description that includes investing time in the community and/or a simple lack of awareness. </p>
<p>I certainly would not claim to know all projects around the world doing the same use cases we do. We look at things we know exist, use what we can, and adapt what we can't, work with the FHIR Core community on changes/additions to the core, but we don't normally go to Argonaut or SDC to ask for changes (tried once for SDC but SDC shifted to R4 and did not maintain STU3). We worked with you on MHD which was fruitful until (again) attention shifted to R4. Being a 'good local FHIR citizen' involves work with the international community. The less localization is needed, the better.</p>

<p>Boy, it's been almost two months since this thread brewed up a storm, and now here we are, headed to Seattle.</p>
<p>Given the seven-part blog series I've done (#8 tomorrow) leading into Seattle, and leading directly into patient needs for data access, is it time to stir this stewpot again, and see what all the chunks look like today?  </p>
<p>For those who haven't seen, I'll come back in a moment with a link to the blog thread (in the "Origin Story / blog posts" stream).</p>
