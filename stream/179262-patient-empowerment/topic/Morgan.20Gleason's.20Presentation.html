<p>I'm watching this presentation and wondering whether we should standardise something like "Patient Preparation note" (or something like that). That would help with writing an App. Also, this seems like a good workflow for a student challenge to take on (e.g. MIHIN challenge)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="311763">@Morgan Gleason</span> Agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> -- that was an excellent summary of the challenges many complex patients face in coordinating their care. Two questions: </p>
<ol>
<li>How would you rank the various features of your "dream app" in terms of priority? </li>
<li>Have you tried using any of the available patient apps (Apple Health, former HealthVault and former Google Health, etc.)? Were there features of those you found useful?</li>
</ol>

<p>I raised the question on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179160" href="/#narrow/stream/179160-social">#social</a>, but I'll ask here too - what's the resource to use for a "patient's questions they want answered during a session"?  Most of what was on <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="311763">@Morgan Gleason</span>'s document has a clear home, but I'm not sure about that bit.  It could be 'Goal', but that doesn't quite feel right, nor does Questionnaire.</p>

<p>I think so.  I'd want the records of them captured.  Perhaps Task?  It acts as a 'todo'.  It would also allow the answering of the questions to be delegated and to remain 'active' if they weren't answered during a session.</p>

<p>While I do imagine there are lots of places the individual data pieces already live, what Morgan is looking for is a way to present a patient summary that is generated by the patient/caregiver that focuses on different aspects of the whole picture. This turns into a lot more tools for highlighting and notating various aspects of the record as well as managing the routing and prioritization of different content for different providers.</p>

<p>I didn't see the presentation, but one potentially useful thing would be to start with the textual representation of "questions I want answered during a session", run it through NLP, then let the system/AI/Alexa/whatever process the questions according to best practices/similar-patients, and have this presented to the provider as a guide during the session...</p>

<p>Condition is something that is tracked over time.  It wouldn't necessarily correspond to a 'question'.  For example "I'm wondering if we can shift the dose or schedule of medication X because it's making me drowsy when I need to Y".  You could potentially capture the "Medication X makes me drowsy" as a Condition, but not the full question.</p>

<p>It can be, though that's often handled as Observation.  Key thing is that Condition isn't something that will have an 'answer', has an assigned responsibility of "who should answer" and the state machine doesn't really fit well for "awaiting answer" vs. "answered".  ("resolved" definition is "The subject is not presently experiencing the condition or situation and there is a negligible perceived risk of the condition or situation returning." which seems a weird state for "this question is now answered"...)</p>

<p>Thanks so much! I guess I would rank getting my appointment visit notes and radiology reports sent to my doctors and to me as first as at least that would solve the manual record requests and make sure that we all had the same information. Then, I would rank having my information aggregated and current second. Next, I would rank the summaries of the plan, and last I would rank combining it all with an issues list, reason for visit, reminders, extra details, etc.<br>
I have tried to use other apps, and the only one I found valuable isn’t made anymore. It was the only one that actually combined all the data and had all the details. I love the Apple Health one, but it keeps each healthcare doctor or site information separated from the rest. It also doesn’t get documents so it is missing the most important parts of information. It is also only as good as the patient portals are, which I have found to be pretty terrible - all 23 of them!</p>

<p>I think that the intent with Apple Healthkit is that an app could integrate information across providers. I suppose one such app exists but how to find it? (Apple have reps here so they might comment...)</p>

<p>Apple bought Gliimpse from Anil Sethi, which did exactly this. Then Anil left Apple and started Ciitizen to do it all over again so the focus could be back on complex patients. The Health app is, I agree useful, but not where it needs to be for what Morgan needs!</p>

<p>I'm watching this presentation and wondering whether we should standardise something like "Patient Preparation note" (or something like that). That would help with writing an App. Also, this seems like a good workflow for a student challenge to take on (e.g. MIHIN challenge)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It just thrills me that after all the thought &amp; work that's already gone into FHIR, this additional breakthrough-level concept can arise out of listening to what one young patient is already doing to manage her care.  </p>
<p>It validates the whole idea of having a patient innovator track, eh?</p>

<p>I raised the question on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179160" href="/#narrow/stream/179160-social">#social</a>, but I'll ask here too - what's the resource to use for a "patient's questions they want answered during a session"?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there a resource for a patient's goal or declared need - a "what I want"?  Seems to me that Goal in reality has long-term, short-term, and immediate flavors.</p>
<p>Goals also have many forms:  stop my knee from hurting; get my A1c below 5.8; be able to put my socks on while standing, at age 80; get doctor's advice on X ...  IMO <em>correctly</em> a goal needs to allow freeform text, but it needs to have a certain status as "What matters to the patient, in their own definition of well-being."</p>

<p>"Get doctor's advice on X" <em>could</em> be a goal, though that seems to me to be more a process step than a "desired end state".  Goal would be more "Have a good understanding of X".  Also, Goal doesn't have an ability to assign responsibility or capture an answer.</p>
<p>Goals can absolutely be patient-authored and can be free-text (or computably expressed or both).  There's also a standard extension that allows you to capture 'acceptance' of a goal - so patients can indicate whether they agree with (or not) a goal set by a practitioner or caregiver (e.g. parent, child); or for that matter, a practitioner can indicate whether they're on board with (or not) a goal set by a patient.</p>

Aha!  Now we get deliciously into how we'll have to train people like Morgan (but also many providers) to think.  Many times I've been asked "What are your goals for this visit?"  Indeed IMO what we think of as a goal for one time zoomed-in event may just be in pursuit of one process step in a less-zoomed-in scope. </p>
<p>So I'll back off on specifics and just note that our overall purpose for this discussion is to help make health/care more effective by weaving patient need/wants/perspectives into the fabric of everything we do. Yes?</p>

<p>That's my understanding too, but <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="311964">@Ross Martin</span> almost without fail knows more than me, so when he talked about both in the same breath, I wanted to be sure we were all on the same page. <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span> </p>
<p>So, to fulfill Morgan's desire to pull everything together as needed, the app of her dreams would talk to Health<strong>Kit</strong>, which is the doorway to all data on the device, some of which may also be visible in the Health <strong>app.</strong> Is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> I think my “Items to Discuss” section is more of a to do list or agenda than a goal. It kind of seems forced to put it in the goal. I do also think goals are important, and I used to have them on my summary. However, I found that the items to discuss was more pointed to the visit. My goals didn’t seem to change much and weren’t discussed very much in my visits so I removed it. I have tried to keep it as short as possible.</p>

<p>Most EHRs today organize the patients clinical data by "Encounters."  In other words, a group of data for each appointment.  If a patient happens to have a chronic condition, then they could easily have 100s of Encounters in their clinical history.  Currently, most EHRs require anywhere from 3-6 keystrokes at a minimum for the doctor to review the data from each patient Encounter Record.  If you multiply the number of keystrokes it takes the doctor to view a single Encounter for a patient times the number of Encounters describing a patient's clinical history, then it can easily take doctors hundreds to thousands of keystrokes just to review the patient's clinical history.  And, because of this most doctors don't have the time to do so.</p>
<p>When we extract the patients data into a Patient App and/or Patient System, then unless we do something to solve the problem, it will also burden patients with this same repetitive keystrokes pattern to review their own clinical records.</p>
<p>I personally would like to see us define an HL7 standard that enables Patients, Providers and Payers to  automatically "merge" all of the Patient's Encounters into a Master Patient Encounter with provenance for each data element.  Many people believe this alone would help reduce the current Provider error rates for both diagnosis and treatment decisions resulting in a reduction in unnecessary appointments, in the number of deaths due to errors and in medical expenses.</p>

<p>FHIR has an EpisodeOfCare resource which allows collecting all data across encounters (and outside encounters entirely) that is relevant to a given condition.  It also supports the List resource which allows currated (and ordered) views of any collection of resources desired (meds, problems, encounters, procedures, lab results, whatever.  Finally it has Composition which allows organizing collections of resources into a 'table of contents' where each section has narrative supporting the telling of a 'story'.  Those three resources provide a variety of ways of organizing and providing views into the record that are more efficient/useful than navigating encounters.  However, they can operate in parallel to encounters - because encounters too are useful organizers.  It's just important that they not be the only ones.  One of the challenges for systems now is to support better organization of data <em>across</em> systems, and that requires cultural change in addition to technical change.</p>

<p>EpisodeOfCare is low and CarePlan is still pretty minimalist.  The adoption of structures that support cross-organizational care coordination is unfortunately quite limited.  Much of the early FHIR implementation was focused on merely exposing the data systems already had - and cross-ogranizational care coordination wasn't something that had a lot of penetration.  As well, introducing external actors into workflow management of <em>any</em> kind of data creates all sorts of complexity, which isn't the sort of thing vendors are going to bite off first - especially if regulations don't make them.</p>

<p>But we to go with this? I think it would be awesome for someone to write an Apple health App that gathers this kind of information from health kit, allows a user to decide which to include in the document, write up their questions, and then store and submit to the provider electronically. (Obviously that anticipates some rather large clinical workflow changes). </p>
<p>The main reason I did this as a document is to feed it to orgs like MIHIN who run app development challenges - it seems like a really good way to spread the idea, a good project scope wise for some that are running. It if has legs, it might be worth the Patient Empowerment Group writing it as a formal spec (based on USCDI / IPS) on the grounds that the information should usually be gathered from the sources. </p>

A well formed Composition would enable manual navigation but also automated processing. Where automated processing could make the data look integrated and related. Lots of opportunity to use the FHIR standard and do something greater upon it.</p>

<p>Task: </p>
<ul>
<li>There was no match for any of the values for intent or status</li>
<li>there was no remotely relevant code </li>
<li>I didn't think the question was really the description</li>
</ul>
<p>For those reasons, It just didn't feel like 'issues I want to discuss as part of my appointment' are right for the Task resource. Other than that, it felt like a comfortable fit, though I expect people would fight like cats and dogs over the sections and section headings</p>

<p>intent would be 'order' (it's something being asked for).  status would be 'requested' (no one's agreed to provide an answer yet.<br>
No relevant code isn't a surprise.  We'd have to define one.<br>
For the question, we have a few choices - description, code.text, focus.description or task.input.  My leaning is for the code to be "please answer" or "please discuss" and not to convey the question.  If we had the question itself as a 'resource', then Task.focus would be the right location.  However, given that isn't, I think description is fine.  Though I might phase it as "To discuss: Having issues with JM rash, arm weakness, fatigue, nausea. I am concerned because I had to delay my infusions due to Covid"</p>

<p>Thanks, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193764">@Ricky Bloomfield</span> ... so is HealthKit nothing but an API to data stored in the Health app, or is it vice versa - the Health app is a viewer/editor for the data in HealthKit?

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197491">@Dave deBronkart</span> - perhaps it's best to think of HealthKit as a system framework in iOS that consists of an API and a data store. Because of the security features of iOS, apps generally can't access the data within the "sandbox" of another app. System frameworks are designed to allow apps to interact in secure ways, and HealthKit is one example of this - apps can read/write to the HealthKit database with user consent. The Health app can be thought of as a 1st-party way to view/edit the data in the HealthKit database.</p>

The majority of my devices were implanted at an AMC using Epic. I have yet to have a medical encounter where the device information has been readily available. Last month I had to put yet another cut and paste package together of my device info and tesla ratings for an imaging center so I could get an MRI.  I've had to do this at least 5 times over the years. If the info is somewhere in the record it is not bubbling to the surface.  The fastest way to get it is on cath lab reports, but those records just say what was implanted and doesn't have the associated product information  necessary for imaging.</p>

<p>The Patient Empowerment's work group 'home' on Confluence is here: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PE/Patient+Empowerment+Home">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PE/Patient+Empowerment+Home</a>.  That contains information about our regular conference calls.  However it's also <em>here</em> - on Zulip.  So even if our regular call time doesn't work for you, you can read the meeting minutes on Confluence and post thoughts/feedback here.</p>

<p>I'm watching this presentation and wondering whether we should standardise something like "Patient Preparation note" (or something like that). That would help with writing an App. Also, this seems like a good workflow for a student challenge to take on (e.g. MIHIN challenge)</p>
<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="311763">Morgan Gleason</span> - thanks - that's nice work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could see this as an independent student project as well.  I am connected with students through my university and  I am sure other HL7 members could identify students looking to learn more about HL7, standards, and get some hands on experience. Does HL7 have a location to consolidate these types of projects and ideas, and facilitate getting students involved?</p>
