<p>I notice that <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=491" target="_blank" title="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=491">the FHIR button on the HL7 home page</a> leads directly to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>
FHIR is an interoperability standard intended to facilitate the exchange of healthcare information between organizations. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his closing talk I think I heard <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> say that the <strong>purpose</strong> of exchange between organizations was for patient benefit; and I know we're discussing (in the #Work-Group-Proposal thread) adding items to the spec that explicitly state the patient value of various things. </p>
<p>Should we edit that description, adding "for patient benefit"?  Whatever wording is chosen should make it difficult for weasels to weasel out :-) e.g. by claiming "I made this decision FOR you, for your benefit" :-)   (But don't laugh; it's an ongoing argument.)</p>
<p>The "first time here?" block at the top of <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir">hl7.org/fhir</a> will also need a patient summary, to go along with the Executive Summary, Architect's Introduction, etc. </p>
<p>Is this work for the nascent Patient Perspectives Work Group, or whatever it will be called?</p>

<p>writing a patient cover sheet is definitely for the patient group to do.</p>

<p>I'll chase down the 'between organizations' thing - that's wording for HQ and it's never actually been true</p>
