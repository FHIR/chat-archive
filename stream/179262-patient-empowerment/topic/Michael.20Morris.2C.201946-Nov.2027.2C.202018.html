<p>Here is his obituary. Oddly (to me) it describes him as an attorney, not a developer, but it certainly seems to be him. <a href="https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?n=michael-morris&amp;pid=190894039&amp;fhid=2782" target="_blank" title="https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?n=michael-morris&amp;pid=190894039&amp;fhid=2782">https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?n=michael-morris&amp;pid=190894039&amp;fhid=2782</a> </p>
<p>I hope the work he created will not be lost, so I posted an inquiry on the Curesoft site's contact form to see if anyone responds.  If not, the obituary lists numerous names to try.</p>
<p>(If he was primarily an attorney it underscores that his work didn't require being a career developer.)</p>

<p>Oh wow, so sad to see this (and only seeing this now), I thought we was doing better back in November! <span aria-label="sad" class="emoji emoji-2639" role="img" title="sad">:sad:</span></p>

<p>All, FYI - last month I got this message from Mike's business partner Dan Fobes <a href="mailto:dan@curesoft.com" title="mailto:dan@curesoft.com">dan@curesoft.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mike and I worked together deploying monitoring solutions for data centers then turned our focus to cancer patients which is how Curesoft came about. </p>
<p>I’m working with Mike’s family to continue the mission of Curesoft. We all believe this could be the foundation for healthcare and how cancer patients are treated. Mike and I started this about 3 years ago after he was diagnosed, and my dad had just passed with an almost identical diagnosis as Mike. </p>
<p>Hope to have updates soon. </p>
