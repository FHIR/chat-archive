<p>The call for presentations is open for 12 more days (ends Feb 1), and I'm thinking that the patient activist community out there might really enjoy a session aimed at them.  Also, considering how much interest the patient track got from developers in Amsterdam, it might interest some in Cleveland.  So my instincts are telling me we should draft something. </p>
<p>Of course perhaps the scope of "we" might be "n=1," i.e. me.  But having lived my whole life as a soloist, I'm trying hard to grow a skill set with ensembles.  </p>
<p>Some might say "Why wait for Cleveland? Why not just publish something now?"  My instincts respond that it's both outbound and inbound: (a) to grow public awareness of DevDays as "a thing" in the world, and (b) to more actively weave citizen participation into DevDays itself. </p>
<p>We would blog some optional homework reading in advance about FHIR, and do some simple demonstrations like that thing I love where you type or paste in a URL and get back a piece of health data.  (I know that's trivial to YOU, but to the data-starved public it's miraculous, and will stimulate lots of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="251396">@John Keyes</span> imitators to start exploring.)</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Dave, I'd say go for it!  And, if you want some feedback and/or help, then please feel free to reach out.  I'm spending most of my waking hours these days working on solutions for patients.</p>
