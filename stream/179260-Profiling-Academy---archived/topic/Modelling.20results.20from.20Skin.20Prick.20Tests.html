<p>Hello! <br>
Ran into an issue that I thought I'd share to see if you have input. (Hope this is the right stream)</p>
<p>As a part of a IG I'm working on, I am modelling an allergy investigation based on among other things skin prick test and provocation.<br>
To communicate the results of the skin prick test, my thoughts were to use diagnostic report with observations, since the result of the test is a list of observations on sizes of possible rashes from the substances tested.</p>
<p>The problem is expressing; what is being observed (skin rash), size of skin rash, and the known causation substance.<br>
By using  Observation.partOf I can keep a reference to the procedure of the skin prick test, which in turn has a usedReference, but is this the right way to express this?</p>
<p>Feels like the Observation resource becomes a tad "thin", i.e. lacking in data.</p>
<p>I also looked at the option of using AllergyIntolerance but, seeing that we are communicating quantifiable measurements for clinical decision making, it did not seem quite correct.</p>
<p>As always, the problem is solvable with a extension here or mishandling Observation.compartment, but if there are less ambiguous ways of solving the problem, I'm all ears (eyes?).</p>
<p>Thoughts on this?</p>

<p>You might want to use a panel structure pattern to model the test (an Observation for the panel) and its member Observations (See the example at <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-example-vitals-panel.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-example-vitals-panel.html</a> ).</p>

<p>Yes, that would be another way of expressing the grouping, but I would still need to force one of my three data points in by extension on Observation. </p>
<p>The three data points being; skin rash which is the symptom being observed, the value as a quantitative measure or coding, and finally the known causation substance.</p>

<p>If the rash size and causative agent are not independent observations you could use something like.<br>
Observation.code=skin-rash-from-test<br>
Observation.component[0].code=rash-size<br>
Observation.component[0].valueCode=big<br>
Observation.component[1].code=rash-cause<br>
Observation.component[1].valueCode=egg</p>
