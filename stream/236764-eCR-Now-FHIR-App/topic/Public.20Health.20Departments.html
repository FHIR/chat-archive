<p>If a Public Health Department becomes FHIR enabled and can receive a FHIR push of the eICR document bundle, and can respond with the RR Communication, are there any additional dependencies on AIMS?  In other words, if a public health department wanted to integrate directly with a health system via FHIR messaging, could eCR Now be configured in its current state to accommodate this transport option?  I can't quite tell, but it looks like eCR Now would receive local PHA rules from the eRSD subscription, in addition to trigger code updates.  Is that accurate?</p>
