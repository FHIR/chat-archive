<p>Hello, I work for an HIE and we have been evaluating this application for our needs. I was wondering if anyone could share a resource of even a snippet for a Trigger match on a Condition that would result in ecir data being written. </p>
<p>I have a test patient, encounter, observation, and conditions set-up on <a href="https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/fhir">https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/fhir</a> and can verify that the application is working after stepping through the code. I am at a loss for what would trigger a report and was hoping someone could help</p>

<p>Sorry for the delayed response, The reports can be triggered in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>For COVID-19 there are specific codes in the value sets specified in the ersd bundle, so the codes that would trigger them could be observation codes, condition codes, diagnostic report codes etc. These value sets have limited set of values and it has to match them.</li>
<li>For Full eCR Reporting in general, the value sets are large and the codes that could be used for testing are many more. So you could use any of them to test.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are test data scenarios in the <a href="https://github.com/drajer-health/eCRNow/tree/master/documents">https://github.com/drajer-health/eCRNow/tree/master/documents</a> folder.<br>
(Connectathon Data.pdf).<br>
You could create your test data based on that and excercise the entire flow.</p>
<p>If you need any help, please let us know and we would be happy to help.</p>
