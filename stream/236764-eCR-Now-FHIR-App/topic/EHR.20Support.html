<p>Thanks for the amazing app and demo. Very helpful. I want to understand the support of EHR vendors for this app. I saw the Cerner sandbox in the demo. So, I believe the app will be pushed on Cerner  App Gallery soon. But what about Epic, eCW, Allscripts, Meditech, etc? Is there a plan to push the app for the respective EHR vendor app store as well? If yes, Do you have a timeline of when you see that happening? Thanks</p>

<p>Some of the vendors that you name are close to having a CDA eCR implementation and are choosing that path. We have reached out to all of them to team with us if not. We cannot support the vetting and support of the app in all of these different app stores or environments, so we are providing the app and it source code to EHR companies to implement.  Health systems and large medical centers could implement too.</p>

<p>Between rapid on-boarding of CDA eCR and providing the technology for FHIR eCR through the app, we hope that all EHRs will have approaches for COVID-19 eCR reporting soonest (eCR Now!).</p>

<p>Thanks John. Do you know what EHR support CAD eCRs? I know Epic does. Are you aware of others who do as well or are close to doing so?</p>
