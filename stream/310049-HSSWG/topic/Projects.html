<p>I figured this stream (sub-stream?) could be where we discuss possible projects. I know there were a couple that were already floating out there. One that I wanted to ask about (although I don't have much experience using it), has anyone looked into mapping <a href="http://docs.openreferral.org/en/latest/hsds/">HSDS</a> to FHIR? And would there be any value to this?</p>

<p>Grey, I like this idea as it seems like somthing we  could really accomplish in the first year and a valuable contribution. I look forward to hearing more!</p>

<p>Grey - I know you were going to reach out to Open Referral. Would it be helpful for <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="376858">@Sheetal Shah</span> to send an intro email for you and Greg Bloom who is the founder of the Open Referral Initiative? Greg has said that he wants to get involved with the HSS WG already.</p>
