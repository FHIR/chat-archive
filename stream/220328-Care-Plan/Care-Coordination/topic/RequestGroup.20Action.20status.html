<p>What would be the best way of keeping track of which actions in a request group have been completed?  There is a status on the higher level RequestGroup but not on the individual actions.  Am I abusing the notion of a RequestGroup to imagine that some of the actions might be complete and others are not yet done?</p>

<p>Requests in general don't track what actions have been done, they just track that an overall authorization is now withdrawn on the grounds that the request was sufficiently executed.  Tracking execution is handled by Task.  With a RequestGroup, the authorization status exists only at the group and, as such, the authorization is only marked as 'completed' when everything is done.</p>

<p>(or at least 'enough' of everything that the requester deems it 'complete')</p>

<p>Ok, this makes sense.  So I can track status by creating a task per RequestGroup action.  Then the Task.basedOn and/or Task.focus can point at the request group actions.</p>
