<p>Is there an existing library of care plans that can serve as reference templates for common chronic conditions like managing diabetes, hypertension, etc.?</p>
<p>I see that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span>  has made some references to this in his 2021 HIMSS talk <a href="http://hde.himss.org/sites/hde/files/handout-225_236.pdf">http://hde.himss.org/sites/hde/files/handout-225_236.pdf</a>  -- and I was curious if there are any public domain works in progress for this.</p>
<p>I guess people probably don't want to "prescribe" care plans due to liability, etc. -- but I'm also assuming that care plans shouldn't really differ much (in baseline content/structure) for well-known common conditions, and if there was a library of FHIR care plan resources to represent best practices for caring for such conditions, that could serve as great reference templates to incorporate into FHIR based apps. Could be a great open source project as well.</p>
<p>Will greatly appreciate any suggestions/pointers to any relevant work in progress.</p>

<p>If you look for Computable Care Guidelines you may find some interesting materials.</p>

<p>Also there is quite some work being develope by WHO and other organizations on guidelines, I don't know if they matter to you.</p>

<p>I don't know that there is a library of Plan Definitions, which I think is what you are looking for. As Jose points out there is implementation guides on how to create a library of Plan Definitions -- Computable Care Guidelines.</p>

<p>hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192382">@Sandeep Giri</span>   what you are asking for is, I think, what we are doing with WHO's SMART Guidelines here: <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/digital-health-and-innovation/smart-guidelines">https://www.who.int/teams/digital-health-and-innovation/smart-guidelines</a>   we have a few IGs out with CQL decision support following WHO recommendations.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192382">@Sandeep Giri</span>  -- the Government of Ontario's Cancer Care organization collaborated with Canada Health Infoway (Canada's national digital health agency) and Hamilton Health Sciences (a large Canadian research hospital organization) on a computable care guideline (CCG) for <strong>lung cancer screening</strong>. This was an early CCG prototype. It was developed by a team that is very active in the WHO SMART Guideline efforts Carl and Bryn are referring to. Their prototype can be found here: <a href="https://simplifier.net/guide/lungcancerdiagnosiscomputablecareguidline/introduction">https://simplifier.net/guide/lungcancerdiagnosiscomputablecareguidline/introduction</a>.</p>

<p>thanks, everyone - this is super helpful</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191604">@Carl Leitner</span> will WHO's Smart Guidelines be developed all internally or can outside collaborators contribute as well? IOW, if a clinic or public health organization wants to build and share CCGs in public domain (and perhaps even their efficacy metrics if possible), is there are recommended way for them to work with SMART Guidelines?</p>
