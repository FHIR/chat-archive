<p>I'm looking at the PlanDefinition$apply operation. In my case, I have a PlanDefinition that applies to most of the subjects in my population. My question is how have people implemented or what is the guidance on implementing $apply and returning a CarePlan which does not apply to the subject? The specification indicates that I return a CarePlan with a single activity that is a RequestGroup. But if the CarePlan does not apply to the passed in subject, how should I represent that? Is changing my return value from CarePlan to OperationOutcome appropriate? Also, from an http status perspective, would 404 be appropriate as the result wasn't found or would 200/204 be more appropriate since the operation succeeded, it just did not happen to apply to my subject?</p>

<p>I would think that the appropriate response would be an "empty" CarePlan, as in, there's nothing to do. You may want to provide additional rationale for that, perhaps in the description element or a note, to say that the service produced no guidance fpr this patient because they did not meet the inclusion criteria (or that they did meet the exclusion criteria), but a CarePlan that says "nothing to do because X" still seems like a useful (and successful) result.</p>
