<p>In CarePlan, how do I capture loss to follow up? Patient was following a plan, but in July they somehow abandoned it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Did the patient die (e.g. the plan was in progress and the patient died)? Once a patient dies and the date/time of death is documented, most users do not continue to document  on-going aspects of the plan. </li>
<li>Was the plan ever started (surgical plan but the patient changed their mind)?  If so, in this case the status element can be used and if a different plan was decided on, the existing plan can be replaced by the new plan. </li>
<li>Was the entire plan started and then patient decided to abandon the plan? There has to be a follow-up plan where negotiation occurs or it's documented that the patient is refusing specific care (activities) or transition to other care modalities (which can include self-care), etc. </li>
</ol>
<p>What you're asking is situational, in which case, a lot of variances can occur. If a patient was following a plan and it somehow got abandoned without  some sort of indication of what happened next can be a form of negligence.</p>

<p>I think it will be helpful for you to look at the FHIR Goal Resource (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/goal.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/goal.html</a>) Be sure to look at the extensions as well so you can fully see how "Goal" elements , attributes and extensions are really what can bring the FHIR Care Plan together (which does kinda replicate the Care Planning in the real world). In a project I was working on - in our goal profiles, we required or Must supported the following things:<br>
Goal.measure (Required) Bound to it’s relevant goal target value set<br>
Goal.expressedBy (Must Support)<br>
Goal.addresses (Must Support)<br>
Goal.outcomeReference (Must Support)<br>
Goal.extension:goal-acceptance (Must Support)<br>
Goal.extension:reasonRejected (Must Support)<br>
Goal.extension:goal-relationship (Must Support)<br>
In addition your resource instances should leverage the resource-pertainsToGoal extensionto relate a resource to its goal.</p>

<p>Workflow is never a simple thing, but in FHIR I think we have good mechanisms. But CarePlan is missing a few parts, I think.</p>

<p>so, assuming that CarePlan is a "task-y" resource in the sense that it can represent a request/plan as well as events from its execution,  this could be a simple thing on the CarePlan - either some elements to say "Abandoned (+when/why)", or perhaps a special activity detail code.. <br>
But this goes to the other question - if CarePlan is able to follow requests and events, we should have a clear way to convey the events - planned or not.</p>

<p>CarePlan.activity.plannedActivityDetail allows you to mark something as stopped or cancelled.  The statusReason would allow you to capture 'why'.  I don't think a CarePlan is intended to reflect all activities undertaken, only those that were planned.  You can't query the CarePlan and expect to get the whole patient history.</p>

<p>not all activities, but what about those that become relevant like adrenalin administration, or abandoning treatment, or something else that is important? If not part of the plan, where would this be?</p>

We should not have to limit to only activities that are planned. To Jose's point, we need to be able to track activities that were "done", "not yet done", "not going to get done".</p>

<p>Sure.  What I'm saying is that you wouldn't <em>typically</em> include activities 'done' if they had never been planned in the first place.  I.e. A CarePlan isn't a record of everything that occurred, merely everything that was planned to occur (and whether it happened as planned or not).  That doesn't mean you couldn't update a careplan to include unplanned activities, just that it wouldn't be typical/expected.</p>

<p>To me, CarePlan is 'I'm thinking of potentially issuing a request'. That's very, very, early in the 'task' workflow. as soon as you create a Request/Task in an executable status, they're no longer part of the CarePlan, they'd move over to EpisodeOfcare, and the 'I'm thinking of potentially issuing a request' part of the CarePlan would be deleted from it. That'd be my expectation.</p>

<p>If we allow for 'event' resources to be part of CarePlan, then why would we have EpisodeOfcare ? EpisodeOfCare (IMHO) has a wider scope than CarePlan, EpisodeOfCare could 'include' CarePlan(s), not the other way around.

<p>activity.performedActivity, used to capture the outcome of a planned activity, does indeed muddle the issue. That, and plannedActivityDetails.status does lead me to think that apparently scheduled activities aren't removed from a CarePlan, but are kept on record as being part of a CarePlan.  <br>
So we'll certainly need guidance around "If one records a care event, when would this be recorded to be part of a CarePlan, and when as part of an EpisodeOfCare ?"</p>

<p>I think of Episode of Care to be more limiting contextually than CarePlan - at least in the context of how "episodeOfCare" is typically used by EHRs (and for payment purposes). For example, an inpatient admission with follow-up home care  services may make up one episode of care. A year later, if the patient is admitted for another inpatient stay and follow up homecare services that is a second completely different "episode of care". Even billing occurs based on this context. Whereas with care planning, the patient may have a chronic illness that may end up needing multiple episodes of care that can occur as long as the patient has the illness and planning occurs to deal with the illness. The main need for care plan is to collect and coordinate the various care processes (which contain "episodes of care").</p>

<p>I agree that one of the problems with Encounter and EpisodeOfCare is that its usage varies enormously given a particular context/country, and that it would be difficult to provide universal guidance. In some settings a Chronic Illness has exactly 1 EpisodeOfCare associated with it. CarePlans could be short term, or long terms, or could be comprised on multiple other (smaller) CarePlans. <br>
The discussions is around the fundamental nature of these resources, when would one be used versus where another ? In general we should be able to provide (better) guidance around this.</p>

<p>I think what Lloyd said is important; "You can't query the CarePlan and expect to get the whole patient history" (same goes for EpisodeOfCare). But the CarePlan _can_ be used as a record, with more context than either EpisodeOfCare, Encounter or simpler resources (typically: Observation),  as shown by the inclusion of e.g. activity.outcome[CodeableConcept/Reference]. And personally, I think this is potentially a useful richer context for the record - and I'm not too fond of putting that responsibility to EpisodeOfCare. But like you say, René, this could be made clearer, because at the moment CarePlan is described (in Scope and Usage) only as a request resource.<br>
I would be happy to hear you expand on these thoughts <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> (sorry if you have expressed most of it already, but here's possibly a new context <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span> for the same ideas).</p>
