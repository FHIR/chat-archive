<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="220253">@Khalid Shahin</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191506">@Yunwei Wang</span> The FHIR Management Group suggested the Evidence Resource is within the scope of FHIR (health data) but the Citation Resource may be beyond the scope of FHIR. The EBM community clearly needs Evidence and Citation Resources for its domain. There could be 3 overlapping domains:<br>
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) -- broad domain of health data that includes Evidence Resources<br>
Fast Evidence Interoperability Resources (FEvIR) - broad domain of scientific knowledge that includes Citation and Evidence Resources<br>
Literature And Science Interoperability Resources (LASIR) -- broader domain of literature that includes Citations for many things beyond scientific literature -- LASIR is just a made-up acronym for this concept</p>
<p>The EBM community is currently focused on this FEvIR domain (which is more targeted than FHIR or LASIR) and has advanced its preparation for interoperability tremendously through the great contributions of HL7 and FHIR.  We welcome the most expedient and supportive method to continue these efforts as we maintain "FEvIR Resources" that can be interoperable with FHIR Resources to enable exchange both WITHIN and BEYOND the FHIR domain.  </p>
<p>Initial searches for SDOs do not find a SDO more suitable for scientific knowledge reporting than HL7 and we would like to re-use the 'FHIR model' as it has been effective to solve these big challenge, even if the extensions are not literally or officially "FHIR"</p>
<p>We are just now starting a nonprofit organization (Scientific Knowledge Accelerator Foundation) and could use that as appropriate to coordinate with HL7 to extend the effort to areas beyond the scope of HL7.</p>

<p>First - awesome acronyms :)<br>
I think there'll certainly be support within the community for finding away to construct a parallel but dependent standard that's owned outside HL7 but interfaces tightly with FHIR.  I'd encourage you to also look at IEEE.  They've got quite a bit of stuff in the publication arena, but also have some background in data exchange standards.  Realistically, scientific literature standards may be a bit too tangential to them as well though.</p>

<p>From FMG's meeting note, there is not decision yet.</p>

<p>What about BibTeX, PubMed, Dublin Core, <a href="https://citationstyles.org/">https://citationstyles.org/</a>,</p>

<p>Thanks, John -- the intro to <a href="http://citationstyles.org">citationstyles.org</a> is really helpful to see how thousands of journals have open source software to convert their article metadata to journal-specific citation summary styles.  We are doing that for computable publishing style of Citation from FHIR json format now and this will help with cross-walk for that publishing community.  However the CSL efforts appear highly focused on journal-style literature and we need to support citations for many types of things not reported in these forms.  We have incorporated considerations from the other shemas (eg PubMed and Dublin Core) into our overall development already.</p>

<p>Would one combined use of Provenance and Citation be when a new FHIR resource X is created and inputs to the activity that created X included a work from outside FHIR described in a Citation resource? For example where a clinician uses some FHIR resources as measurement evidence, coupled with knowledge described in a journal or such.  If so, then would it be good to express this as a specific use-case where the two work together to achieve a result?<br>
Thus<br>
Provenance.entity.what would be a reference to the Citation<br>
Provenance.entity.role would need to be a new code to indicate the role that the Citation played in the activity. Seems we would need a new code?</p>

<p>Sounds like that could work and you could use Provenance.entity.role="source" -- the thing you are Citing is the source rather than a direct human source, but the report that you are citing is the role of source in this example.  the knowledge described in a journal is another source of knowledge in the creation of the work this is Provenance about.</p>
