<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="209510">@Larry Babb</span>  / <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196626">@Mullai Murugan</span> - Would you be interested in sharing the final outcomes of your work with CG sometime in the near future?  Either as an email summary with links to the list serv, as part of an upcoming CG call, or perhaps both?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191913">@Kevin Power</span>  Larry and I discussed this during our weekly call and are happy to share our final implementation plan and bring up some open questions during a CG call.</p>

<p>That's great! If Mondays are easier than Tuesdays, we should have some time either next week (8/26) or the one after Labor Day (9/9)</p>

<p>I have a slight preference to do this on a Tuesday call, but very slight.  Let Jamie and I know what Tuesday or Monday works best for you in the coming weeks.  Our Working Group Meeting (in person) starts the week of Sept 16, so if we could have it before then, that would be great.</p>
