<p>Regarding the Associate Phenotype Component element in the Inherited Disease Pathogenicity profile, there are instances when we have multiple phenotypes associated with a pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic variant.  Can the cardinality of 0..1 be expanded to 0..* to accommodate these use cases?</p>
<p>Also, is there a planned valueset to be used for the associated phenotypes? The current draft lists this as unbound.</p>

<p>I think making it 0..* makes sense.  You could also send multiple Observations as well, one for each phenotype - but that seems clunkier.</p>
<p>We discussed possible value sets for phenotypes, but it seems there are multiple options.  Do you have suggestions?</p>

<p>If you have a Variant observation, and that variant is Pathogenic for 3 phenotypes (assuming that is possible right?) - the question is is that 4 observations (1 variant, 3 inherited disease path (IDP) that all .deriveFrom() the variant )?  Or 2 (1 variant, 1 IDP that lists all 3 phenotypes and .derivesFrom() the variant)?</p>

<p>I think it has to be option 1 (i.e. keep phenotype 0..1 and use multiple pathogenicity observations) as the links will potentially have different levels of evidence to keep track of.</p>

<p>It is true that the reporting lab could report this as two separate assertions or interpretations, but there will always be folks that need to use multiple phenotypes to characterize the "condition" that the pathogenic interpretation is related too. Pragmatically, there will be labs that aggregate multiple diseases/phenotypes because the evidence is nearly the same and the outcome interp is the same for several diseases (as in the case above). We need to allow labs to report it as they're systems are capable of doing so. So, changing the cardinality of the "associated phenotype" component fro 0..1 to 0..* seems quite necessary.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span> I'm not sure I understand what you mean by levels of evidence. I don't think there's a terrible outcome if folks pass multiple phenotypes/diseases for a given variant interpretation in a diagnostic observation.  We will absolutely need it in situations where there isn't a perfect single id for the phenotype or disease or condition being assessed (yes, it happens). Sometimes geneticists or assessments are made and the best the reporting lab can do is offer a set of phenotypes or a couple of diseases that may be an either-or or a both-and situation for the interpretation. <br>
I think we could add some comment to the profile's field that says when you use multiple phenotypes you are assuming to state that all of the phenotypes together identify the condition being assessed or interpreted, they are not intended to be mutually exclusive or separate.  If so, then you should consider providing two separate interpretations, one for each separate disease (even if the evidence and final interpretation is identical).</p>

<p>To be transparent, we have some work to do around the 'evidence-level' component - in concept it is fine, but not sure how successful we will be finding a common way to represent it.</p>
<p>Also <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="209510">@Larry Babb</span> -- Regarding the different IDP instances for each Phenotype, I am not sure why you would say <code>it won't work all the time</code>?  It may not be ideal, but it would work in that you would be able to structure what you need to send right?  You just have to send as multiple Observations (1 per phenotype), and keep everything else the same.  Or am I missing a point?</p>
<p>Having said all that, making it 0..* adds flexibility, and if everything else is the same for multiple diseases, we should allow it.  Mullai posted an example (Mar 20 in this thread).</p>

<p>Thank you for the pointers to the evidence-level component. I am trying to sort out how that would work for the var pathogenicity interps being reported. (I may need to speak with you guys on this as I am not quite understanding it from the links you sent.)</p>
<p>In regards to the phenotype issue, I think there's still a miscommunication going on.  Here it is...</p>
<p>Occasionally, there are situations where a single phenotype term does not exist to define an acceptable representation of the condition that is caused by a given variant.  If you look in ClinVar you will find a number of interpretations that have multiple conditions/phenotypes/diseases (all the same thing - for our purposes here).  When this occurs we need to allow the reporting lab to group more than one phenotype to create a custom composite condition that best represents the condition that the variant is associated with.  If you break this up into separate observations it would be perceived as independent assertions  that the variant causes  each phenotype without a dependency on the other, when in fact the reporting lab wants to be able to say "this set of phenotypes occur all together in relation to the causality of the variant".  </p>
<p>I realize that the example we provided from Baylor may be the case where Baylor simply lumped two different conditions that are essentially the same thing because they found evidence for each independently related to the same variant. So, this may be causing the confusion. Folks will continue to provide a list of "similar" or "independent" items, but we should add guidance (as ClinVar does on its submission) to break up the assertions based on the independently assessed conditions, whether they be a single term or a collection of co-occurring terms.</p>

<p>you can wade through clinvar to find many examples of individual assertions/submissions/interpretations made by clinical testing labs that have multiple phenotypes.  Here are a couple I identified for you to peruse<br>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/523247/#clinical-assertions" target="_blank" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/523247/#clinical-assertions">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/523247/#clinical-assertions</a><br>

probably the best example is here from the LMM<br>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/53685/#clinical-assertions" target="_blank" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/53685/#clinical-assertions">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/53685/#clinical-assertions</a>   (SCV000271348.2)<br>
To read the lab's full text interpretation which should provide evidence that the clinical lab wants to convey an alternative or milder form of Cystic Fibrosis (no single disease/pheno code) when interpreting a finding for this pathogenic variant in a patient<br>
go to this tab on the clinvar variant page <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/53685/#summevdesc1" target="_blank" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/53685/#summevdesc1">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/53685/#summevdesc1</a><br>
and click on the "Full description" link in the rightmost column labeled "Description" for the "Laboratory for Molecular Medicine, Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine" row.<br>
I do agree that this is not super common, but it happens enough that we need to allow for it. If not then we have to have a much bigger discussion with the clinical lab folks to get them all to agree that they will never need to classify a causal interpretation on more than one phenotype at a time (seems unrealistic).</p>

Not clear which is intended. This record would be sent with two independent diseases.</p>

Submission accession is a grouper, but again how the conditions relate to each other within a submission is not clear.     <br>

This is not about what conditions the patient has but what conditions have been associated with a change at a specific position in some patient's genome. So, we need a model for knowledge. ClinVar includes evidence, and the summary page has several fields that are useful. Also, the entries demonstrates a need for a model of inherited condition that includes inheritance pattern. These fields exist in the profile but are linked to a specific phenotype by the use of cardinality of 1 for the phenotype component.         </p>
<p><strong>If we change associated phenotype to have * then we should move inheritance pattern, dr-relatedArtifact, evidence into the component. OR we need to provide guidance that one should only put in multiple phenotypes/conditions if all the attributes of source and evidence are the same.</strong>  </p>
<p>Note the LOINC code for the component is 81259-4, it has not restrictions on what value set can be used for “the possible phenotype associated with the genetic variant found in this study” Also the LOINC code is in trial, might be able to get the wording to be clearer.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span> I'm still confused (I think). </p>
<p>When reporting molecular diagnostic interpretations, folks often confuse the notion that the lab is providing a diagnosis or making a direct statement about the condition of the patient/subject. It isn't.  It IS saying that a clinically significant variant has been found in the patient based on the regions sequenced and analyzed by the diagnostic methodology used.  But to arrive at the point where the lab determines to report on an identified variant found in the sequencing portion of the test (that is to say it is either "clinically significant" or "uncertain as to its significance" or even "benign but interesting because its novel"), the lab will research the variant independent of the patient to gather evidence that can support or refute its pathogenicity for a genetic condition (well defined or specific) that is in the same domain as the indication for testing.  It may not be a condition that the patient has. The "molecular interpretation" or "inherited disease pathogenicity" result is a related assertion about the variant that happened to be found in the patient. It is not stating that the patient has the disease or will have the disease/condition.</p>
<p>The labs that create their own assertions (like those that they submit to ClinVar) reuse this patient independent information to share with providers when a patient is found to have that variant and a related indication.  </p>
<p>So, we need to be able to allow the labs to convey a "genetic condition" in any form they want. While its a nice idea to restrict them to OMIM or Orphanet or DOID or MeSH or UMLS or SNOMED or other coded diseases, these genetic conditions aren't always cleanly defined and available. So, from time to time, the clinical lab feels more comfortable reporting a set of disease/phenotypes to lump or split the available options.  There is a continual domain level effort going on in ClinGen and the community to allow expert groups to lump and split diseases and request that the authoring systems like omim, mondo (monarch initiative), doid, orphanet, etc... will generate codes when they are needed. But the state of genetic conditions is still quite volatile. </p>
<p>This is one of the main reasons we can't simply say "let's use snomed codes for genetics" or "let's just use OMIM".</p>
<p>I realize that folks will misuse it, but I don't think that's our concern. We are a "guide" and a specification to "enable" the ability to report what is needed to be reported. </p>
<p>In the end, I'm fine if you leave it as a cardinality of 1. We can always provide our own extensions if necessary in order to get the job done.</p>

<p>This is way out of my league. I would have to defer to the clinical geneticists that report these interpretations based on sets of phenotypic features/diseases. </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span> what is the harm in allowing multiple phenotypes? It seems that i most of the modeling work we air on the side of flexibility to cover a broad set of use cases (some would argue so broad that it begins to loose the simplicity needed for adoption - but I digress).  </p>
<p>I'm unclear as to why this is a sticking point. If we can cite 100s of records in ClinVar with interpretations that are developed and used by clinical testing labs that have multiple diseases/phenotypes, then why isn't that sufficient evidence to loosen the 0..1 constraint?</p>
<p>At this point, I'm fine with the decisions that the CG IG group makes and am not likely to continue spending additional time and effort on this issue as we are in a place that we need to do something that deviates from the draft model, so we will find a way to do it. </p>
<p>I do appreciate your thoughtful and in depth responses and requests for more clarity. I would defer to other resources that may have opinions or insights on this matter. If they do not concur with how ClinVar allows interpretations to have multiple diseases/phenotypes on a single record or feels that ClinVar is not a representative model for how clinical reporting of genetic interpretation then I would say that this issue should be closed.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span> thanks for the clarification. And, I agree with your concern regarding combining diseases with combined observations that are different. I'm pretty sure that is not the case. It is much more likely that some/most of the multiple disease assertions are situations where both diseases satisfy the single interpretation and it should be two separate interpretations. However, lots of folks struggle with the number of disease authorities and potential for similar or nearly similar diseases, so they tend to put multiple to make sure that all groups understand that either is appropriate for their interpretation.</p>

<p>no problem. the change means one would be able to send  one profile instance with multiple entries for each database (system), or one could send each database reference in a separate profile instance. I'm almost done with some examples, hope you will comment on them.</p>

<p>I have a question about the relatedArtifact. </p>
<p>I see in the FHIR docs that "type" is required, but you use "reference" which I presume is how you deal with the "resource" attribute in the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/metadatatypes.html#RelatedArtifact" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/metadatatypes.html#RelatedArtifact">RelatedArtifact </a>. In any case, I think type should be used and it should probably be any one of (justification|derived-from|citation). I also presume you lumped the comma separated list of pubmed ids so that you did not have to write out all 10 references. I don't think the comma-delimited list would be considered a single reference (if you disagree please discuss).  Finally, for precision, in case others are using this. I would have made the "clinvar" reference a type='justification' for sure and used a url that would have more precisely linked it to the SCV record SCV000271348.2 with version so that it clearly points to the LMM submission and is not mistaken for the entire set of assertions associated with variation ID <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/53685/#clinical-assertions" target="_blank" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/53685/#clinical-assertions">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/53685/#clinical-assertions</a>.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="209510">@Larry Babb</span> The data-type is reference meaning a refering to an URI or URL. The pubmed ids were in the URL as a commadelimited list - so it's a valid URL string (which just so happens to eliminate the need to use multiple URLs - thanks pubmed). Can you point me to the 'type' you mean? I think you don't mean data-type, right?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="209510">@Larry Babb</span>  is correct. The example needs the Type field with a value of 'citation' for the pubmed reference in the related artifact elements. Agree with the use of type=justification.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192123">@Bret H</span> I guess you won't be able to use RelatedArtifact for the SCV reference since it requires a URL. It does raise an interesting point if you'd like to be able to relate an artifact that is not dereference-able with a URL you will be out of luck.  I think the SCV could be treated as a coding type with a system and value of "ClinVar" and "SCV000271348.2" but that does not help us with RelatedArtifact. Maybe this is a case where some RelatedArtifacts are simply general pointers that contain the true source of "justification" that the producer of the record is trying to reference. I suppose this approach runs the danger of consumers of the information reading too much into what is meant by the relatedArtifact, but then that would be a consumer issue I suppose.</p>
<p>On a related note, we (ClinGen and GA4GH) are continuing to sort out standards around linking structured evidence that supports assertions (like statements of pathogencity) where supporting and (refuting) evidence is more precisely communicated. I think this is likely out of scope for FHIR at this time (maybe the CDS or CQI workgroups will be tackling this eventually).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="209510">@Larry Babb</span>  is there no way to access the SCV record? you don't need to use a url. The document could be attached or use the link in the related artifact to a profile that has the details of where the record is.  Regards statements of pathogenicity - I do hope you'll look at the components in the observation example for inherited disease. The components are quite useful and are meant to cover the area. But based on what you are describing, a profile for guidlines might fit the bill. But the profile is meant to be used as part of clinical pathways, so it might not be perfect. Totally agree that CDS and CQI groups could benefit from input in creating knowledge artifacts for genetic knowledge - be really awesome if the NLM took on the responsibility of maintaining a repository of public knowledge. We'll have to get used to not including the evidence in the documentation sent to the EMR - references in FHIR are awesome (check out URIs in the FHIR spec - you specify the endpoint, profile name and ID). If ClinGen used that for their records then using SCV000271348.2  would be a snap. It would be better than having to use components to accomplish the task. What you will get is a link from the observation to the supporting knowledge artifacts.  Love to see EMERGE at the connectathon or at a break-out session. Do you know if anyone is coming?</p>

<p>RE: components of inh-dis-path and obsVariant profiles (and others)...<br>
I have looked them over very carefully. I do think that they offer tons of flexibility in allowing users to represent complex observations using a broad group of attributes that can be stitched together in a multitude of ways. However, this flexibility conflates the challenge of building higher order Observations that then deriveFrom them (e.g. ObsHaplotype or ObsGenotype derivedfrom ObsVariant). In any case, I'm likely getting off topic.</p>
<p>RE: a profile for guidelines...<br>
I think I've lost the original context of what this is referencing. I thought this reference was something you made originally from my post of  <a href="#narrow/stream/189875-genomics-.2F.20eMerge.20Pilot/topic/Variant.20Data.20Type.20Proposal" title="#narrow/stream/189875-genomics-.2F.20eMerge.20Pilot/topic/Variant.20Data.20Type.20Proposal">Variant Data Type Proposals</a> which was more about providing a definitional representation of variants (independent of Observation) but then useful for referencing in the Observation.valueXXX section so that we don't have to use a mixed bag semi-conditional attributes to craft a variant in a "structured" way. It would also enable us to use these definitional resources or data types to build more complex and standard variant structures and avoid the ObsGenotype derivesFrom ObsHaplotype derivesFrom ObsVariant situation which is not useful in moving in the direction of computationally reliable and clinically accurate genetic test result findings. </p>
<p>The term guidelines to me is more about the methods and SOPs defined by groups like ACMG, CAP, AMP, ASCO, etc.. that provide standards for how the assessment of variation is to be performed in a consistent and useful manner to support clinical practices. I think I'm confused on what you're meaning of guideline is here. I do not see any Resource called guideline and am not picking up the context from your reply. Sorry for my thickheadedness.</p>
<p>BTW - thanks for your patience with me and all my requests etc...</p>
