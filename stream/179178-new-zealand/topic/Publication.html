<p>There'a starting to be opportunities to work with organizations of various types to publish FHIR IGs for them in both NZ and AU</p>
<p>If you're interested in getting involved in these opportunities - either commercially or on some other basis - can you let me know. Most of the opportunities come via me, but I can't do all of them (hardly any of them, actually)</p>
