<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="195045">@John Carter</span> it would be good to align those used in Healthlink products and services with Facility Types published each month as part of the HPI Facility Listing (see dropdown list at <a href="http://itp.patientsfirst.org.nz/Home/Location" target="_blank" title="http://itp.patientsfirst.org.nz/Home/Location">http://itp.patientsfirst.org.nz/Home/Location</a>) - one way or the other.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194931">@Alastair Kenworthy</span> might also be interested in this.</p>

<p>Thanks for that link, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191364">@Peter Jordan</span> . I will investigate the extent to which we already use those concepts. Out of curiosity, where does that list of facility types come from? I've Googled around but not found that particular list of facility types anywhere? (other than in the facility listing itself)</p>

<p>Those Facility Types were created by the Health Identity Team at the Ministry of Health - but I don't think that they are cast in stone. Maybe the Architecture &amp; Standards Group (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194931">@Alastair Kenworthy</span>) might point them towards this discussion and plans to have a ValueSet of SCT concepts that will meet the broader needs of NZ and Australian implementers?</p>
