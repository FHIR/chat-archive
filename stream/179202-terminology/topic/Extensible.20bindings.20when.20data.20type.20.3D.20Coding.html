<p>Per <a href="#narrow/stream/4-implementers/subject/Use.20of.20Meta.2Etag.20vs.20Request.2Eintent" title="#narrow/stream/4-implementers/subject/Use.20of.20Meta.2Etag.20vs.20Request.2Eintent">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/4-implementers/subject/Use.20of.20Meta.2Etag.20vs.20Request.2Eintent</a>, we're looking at making the binding for Resource.meta.tag "extensible" instead of "example" - on the grounds that we really want people to use the specific codes we've defined (shortly to be 2 codes) for the purposes we've defined.  However, the notion of "extensible" gets a bit more complicated when the data type is Coding.  If an element is CodeableConcept and the binding is extensible, then it's not a problem to send a code from the extensible value set plus a more nuanced code from your local space if need be.  However, if the data type is 'Coding', then that means that if your concept is covered by the bound value set, you have no choice but to use only the code from the extensible value set and can't use one of your own.  That's not ideal.  But changing the data type for tags to CodeableConcept isn't ideal either.  Opinions?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191682">@Richard Townley-O'Neill</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  Help me understand how the use of extensions to modify an 'extensible' binding is intended to impact use of the original (non-extended) expansion set. From what you've just said it seems implementers can just use an extension to the resource and bind to a new value set with different values and ignore the original value set. And the new value set can have codes that have a nuanced different meaning then the original expansion members so the implementer never has to send the original codes if they don't want to. Is that correct?</p>

<p>We would define an extension on Coding that allows conveying translations.  So you could send a coding (that would need to be valid against the extensible binding) but could send additional codings as translations that conveyed more nuance.</p>

<p>Extensible says "if a code from the value set applies, you must send that code and not some other".  In CodeableConcept.coding, the codings are translations, so it's fine to send other codes too.  In tag, other codings aren't considered translations, which, unless we provide guidance to the contrary, means that the "extensible" requirement is evaluated on each coding independently.</p>

<p>so we're saying that we want to say to use the authoritative code in one of the codings it if applies. i don't see that we have any reason to say 'and don't use a more specific code' and I don't see why we want to apply this rule to all codings either</p>

<p>in fact, I think the frame of reference is wrong; we have a hammer, so things are going to be a nail. but actually, we don't want to say anything about the binding, we want to say something about the meaning... this is one of a few places in the infrastructure this happens - big wide open use cases, and some very specific rules about particular codes for particular meanings</p>

<p>The problem seems rather nail-like...  It's a Coding.  It has a binding.  We want to say "if you're trying to say something like this, you must use our codes, but you're free to say whatever other sorts of coded things you like that aren't covered by our codes using whatever code systems you like".  That's exactly what Extensible does, so I don't see how this is different - and I think using a different mechanism is going to cause confusion and non-conformance.</p>

<p>If I want to send codes for both 'authorised' and 'authorised because boss says so' in a CodeableConcept element I could send it as two codings in the one element, or as two instances of the element. Is the difference important? Do implementers pay attention to the difference?</p>
<p>In a Coding element I would send two instances of the element. Or one element with an extension on Coding.</p>
<p>From what Lloyd says, if the Coding element has an extensible binding it is prohibited to send the two codes ('authorised' and 'authorised by boss says so') as two instances of the element.</p>
<p>Why is this a good approach to extensibe on coding? Is this because there is no structural relationship between the codes?</p>

<p>The binding is to a ValueSet definition rather than a ValueSet expansion, right?  Then make sure the ValueSet definition says <code>include.filter.code is-a 'authorised'</code> and not <code>include.filter.code = 'authorised'</code> or <code>include.concept = 'authorised'</code> (forgive my pseudo-code)</p>
