<p>Required binding mean a source system  can support 80% of them and still be conforman,   I kind of derived it from looking at the min binding extension.  <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-minValueSet" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-minValueSet">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-minValueSet</a>  but <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  this particular nugget is not explicitly stated in the spec ( I can't find it)? should it be?</p>

<p>A system can be conformant if it only supports one code.  There's an extension to indicate the minimum that must be supported</p>

<p>This is a surprise to me if I'm understanding <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> . Are you saying that vocabulary has agreed that to be conformant to a required binding, all a system has to do is understand one of the defined members of the required expansion? I do not remember hearing or voting on that and would like to see the specification in FHIR that purports to clarify that.</p>

<p>As one currently tasked to review all the SCT concepts in a CDA Implementation Guide, that makes sense to me!  Given that, in practice, there is no guarantee that any given concept will be active in the edition and version of the underlying Code System in use, it would be impractical for an international standard to mandate support for particular concepts in many Value Sets, even where there is a required binding to a VS.</p>

<p>So what I am hearing is two things:</p>
<p>1. It may not be obvious to the average reader of the spec that required does not mean that they have to support all the codes.<br>
2. That IGs may define what codes must be supported</p>

<p>if not specified in an IG then the only two ways I can think of  for the implementation to expose this information is if they create their own profiles or return OperationOutcomes for unsupported codes on queries etc...</p>

<p>Required binding is about what codes are permitted.  The set of codes that<br>
are supported MUST be allowed to be a subset and the base binding is (and<br>
must be) silent as to the size and nature of the subset.  A profile can use<br>
a standard extension to indicate a "must support" value set if desired.<br>
The core spec never asserts mustSupport about anything.  Even mandatory<br>
elements can be hard- coded as fixed values by senders or ignored by<br>
receivers.</p>
<p>It's important that we separate declarations of "what's allowed in the<br>
instance" from "what must implementers actually support/do something useful<br>
with".  The latter can only ever be asserted by profiles.</p>

<p>Ok - well this to me sounds like something we need to make <strong>very clear</strong> to implementers and profile creators as it seems to me to be a <strong>BIG</strong> hole in how folks will assume the process works. What is the default behavior expected to be? I'm going to guess <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> will say an implementer does not have to <em>support</em> any required codes at all. So <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> , tell me what it means in plain english to implement a required binding with none of this specified? What would I be <strong>required</strong> to do? How do I explain you need to "not <em>mis-understand</em>" all the codes and you don't need to <em>support</em> any of them?  What does this mean practically?</p>

<p>As soon as we start trying to write anything extra about what it means to implement, we run into the problem that there's a limitless number of ways to use FHIR, because who knows what you are trying to do. That's why must-support is never set to true in the base specification; instead, we delegate that to implementation guides, where they may have enough context to make rules about what your system must do</p>

<p>If an element with a required binding is present, it must have a code from the value set.  However, it's possible the sender will not "support" some or even most of the codes in the valueset.  For example, a system could hardcode Patient.gender as "unknown" if it was trying to comply with US Core.  Similarly, a receiver might ignore any codes other than "male" or "female".  If you want your profile to dictate more, you have the extension to do that.</p>

<p>it seems to me that we could be clear in the section about must-support that in the absence of any implementation guidance otherwise, systems are not required to 'support' the entire value domain of any element (or not support the element at all) as long as instances are conformant, and to reference this from the section about required bindings</p>

<p>In addition to what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> has said, I think we need to make clear that even if the element is a "must support" it requires an extension to also define any codes in a value set, even a required one, which codes an implementer must accept and be able to send. The fact that this is an extension in the base is a big mistake IMO - 100% of systems must decide what codes they can send and receive to use - ever heard of semantic interoperability? I'll bet a <em>purchased beer</em> that less than 50% pf FHIR implementers understand the implications of this thread.  Asking folks about this at the connectahon would be worthwhile.</p>

<p>well, you can certainly propose that we change something. It might be time to consider elevating min-valueSet and max-valueSet to base properties of ElementDefinition.binding rather than being extensions. But I don't think that'll help much with the understanding problem. </p>
<p>but while we're talking about we can talk about additional additional other bindings, since we have ongoing discussion about the limitations of a single main binding (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191375">@Alexander Henket</span> )</p>

<p>I think a  better place to state the clarification would be here: <a href="http://build.fhir.org/terminologies.html#strength" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/terminologies.html#strength">http://build.fhir.org/terminologies.html#strength</a>  by adding to each binding  where it is stated "the concept in this element SHALL be from the specified value set"   Lloyd's dulcet phrasing : "However, it's possible a system will not "support" some or even most of the codes in the valueset."</p>

<p>OTOH I worry trying to parse out the meaning here it may lead to more confusion than clarity.</p>

<p>I've read this thread cover to cover. As of yet I don't see a use case for min/max value set. Also I was unfamiliar with them before today.</p>
<p>When the element binding is required, senders SHALL draw from that binding, and receivers SHALL support anything the binding allows. That has always been the most clear statement we were able to get. Now where things go sour is when you try to define <em>support</em>. As Lloyd already mentioned: when you only care about pregnant women, then your receiver <em>support</em> for men/unknown is probably that you discard the info. So I guess the profile were to say: required AdministrativeGender, minValueSet "female" for that system.</p>
<p>maxValueSet is a whole different ball game. I'm still trying to grasp that one. Seems like I could say: extensible SNOMED CT ObservableEntities, maxValueSet SNOMED CT ObservableEntities  + LOINC</p>
<p>But if both SNOMED CT and LOINC are allowable for an element: why not create a combined ValueSet, or (our usual), slice the thing where one slice points to SNOMED CT and the other points to LOINC?</p>

<p>minValueSet allows you to identify what codes must be supported.  The reason for maxValueSet is so that you can have a 'useful' value set as your extensible binding that's reasonable for use in a drop-down, while still placing an outer bound on what codes are allowed.  We do this for things like language and units of measure where the set of possible codes from the underlying code systems (which we want to enforce) is infinite/near-infinite, but the set of commonly used codes is relatively small.  The extensible binding lets systems use a dropdown for the easy stuff and the max binding ensures that we still end up with a legal UCUM or IETF language code if the user decides to enter an 'other'.</p>
