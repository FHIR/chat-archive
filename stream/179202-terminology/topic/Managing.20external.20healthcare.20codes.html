<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a question regarding industry-standard healthcare codes (e.g., LOINC and SNOMED CT). We are planning to implement a validation engine and need to get a better understanding of the admin / legal issues that we'll need to address. If we need to access a terminology server that's hosted by one of the committees (for example LOINC), what steps do we need to take to be able to access their terminology server and use their codes? Do we need to get a license from these organizations in order to use their services? What type(s) of security mechanisms do they use (e.g., OAuth2). </p>

<p>typically, those organizations provide content, not services. you would use one of the open source or commercial implementations of a terminology server locally, and follow the instructions for the server of your choice to load the content provided by the loinc/snomed etc.  And you'd make your own choices as supported by your software of choice regarding security</p>
<p>As for license agreements, each of the authorities has their own agreement for you to make.</p>

<p>Thank you, Graham. That is helpful.</p>
