<p>Hi, <br>
I am attemting to upload both the spanish and the international releases of Snomed CT. However, when I upload the second one the first one is deleted. The second one is created with the same ID, and it is even created as version #1. I believe this might be happening because the code system's URL is the same for both releases, but I am not sure. Is there a way to upload multiple releases from snomed (or from any particular code system, for that matter)?Multiple CodeSystems for Snomed</p>

<p>Multiple SNOMED CT editions/release versions (both would be considered to be "versions" in FHIR) can be hosted together, but the server needs to be architected specifically to support that (for example, base HAPI and it's uploader wouldn't handle that).</p>

<p>I just ran the HAPI JPA example server on my PC, so it has the default configuration.</p>
