<p>In the DAF Medication Resource, for the Medication.package.container path (definition: kind of container a medication is packaged in), the example terminology binding references a set of SNOMED CT qualifier codes such as “bag – unit of product usage (qualifier value).” Given the definition of the path for this binding, it seems the SNOMED CT Physical object hierarchy may be more appropriate than the Qualifier value hierarchy. Interestingly, the mapping exercise reveals there are similar concepts in both branches, e.g., 404218003 Ampule – unit of product usage (qualifier value) and 469844003 Ampule (physical object). With a focus on interoperability, we are interested in learning what strategy others have applied or what strategy should be applied here when the value set conformance is example and, arguably, multiple hierarchies could be used.<br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192122">@Mary Dobbins</span> I agree, it should be the physical object hierarchy. Not sure how that is fixed.</p>

<p>it's in the definition of the medication resource itself. You would create a gForge task proposing the pharmacy fix the example binding</p>

<p>Talking strictly from the SNOMED CT point of view, ongoing work on defining a proposed drug model for new/future national drug extensions will likely have to revise and clean up units of usage on the qualifier hierarchy to align with established drug terminologies. Rob's comment makes a lot of sense, but it would imply a much broader revision of the SNOMED content model [and therefore more time/iterations] (e.g. not all units of usage are physical objects, most medicinal products are physical objects, some devices contain substances as active ingredients, some units of usage are actually devices, etc.)  I am an absolute FHIR beginner, so my personal opinion is entirely SNOMED-centric and might not be relevant to Mary's original question.</p>

<p>I think it's confusing to have duplicated concepts in the heirarchies that differ by mode of use, not underlying meaning, and then to have inconsistencies between them</p>

<p>Agree it is confusing. But ampule (physical object) was created in 20140731 together with thousands of device categories originated in GMDN with different use cases in mind. The drug/medication use cases would likely need to consider the unit of product usage under qualifier hierarchy. It would be helpful to raise a request to IHTSDO reporting the issue, so it gets considered.</p>

<p>Issues/requests for change/guidance can be posted through <a href="https://request.ihtsdotools.org/#/dashboard" target="_blank" title="https://request.ihtsdotools.org/#/dashboard">https://request.ihtsdotools.org/#/dashboard</a> if you/FHIR/HL7 have an IHTSDO-provided account, or contacting IHTSDO staff working on those subjects and/or interested or participating on this thread. Also through NRCs (if you are based on a member country). Many participants here have access to request submissions, but I was assuming there were already established processes and defined channels at the institutional or project level  to deal with this kind of issues. If there aren't it would be worth exploring such an option.</p>

<p>the FHIR project itself doesn't have any formal channel for this. We have an active collaboration though. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192077">@Linda Bird</span> what is the right way to do this?</p>

<p>The correct process is through the HTA. HTA is the fomally defined conduit for all IHTSDO interactions from HL7. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  we don't have a formal process to request modeling approaches to SCT but I think you should attend a meeting to clarify what you want HTA to do and we'll find a solution.</p>

<p>well, it's not really about me. We kind of need some kind of streamlined process around user discovered issues with SCT. And streamlined processes isn't really what people associate with the HTA at this moment</p>

<p>That is the process non-the-less. You don't get to directly submit changes to IHTSDO per the agreement between HL7 and IHTSDO</p>

<p>Help me understand exactly what you want to see change in SCT and what that will fix for FHIR. The point here is that HTA is the conduit for HL7 requests to IHTSDO. It's fine if the request is not something that only fixes HL7 stuff (as I suspect this might) but we still need to explictly state the requested change and justify why HL7 is asking.</p>

<p>well, it's a general issues that 2 heirarchies have overlapping content, and they don't seem properly differentiated. see <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192967">@Guillermo Reynoso</span> comments above. But this is a general issue, not a specific issue that we've identified</p>

<p>So by general you mean it is not directly affecting FHIR functionality (at a minimum there is a work around). So this is a general concern, correct?</p>
