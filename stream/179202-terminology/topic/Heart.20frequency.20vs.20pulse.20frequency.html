<p>To record/calculate a pulse deficit (Condition) we need to separate heart rate as <em>heart frequency</em> and <em>pulse frequency</em>. Vital Signs IG does not differ on these concepts (LOINC = 8867-4) in Observation.code. </p>
<p>We could differ the two concepts with Observation.method (e.g. Palpatation for pulse and ECG for heart frequency), but it adds unwanted complexity and there are different methods. </p>
<p>Both LOINC and SNOMED CT lacks codes - there is also no code for pulse deficit as a calculated value (Observation). </p>
<p>Have anyone the same use case, and probably solved it?</p>
