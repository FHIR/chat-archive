<p>Can anyone share any experience with creating new ICD codes?  Anyone have experience?</p>

<p>As far as I know only NCHS creates new ICD-10-CM codes - and WHO creates the "base" ICD-10 codes.</p>

<p>Do they release new codes for ICD-10, or is everything now focused on ICD-11?</p>

<p>it looks like ICD-10 2016 is the latest - not certain if more are planned (or not)<br>
ICD-10-CM (US) continues to be released yearly - the 2019 version is for use from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019</p>

<p>I think the case the people I'm talking to is for adding a term for Castleman's Disease - it has its own code in ICD-10, but has been lumped  in with with a bunch of other lymphoproliferative disorders in ICD-11 (and given that ICD-10 is not used outside the US, it's a problem).  I assumed these people had done their due diligence, but there's a link on <a href="https://icd.who.int/dev11/l-m/en" target="_blank" title="https://icd.who.int/dev11/l-m/en">https://icd.who.int/dev11/l-m/en</a> which refers to making proposals and comments.... Sigh.  Thanks for your suggestions</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192121">@Geoff Low</span> I didn't realize that you were referring to ICD-11.  A preview of that has been released, but it hasn't yet been officially approved by WHO and isn't scheduled to take effect until 1 January 2022, as I understand.  So I don't believe that any countries are actually using it yet, and if you want new codes to use now they would need to be in ICD-10 or one of its country/regional variations.  The ICD 10 codes are used all over the world, except for a very few countries that still use ICD-9 (and I believe the US was the most recent one to move from ICD-9 to ICD-10).  If your main or only concern is getting this "right" in ICD-11, then I think I would try to speak about that with Chris Chute.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197078">@Christopher Chute</span> is on Zulip, but isn't subscribed to this stream, so you probably will need to message him privately.</p>

<p>Thanks, that's really helpful.  I'll follow up - Hope you have a great break</p>
