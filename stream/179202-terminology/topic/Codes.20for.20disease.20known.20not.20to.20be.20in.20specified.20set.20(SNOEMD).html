<p>Suppose I am coding sub-types of a given disease X with SNOMED (e.g. diabetes, which has the sub-types type-1, type-2 etc.).  Let's say there are  5 possible subtypes of X, viz. A, B, C, D, and E. However, for a particular purpose, I only want to explicitly capture the occurrence of A and B - for the rests, I only want to capture "patient has a different type of disease" (neither A nor B, so C, D, or E). The parent code X is of course also implied, but using that is too vague because it also includes A &amp; B. I want to be able to code all cases uniformly as conditions, so I want the code for "this type of disease but not subtype A or B" to mean exactly that and not be a generic "other" code. In effect, I want a "union code" saying "either C or D or E". Is there some way of doing that (short of defining a custom code with that exact meaning)? E.g is there some of way of using a condition with the code set to X and then elsewhere using other codes to indicate (in a structured form) that the subtype is known not to be A or B?</p>

<p>Why not just allow people to say C D or E, then just treat them as a group for your use case?</p>
<p>Stopping someone from providing the extra detail (when known) is somewhat of an anti pattern.</p>

<p>Agreed, but this is something that has already been fixed (pre-existing guidelines).</p>

<p>There is no way to do this with snomed as-is. The best you can do is define a new code - F - that is a child of X and the parent of C, D, and E.</p>

<p>Can one design such a code (within SNOMED) "on-the-fly" or do you mean one should submit that as a suggestion for a new code to SNOMED?</p>

<p>It would have to be a new code for SNOMED. There's no good way to specify disjunction (or negation) via post coordination.</p>
<p>Given that this is a guidelines driven requirement, it's probably reasonable for the new code to be created.</p>
<p>If you absolutely must do this via post coordination then you could construct a Situation With Explicit Context code that says "X known present" and "A known absent" and "B known absent", but that's pretty horrid for data analysts to consume.</p>

<p>Thinking more about this: Is there a standard way, in SNOMED or ICD-10, of creating <em>conjunctive</em> codes? I.e. if I want to say "the patient is known to have either disease A or B" - again in cases where there is no parent term representing this particular set of codes.</p>
