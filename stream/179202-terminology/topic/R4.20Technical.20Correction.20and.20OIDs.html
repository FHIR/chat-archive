<p>I just opened the R4 technical correction for review. The R4 technical correction contains a correction for a rather unfortunate oversight (one that I bear personal responsibility for)</p>
<p>The line item for the change says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Change all code system OIDs to use the root 2.16.840.1.113883.4.642.4. instead of 2.16.840.1.113883.4.642.1. due to reassigning OID leaf values without updating the root in the past</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some more history: </p>
<ul>
<li>We publish OIDs for all our code systems and value sets to enable them to work with OID based infrastructures</li>
<li>Initially, we assigned OIDS to bindings, and by extension, to code systems and value sets</li>
<li>by R3 we had built out a proper vocab sub-system, and we had some issues with the OIDs that were being assigned since they were being assigned at the wrong level. </li>
<li>vocab decided to reinitialise all the OIDs, and use a new root value so that we didn't re-use the OIDs</li>
<li>I made this change in March 2017</li>
<li>at this time, we changed all the value sets to use the root 2.16.840.1.113883.4.642.3. instead of 2.16.840.1.113883.4.642.2.</li>
<li>but for some reason I can't imagine, I failed to change the code system root. And no one else noticed at the time...</li>
<li>which means that we published R4 with re-used OIDs for different code systems - see <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/OIDs" title="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/OIDs">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/OIDs</a> for details</li>
<li>FMG decided to fix this as a technical correction in R4 (since we are doing one anyway) - to change the root from .1 to .4 so that there's no re-use. </li>
</ul>
<p>I am drawing vocab's attention to this change specifically. It's a very simple technical oversight with rather dramatic implications. (I am sorry)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  I know you fixed this in R4, but it doesn't seem to be fixed in R5.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/2020Feb/codesystem-administrative-gender.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/2020Feb/codesystem-administrative-gender.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/2020Feb/codesystem-administrative-gender.html</a> has 2.16.840.1.113883.4.642.1.2</li>
<li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-administrative-gender.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-administrative-gender.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-administrative-gender.html</a> has 2.16.840.1.113883.4.642.4.2</li>
<li><a href="http://build.fhir.org/codesystem-administrative-gender.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/codesystem-administrative-gender.html">http://build.fhir.org/codesystem-administrative-gender.html</a> has 2.16.840.1.113883.4.642.1.2<br>
I assume (please confirm) that the correct go-forward OID is the R4 OID (not the R5 / build OID)</li>
</ul>
