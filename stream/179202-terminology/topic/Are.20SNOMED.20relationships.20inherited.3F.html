<p>If I have a SNOMED concept that has children via |is-a| relationships, do those children inherit any attribute relationships?  I'm assuming yes but it is it explicit? If I create a value set of disorders related to the heart finding site, do I get 'abscess of heart' as well as its children 'abscess of mediastinum', and 'structural disorder of heart'?  Or all of the children explicitly given the attribute relationships of the parent?</p>

<p>Semantically, yes, any relationship true of the parent is also true for all children.<br>
Where it's a little tricky is when the attribute name or value has children.  In that case the snomed relationships file does not include redundancies.<br>
For example fracture of lower limb has the relationship finding site = Lower limb, which is also true for fracture of foot, but you'll only see the relationship finding site = foot because foot is a descendant of lower limb.</p>

<p>It's a complex question involving with isa and/or part-of relationships.</p>

<p>Not all the parts of a lower limb would inherit that. For example, the its skin.</p>
