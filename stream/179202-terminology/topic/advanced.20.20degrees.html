<p>Hello! I am working with a BH EHR mapping their data elements to FHIR.  I am looking for a code set with advanced degrees such as a Master of Counseling (M.C.) or a Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) - I know FHIR has the DegreeLicenseCertificate Codeset. However, I was wondering if maybe there was a more expansive one for capturing advanced degrees perhaps? If not, is there a place I submit a request for more degrees to be added to the original code set.   Please advise! Thank you!</p>
