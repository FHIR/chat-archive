<p>I am trying to test out a use case, where I want to see all conditions of a certain type (In this case cognitive function finding). </p>
<p>From the documentation I can see that something like  GET [base]/Condition?code:below=373930000 should work. I have also tried using the below-modifier, and specifying the system - GET [base]/Condition?code:below=http://snomed.info/sct|373930000 </p>
<p>However, I have tried several of the public available test-servers, and none of them seems to support the searches, or return empty bundles. (I have checked that Condition-instances that fulfill the search criteria actually exist on the servers).</p>
<p>Do you know of any test-servers where I can test code-supsumption? Alternative strategies for testing my use case would also be welcome.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Kirstine</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194347">@Kirstine Rosenbeck Gøeg</span> I show this capability with the <code>:below</code> modifier (typically using the HAPI server) when I do FHIR terminology teaching.  I can send you a query that should show that it works (my HAPI server is being a bit slow right now, though, so I'm verifying that it actually is working first!).</p>

<p>This query shows "Code in a resource subsumes the specified search code (e.g. is-a* relationship) - below “Diabetes mellitus” (73211009)":</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>http://fhir.hausamconsulting.com/r4/Condition?code:below=http://snomed.info/sct%7C73211009
</code></pre></div>
<p>The data currently on the server seems a little odd (and it isn't all being returned?), but I think you can see that it works.</p>

<p>The server does seem to be responding rather slowly (I'll try to look into that) - so you may need to be patient. :)</p>
