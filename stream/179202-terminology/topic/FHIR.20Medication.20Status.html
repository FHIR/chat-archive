<p>It seems to me that the definitions for Medication Statuses of "entered-in-error" and "cancelled" are backwards.  FHIR lists: </p>
<p>entered-in-error: "Some of the actions that are implied by the medication request may have occurred. For example, the medication may have been dispensed and the patient may have taken some of the medication. Clinical decision support systems should take this status into account"</p>
<p>cancelled: "The prescription has been withdrawn before any administrations have occurred"</p>
<p>Does anyone else agree?  I believe most users would interpret entered-in-error to mean that the medication was stopped before it was ever started because it was "entered-in-error" (i.e. entered into the wrong patient's chart). </p>

<p>I don't think they're backwards, but the definition for entered-in-error should contain a sentence in front that better explains that status.  The language there is usage notes about the status.</p>
