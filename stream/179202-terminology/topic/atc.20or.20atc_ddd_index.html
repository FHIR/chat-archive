<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191415">@Giorgio Cangioli</span> The HTA page contains the information as authorised by the WHO ATC folk, as you will see on it.  So this is the URI that should be used</p>

<p>The problem is if that decision is made when there's been an official URL in long use, it breaks systems.  The HTA <strong>MUST</strong> check to see if there's already a URI in use by the FHIR community and listed in the FHIR spec before assigning URLs to things.  The URL for ATC has been established by FHIR since DSTU1.  It's way too late to change.  WHO's preferences simply can't matter here.</p>

<p>I think that we (as the entire FHIR community and particularly the Vocabulary community within FHIR) haven't settled on that last point that <code>Code system authors don't get to dictate what URL gets used for their code systems ...</code>.  But we need to come to an understanding and agreement on it.</p>

<p>If code system authors create IP rules that try to dictate what URL must be used, then we should avoid using those code systems because they obviously don't care about impact on implementation or the harm that can be done.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> Thank you for your comments.  May I politely request that those who have <strong>chosen </strong> to use identifiers that are not authorised by code system owners check with code system owners before they publish and use them,  rather than "dictate" after the fact? Your views on the policy (not dictatorship) are well known, Lloyd; thank you for sharing them again.  They are noted.  Giorgio asked a question.  I have answered.  You are at liberty not to like my answer and you are at liberty to ignore my answer with whatever consequences may or may not follow from that.  It does not change my answer.</p>

<p>Because we would <em>like</em> the URLs for code systems to resolve usefully, it makes sense to reach out to code system owners for a URL that we can count on resolving <em>when we don't already have one in use</em>.

<p>Some code system authors do not have a clue what makes a good canonical URL for FHIR purposes. For example, NCI wants <code>http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/xml/owl/EVS/Thesaurus.owl</code> which is a horrible canonical (it brings in the physical formatting of their master data). I do not think code system owners should have carte blanche make this decision for the FHIR community.</p>

<p>Agreed that implementation is important.  Almost all the systems I've ever been involved in building (with two exceptions) are still working.  But it is not my god.  I'm really sorry guys, but I cannot sacrifice the principles I know to be true.  So, if that doesn't fit your world, that's sad.  I'm trying to get things better for you on terminology, but it's really hard when efforts are so rejected.  I personally worked with the ATC folk to get everything aligned.

<p>While HTA can set policy moving forward for URIs of newly-added code systems, I agree with Lloyd that we cannot make breaking changes to existing implementations without assessing the impact  - especially in this case when it would involve breaking systems that had been using an existing URI for many years before the policy was created.  Whether we like it or not, we're obligated to support what we previously defined unless the community agrees to the breaking change, so HTA should adjust their process to include verifying that no significant breaking changes will occur before making agreements with external terminology providers about URIs.  In this case, the prior URI as listed in the FHIR spec should be used.</p>

<p>What would be useful - and what is needed - is a policy that looks like this:<br>
When assigning URIs for a code system, the following priorities shall be adhered to, in order of priority:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code system URIs <em>SHALL</em> be static.  Change to a URL in use by the community may only be contemplated in the following cases:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>the same URI has been accidentally issued to multiple code systems or what was thought to be a single code system has turned out, through its behavior, to be more than one.  (Here, the change is to ensure semantic interoperability where system + code has consistent meaning)</li>
<li>there is a typo in the URL that is going to cause significant confusion to the community AND the community has determined that the pain of dealing with the confusion is greater than the pain of making the change (which generally means that the code system is not yet in wide use)<br>
NOTE: this requirement does not apply across standards families.  For example, if v3 used an OID, FHIR can use a meaningful URI because transformation is already a requirement at the boundary between v3 and FHIR.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Code system URIs SHOULD be human-readable and human meaningful.  This is a key aspect of reducing implementer burden and learning curve.  As much as possible, we avoid URIs made of of OIDs or UUIDs or other character sequences that don't reflect to a human what the code system actually is.  Note that this does not trump #1.  If (unfortunately) an OID is already in widespread use in FHIR implementations, that defacto becomes the mandated URI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code system URIs SHOULD be concise.  A URI is something that will need to be typed many thousands of times and will also appear in millions or billions of instances.  Over-long URIs impose a cost on implementers, storage and bandwidth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code system URIs SHOULD be URLs that resolve to some useful description of the code system and SHOULD be defined such that they can be expect to reliably resolve for a long time (many decades).  I.e. they should be established as permalinks.  This isn't essential, but is certainly a nice-to-have</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In cases where a URI is not already in use by the community, the HTA should work with amenable terminology providers to determine an appropriate URI, primarily because the terminology provider is generally the best organization to achieve #4.  However, in meeting the objective for #4, all prior priorities must be respected.  If #4 cannot be achieved in a manner that also adheres to the higher priorities, the HTA should assign a URI that adheres to the first 3 priorities and, if possible, relies on HL7 to establish the permalink that will achieve #4.</p>
<p>In cases where a URI is already in use by the community, the HTA should confirm that the entity pointed to by the URI is in fact a single distinct code system, and having confirmed that, publish the URI already in use.</p>
<p>If the IP usage rules of an organization preclude the use of a URI that adheres to #1, we should treat that code system in the same manner we treat code systems that do not enforce code-concept permanence.  I.e. A code system that is not safe for use and that should be avoided.</p>

<p>#3 isn't pushing for 10 character URIs, but it is saying "try to avoid 150 character ones".  If you can get a 150 character URI that will resolve, you should still look at it as suspect.  (In part because 150 characters suggests that the URI is pretty deep, which makes the likelihood of it sticking around as a permalink pretty low.)</p>

<p>Re: #3, an IG that I work on (the SMART Health Card Vaccination IG) is negatively affected by long code system URIs -- our resources have payload size constraints in order to fit inside a QR code. For this use case (which is admittedly probably pretty rare), there is a tangible difference between 20 and 50 chars -- it could in some cases be the difference between a patient having to carry two QR codes instead of one to represent their COVID vaccine series.</p>

<p>Thanks for your thoughts Lloyd. Thank you Julie for so eloquently describing the service HTA provides. To Lloyd's points, <br>
#1 ignores reality, urls will change. Implementers should design for change - just as a patient identifier such as medical record number has a probability of changing, so does a code system url. <br>
#2 good thing to aim for, however might not always be possible especially when considered with #3. <br>
#3 ignores the fact that copy/paste has been around for decades (cost to implementers argument) and storage is a shaky argument at best. - storage costs also hasn't been an issue for years (noting the exception of QR codes). </p>
<p>The comment about database column names is specious - database schemas are not used when designing for interoperability. </p>
<p>HTA works with terminology providers to ensure that HL7 is representing the provider's  owned and managed content as required. HL7 is not in the driver's seat, but is working with the terminology owner to guide and inform them.  The priority is for the terminology owner and their IP to be respected, not for HL7 implementers to feel free to use whatever they want. HL7  is not a dictatorship as suggested by the dramatic last sentence about safety for use.</p>

<p>I agree and distinctly recall a Vocab discussion on this very topic several years ago (in Montreal?) and the issue of incumbent URIs was foremost.  This is cannot be claimed as a new issue to HTA.</p>
<p>The frustration I have here is that the HTA page has no apparent acknowledgement of a pre-existing URI, nor that this was raised with the owner and that the impact / cost of selecting something different (which is <em>very</em> large) was understood and only done with some reasonable/specified justification.</p>

<p>Hi All - The HTA process did require requestors to check for existing URLs before requesting a new one. It specifically suggested checking the FHIR Code System page.</p>
<p>"Requestor does due diligence - searching of existing code system information (e.g., Uniform Terminology Governance Repository, FHIR Codesystem Registry, OID Registry, FHIR Community Codesystem Registry, HTA External Terminologies Registry) PRIOR to contacting HTA for assistance"</p>
<p>With the release of THO, the policy has been updated to require requestors to check THO and the HTA confluence pages. Work is in progress to migrate and align the information on HTA confluence with the information at THO by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191333">@Reuben Daniels</span>  and others.

<p>All that being said, I've added this topic to the upcoming HTA meeting so we can come to a resolution on ATC in particular.  I'm hopeful we'll come to a combined understanding of a way forward that supports implementers, respects the existing HL7 policies and processes with regards to the use of external  terminologies, and utilizes (where necessary) the tools in place to support instances where change to code system information needs to be communicated and documented.</p>

<p>IMO it should not matter what the URI looks like (whether it ends with .owl or whatever) as long as it is identifying the "thing" - ie the code system rather than a specific representation of the thing.<br>
For these cases, since the OWL itself includes a declaration of the ontology's URI (which just happens to end with .owl), I have taken that to be the identification of the thing.  Used as a URI, nobody should ever really be looking at the sub-parts of the string to infer anything.</p>

<p>Ideally the canonical URL would resolve to a a variety of syntaxes depending on the Accept header, so a specific file extension would be misleading at best.  I don't know that we'd refuse a URL with an extension, but it certainly would be best practice to avoid it if defining a new one.  It's not something we'd consider changing a URL for though.</p>

<p>The system that <em>shall</em> be used for ATC codes is <a href="http://www.whocc.no/atc">http://www.whocc.no/atc</a>.  I can't speak for whether ATC_ddd constitutes a new code system, or two code systems.</p>

<p>We've been able to get the complete source for ATC.  But right now the ATC version on <a href="http://tx.fhir.org">tx.fhir.org</a> is May 2020, and we still don't have a regular and reliable way of getting the full updates.</p>

<p>Not commenting on acquisition...</p>
<p>URL from FHIR for ATC stands...as we've agreed is the case for all previously defined URLs in R4 UNLESS community has agreed a technical error was made and agrees to a change. The codesystem URL for ATC is <a href="https://www.whocc.no/atc">https://www.whocc.no/atc</a> and is shown as such at THO and in FHIR. Both the HTA and FHIR external code system metadata are being reconciled and systematically (by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191333">@Reuben Daniels</span> as part of the next planned THO release) migrated to THO as the single source of truth (as agreed upon by HTA, FHIR-I, Vocab, TSMG and TSC). In that process any remaining inconsistencies in the older HTA pages will be resolved. </p>
<p>The question about ATC and DDD being one or two code systems is new and separate question (as far as I understand it) and will be on the agenda for the TSMG call next week (instead of waiting until the next HTA call in two weeks).</p>

<p>HTA has confirmed via ATC SMEs that there is only one code system with respect to ATC. The ATC code system is composed of ATC codes that may have a defined daily dose (DDD) attribute.</p>

<p>I don't think that is likely to end up being the case, as the DDDs are <strong>quantity</strong> attributes associated with particular ATC code/route combinations.  An example is here for the ATC code for semaglutide (<a href="https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=A10BJ06">A10BJ06</a>).</p>

<p>Looking at the example that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span> shared:</p>
<p>Seems the "The DDD is a <em>unit</em> of measurement" wording on <code>https://www.whocc.no/ddd/definition_and_general_considera/</code> set me on the wrong foot ... Rather "The DDD is the assumed average maintenance <em>dose</em> per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults."</p>
<p>Seems the DDD is a quantity rather than only a unit.</p>

<p>We have an experimental CodeSystem of the German ATC adaption which is very similar to the WHO ATC. Agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span> that the DDDs should be properties. We have them as string type properties currently, although quantity would be more suitable for DDDs. Quantity is none of the supported concept property types though.</p>
