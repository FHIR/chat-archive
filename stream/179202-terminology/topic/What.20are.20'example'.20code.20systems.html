<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> and I have a disagreement.  He believes that if a CodeSystem instance has a content type of 'example' it means that the codes it declares aren't necessarily even real codes of the code system.  I don't understand why that would ever make sense.  I believe that the codes in a CodeSystem instance (whether complete, fragment, supplement or example are <em>always</em> valid codes.  What makes a CodeSystem instance is that it's just a small semi-random subset of valid codes (unlike fragment which is a complete set of codes of a specific subsection of a code system, supplement which only lists the codes its supplementing, and complete which lists everything.</p>
<p>Does anyone else thing that the codes where the content is only 'example' don't have to actually be valid codes from the code system in question?</p>

<p>The definition in the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-codesystem-content-mode.html#codesystem-content-mode-example">R4 specification</a> states that...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few representative concepts are included in the code system resource. There is no useful intent in the subset choice and there's no process to make it workable: it's not intended to be workable</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That suggests to me that it's the subset of concepts that aren't workable, not that the individual example concepts can be bogus. If the intent is to permit the inclusion of invalid concepts, maybe it should say a 'few random example or bogus concepts', rather than 'representative' which conveys some degree of meaning.</p>

<p>the core of this issue is that when the validator encounters a code from an example code system (not an example binding), it puts a warning - not an error - against the code saying that because the code system is incomplete, the validator can't be sure that this is a valid code. This is something that we agreed during the UTG development work. I think it's the right thing to do too, but Lloyd strongly disagrees - if it's in the example codes, then it's known to be valid. I don't see that the language says that.</p>
<p>This was caused by the fact that an Hl7 defined code system has content = example in THO. I'm not at all clear what that means if it doesn't mean 'these are the kind of concepts you might see in a code system like this'.</p>

<p>We're talking about a <em>real</em> code system here.  E.g. SNOMED, LOINC, UCUM, whatever.  However, we're <em>not</em> exposing the entire code system, just some examples.  Why would we allow them to be invalid codes?</p>

<p>There shouldn't <em>ever</em> be an 'example' instance of a code system that doesn't correspond to a real full-fledged code system.  The whole point is to expose a limited subset of the 'real' codes when it's not practical to show all of them.  Perhaps because of licensing issues, perhaps because of volume issues.</p>

<p>The very first CodeSystem resource that I created was a pure example, with no intention for it to be used for any other purpose. It contained 4 valid concepts - but all identified with fabricated codes and I set the CodeSystem.experimental property to true. However, I didn't set the content type to example as it was conceptually complete (i.e. contained all 4 NZ regions), but perhaps I should have done so?</p>

<p>We can create example codes systems with 'complete' content.  We do it regularly.  And we can strictly validate against those example code systems.  We also need CodeSystem instances for validation purposes that don't contain a complete set of codes - or even a complete 'area' of a code system, but which are sufficient to validate a set of examples or to give implementers an idea of the kinds of codes that exist without exposing details of the code system.  That is what we defined the 'example' contentType for.  </p>
<p>I haven't yet heard a use-case for having a code system that contains codes that can't safely be validated against that code system.  <em>Why</em> would we want to do that?</p>

<p>I think if you profile and wish to have a binding that indicates meaningful codes, then I thought 'preferred' would be used. That would say that the codes are real, and valid, and that you could have other codes used alternatively to the ones provided. It is a tighter binding but allows example to keep example's loose definition (unreliably representing true/valid codes).  Seems to be a choice based on the what the profiler is wishing to say.</p>

<p>To be clear here, we are discussing what does it mean when a code system resource has CodeSyste.content=example. Nothing more. </p>
<p>Understanding that this may be considered by some as revisionist, but I think .content=example has no useful meaning. </p>
<ol>
<li>If you are making a "test" or example code system with made up content that you are not doing real work with, then set codesystem.experimental = T.  I assume in these cases you would want to see content=complete. I see no additional value in using something different in this case but am open to justifications on how this should not be true. Given we are talking about publisher changes no matter what, saying "that is not how the publisher works" is not sufficient. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191364">@Peter Jordan</span>'s code system should be one of these.</li>
<li>I do agree with Lloyd that within the FHIR ecosystem, if you publish a codesystem resource, you have "made" a real code system representation and any concepts included should be considered real concepts in the code system and they should validate normally. </li>
<li>I disagree with Lloyd's presumption that a content=fragment is expected to be a well-formed subset or sub-hierarchy of the code system. A fragment is what it says, a not-complete set of concepts from the code system. To my mind "example" subsets of code systems maintained elsewhere are not example code systems, they are fragments of a code system defined elsewhere (potentially as a FHIR resource, but not necessary.) Again, if you point to that resource for validation, if the code exists, it validates. If it does not, then warning is appropriate. </li>
<li>Given the above, Id assume that all existing FHIR code system resources with content=example are likely either experimental plus complete, or are fragments. There is no need for content=example. let's remove the problem by fixing our content.</li>

<p>Let's talk about the use-cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>we have a use-case for subsets of codes where the subset represents a logical "partition" of the set of codes.  This might be for maintenance reason (different partitions maintained by different groups), size reasons (we only care about procedure codes, not other codes, so want to publish a lighter weight version to save bandwidth/storage/memory), or licensing (we distribute the 'free' codes as a separate distribution so that those can be easily downloaded/used).  In all of these cases, for a particular use, the codes in the partition are 'sufficient and useful' for real-world validation</li>
<li>we have a use-case where we can't/don't want to distribute the whole set of codes (typically size or licensing), but we want to a) give an idea of the kinds of codes that exist in the system and/or b) want to be able to validate the codes in our example instances.  However, the set of codes is NOT sufficient to use to validate instances in any real-world production environment.  (You might get lucky and be able to validate a few codes you see in production, but you couldn't count on validating many/any</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are not the same use-case and it's useful to distinguish which you have.  The first are useful for production terminology servers to have if they don't have the full code system available.  The latter are only useful for 'publication' terminology servers.  They have essentially no utility for production servers.</p>
<p>We have <em>no</em> use-case for a code system that represents a subset of codes from another code system, where that subset of codes aren't expected to actually be valid codes from the base code system.  It may be that the current wording of 'example' doesn't specifically exclude that scenario, but given that there's zero value in that scenario, it seems reasonable to close that loophole and make it explicit that's not allowed.</p>

<p>If you have a code system where the details aren't worked out yet, then the status is 'draft' and the content is 'complete'.  If you haven't worked out what subset of codes you're going to include, that's fine.  It can still be 'draft' and can be 'example', but the codes that you've included (for now) darn well better be valid codes.</p>

<p>If the only thing you have for a code system is a content='example' instance, then you'd be able to validate a tiny subset of codes.  It's not super useful, but it's better than nothing.  It's certainly not 'dangerous' to have it in production.  (Or at least, it won't be so long as we agree that content=example doesn't mean that the codes can be invalid.)</p>

<p>Let me flesh out the second scenario a bit.  We have a spec that references X12 codes.  X12 requires a license to access their terminologies.  However, they give us permission to publish 10 codes that show the breadth and level of detail that implementers can expect, and we can create validatable examples so long as we stick to those 10 codes.  A license is till needed to use those codes in real systems.  That's the sort of use 'example' was envisioned for.</p>

<p>The issue is real.  There's no way X12 will let us expose all of their codes in a FHIR publication.  That's not going to change.  They could theoretically let us expose 10 or so codes.  content=example is <em>only</em> really useful on the publication side of things.  It's not something I'd ever expect to see used or sought on the implementation side.</p>

<p>I agree that the need for a subset of codes made available as a sample subset is definitely real. We are working with a code system used to describe social services - 211LA - where providing a sample we can display and include in specs may be all we get. But identifying this as "Example" is not useful as a content description where as it is <strong>exactly</strong> the same as a fragment because <em>it is a fragment</em> that happens to also be, in this case, an IP-defined sample of the full set. I agree with Lloyd's use cases but I see no justification for the use of "Example" as a content type, normative or not. The idea that you have a sample set that is restricted due to IP would - must - be noted in the copyright section. So I have not heard a single compelling reason to use "Example" content designation. In fact, it is confusing and burdensome because you have to treat it as a fragment.</p>

<p>The need for sample (I like that word for use-case 2 as well), is real for specifications that are more general-use.

<p>true made-up codes are also equally only going to be useful in higher level specifications, and would be totally unacceptable in a regional deployment specification. But I do think that there are cases where a fully made-up set of codes is used is a very high level specification. Certainly would be true with logical models.  But I think this valueSet would need to be very well marked to show that it is not production worthy in any way, and would never be used to validate. This last clause is the hard one, but is important. I am sure we all have seen someone using purely made-up codes in a production system, because that code was part of an example.  -- is this type of valueSet part of the discussion?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span> The difference is really the scope of the sample.  "Example" is a sample of codes intended for human review and to support publishing, but nothing else.  "Fragment" is a sample intended to be sufficient for production use where all that's needed is a particular subset.  I think that differentiating between those two is useful to real-world systems.</p>
<p>Note that value sets aren't impacted by complete vs. fragment vs. example code systems.  ValueSets are defined against the 'system' in general.  The terminology server will grab the 'complete' code system if it can.  If it can't, it'll grab fragments or, worst case, examples.  In the latter two cases, it can determine that codes are valid, but it can't determine that codes are invalid.  Value sets are never defined as specifically being against a fragment or example CodeSystem instance.  However, the expansions may end up being generated against one.</p>

I'm not familiar with any specific examples in Canada (where I'm from), but that doesn't mean there aren't any.  I'm sure there are examples in other corners of the world.  Quite frankly, 10 years ago, there could have been similar issues with someone else publishing HL7's v2 codes.</p>

<p>There are <strong>M A N Y</strong> code system resource instances out there that are not complete, yet are not "a curated subset released for a specific purpose under the governance of the code system steward, and that the intent, bounds and consequences of the fragmentation are clearly defined in the fragment or the code system documentation."

<p>No, I know of a some where that is not the case - and 'fragment' has intentionally been used in a broader sense (mainly because that was what was needed and there really wasn't any other obvious way to do it).  There are some of those in <a href="http://tx.fhir.org">tx.fhir.org</a>.

<p>Even if we broaden the definition of 'fragment', is there utility in differentiating between fragments that are intended for publication purposes only (i.e. a smattering of example codes) vs. fragments that are truly a "curated subset released for a specific purpose with clearly defined intent, bounds and consequences" defined that are intended to support implementation (whether managed by the code system steward or not)?  My assumption was that terminology servers would care about that difference.  If they don't, I'm happy to deprecate 'example' and clarify that fragment can be broader.</p>

<p>You don't want content=example for example code systems.  If you're making up an example code system, content should be "complete", URL should reflect that it's an example-only (I like "example-do-not-use" as part of the URL), and experimental should be true.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> My position on this is Example as a content type <strong>is not needed</strong> because, and Lloyd is now coming to the same conclusion, if you make up a code system resource with codes in it to be used as "example ideas", then your "example" code system is "content = complete" and it is my opinion that you should also set "experimental = T". I'd support including "example" in the defining url so its intended use is clear, as Lloyd has requested. </p>
<p>I say this in part because, as others have also noted, "content = fragment" is already used in a broader way, in <a href="http://tx.fhir.org">tx.fhir.org</a> and I suspect other places such as IGs, to mean "just a subset of the full code system." I see no need to identify that that subset is "officially curated by the steward" (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> , that is the wording and it's pretty restrictive) and have not heard any use case to support keeping it worded that way.</p>

<p>I think we do need a way to define useful code system 'fragments' that are "user defined" - not only ones that are specifically created by the code system owner.  Even if they are created "under the rules approved by the code system owner", that's not particularly helpful if the code system owner hasn't actually created any rules for this - unless there is also a clause that states something like "if the code system owner has not defined rules for the creation and use of fragments of the code system, then users may define and use fragments that meet their specific needs".  It seems like this is something that shouldn't be entirely (and probably often unnecessarily) prohibited.</p>

<p>for me, the difference is in intent: a fragment is meant to be useful for some use case, comprehensive. For instance, an edition distribution of SCT. Consult the document, check the intent of the fragment, go ahead and use it for the intent. In production.</p>
<p>An example, on the other hand, makes no claim of suitability for any use in production at all. Here's some example codes for this code system. The intent is clear: if you want to use this code system for anything, you need to go and find usable content. </p>

<p>I understand you are focused on <em>usability in production systems</em> as the value proposition but I'm struggling to understand how that is really useful. Are you are saying that a production server, when given multiple resources to choose from for the same code system would  not pick a resource to use that is content example and instead go searching for one that is complete or a fragment, and if there are multiple, pick the one with the largest set of concepts? What if the bigger one is content = example? ignore it? I think the question of what code system resources should production servers copy into their environment is a much more complicated question then this, and example <em>would still have real concepts</em> just like a fragment, ie, it's a distinction without a difference. If the FHIR server is using a TS and wants to know, is the code system you have an example or fragment - why does it matter??</p>

<p>The main difference is that if a TS understands the scope of the fragment and of the value set, it can (in some cases at least) make a positive assertion of "this code is not valid".  E.g. if you have a fragment that is all SNOMED procedure codes from the U.S. and you have a value set that is "all U.S. SNOMED codes that are specializations of heart surgery" (forgive the example), then if a code is sent and isn't found in the code system, you know it's not valid against the value set, even if you can't definitively say it's not a valid SNOMED code overall.  On the other hand, if you had a content=example code system, you can't make any assertions at all about a code that isn't found because there's no logical organization to the subset of codes you have.</p>
<p>That said, we don't have a computable mechanism right now that expresses the basis for a fragment - that would need to be passed as an extension.  So executing this sort of logic would require TS knowledge that isn't represented in the FHIR artifacts.

<p>Folks, For a group that frequently evokes "that is not how systems do it now" defense to justify maintaining the use of an approach that we'd like to change, this seems pretty hypocritical to demand alignment with a imagined use case that is not supported by existing systems.
