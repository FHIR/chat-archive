<p>For the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/Healthedata1/US-Core/" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/ig/Healthedata1/US-Core/">US Core IG</a> we have defined icd-10-pcs as a code system.  where would I get the source for icd-10pc to install in GG teminology server?  What licensing or copyright things are involved.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191709">@David Teirney</span> I don't think that an <a href="http://icd10data.com" target="_blank" title="http://icd10data.com">icd10data.com</a> url is the right way to go with this, as that's a commercial service and definitely not the code system owner or an officially authoritative source.  That still leaves the question of what the right url is, though - I guess with the precedent we've already been following and as you suggested it would be <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-pcs" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-pcs">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-pcs</a>.   Any different suggestions from anyone?</p>

<p>I have been using <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm</code> in our application as well.</p>
<p>I think my only confusion would be the fact that there are different region versions of icd10. For example, I am using the US version, but that doesn't change the uri at all. I see good and bad reasons to keep the url the same, but haven't really bothered too much as it seems everyone is just using that uri for any use of icd10.</p>

<p>This is icd-10-pcs, which is a US-specific standard for procedure coding.  It has some relation (at least in spirit) to ICD-10, but none of it is from WHO and it's really a different thing, and it doesn't have anything directly in common or related to icd-10-cm at all (other than that CMS publishes both).</p>

<p>So far as I am aware, and seen, for ICD code systems across all varients, the string identifiaction is always ICD-9-xxx or ICD-10-xxx (and presumabaly will be ICD-11-xxx.) Where xxx is the particular varient  defined. In the USA there are two - ICD-10-CM, and ICD-10-PCS. In Canada it is ICD-10-CA,  In Germany it is ICD-10-GM, etc. Until the USA CMS decides to take ownership of the ICD url for FHIR (and beyond?) it makes sense that HL7/FHIR provide it. This does raise the issue that these urls can change over time when the "owner/authority" decides to take over hosting. I think we've already had that occur for something.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span> sounds like there is support for <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-pcs" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-pcs">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-pcs</a> being the URL.

<p>I'm just wondering what the license angle looks like. They look free, smell free, but there's no open license or any other language that I can see telling people what they're allowed to do with them.</p>

<p>I'm a bit surprised that we've still not made clear that HTA is responsible for referencing external code systems and everyone should look on the HTA page to find the latest information, not the FHIR build. Someday we'll get it all there but not yet. Please follow the guidance at <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TA/ICD-10+Procedure+Coding+System">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TA/ICD-10+Procedure+Coding+System</a> and if you can not find what you need there, enter a comment at the bottom of the page and ask HTA to help. And when you go there you will find the official FHIR url of  <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10">https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10</a> which we all are less than pleased with.</p>

<p>We're still working on process and cleanup of the HTA content.  Where the content has been defined in the FHIR spec, that's what has to be used.  The intention is eventually to have the THO site be the source of truth - once we ensure it's: a) correct; b) maintained by a process that ensures URLs don't change once issued; and c) meet the criteria that ensures they're appropriate for implementer use.</p>

I will use the URL referenced in the link above and see if it will validate.  A pointer to the confluence page above would be helpful to those seeking answers here: <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/icd.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/icd.html</a>.    Perhaps adding a statement in section 4.3.11.2 ICD-10 variants for ICD-10-pcs?  Just a thought.  I appreciate your guidance.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> As we've discussed multiple times, these two locations for content should not be in conflict. Are you suggesting they are? In addition, the FHIR community has been notified in every way that FMG has allowed, that external code system information is managed by HTA. Perhaps we should be allowed to update all the "using FHIR" pages as Zabrina suggests.</p>

<p>There were places where there was inconsistency.  There was supposed to be a review to update the HTA recommendations to align with what FHIR mandates, but I haven't heard that that's happened yet.  Once the process is finalized and there's trust that HTA won't change URLs - regardless of the desires of the terminology source and once URLs are all accurately reflected in THO, then the FHIR specification should simply point to THO.</p>
