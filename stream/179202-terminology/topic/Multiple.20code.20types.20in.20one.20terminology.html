<p>can we have more than one code type in a code system? e.g. you can have a 2-letter and 3-letter code for languages and countries, possibly within the same codesystem. snomed ct has a conceptid, snomedid and ctv3id for the same concept (though the former is the preferred and will be maintained in the long run). this topic was tangentially referred to in the 'MDC question' topic, but I wanted to create a separate topic for this</p>

<p>It seems like it was more than tangentially discussed, since the later posts in the 'MDC question' topic get into the depth of the issue of multiple code types (which I think is similar to having identifier schemes for a patient), as well as duplicate concepts (which violates the recommended principle of concept uniqueness). So, I'm fine with discussing the multiple code types issue under the other topic.</p>
<p>Let's retire this topic and continue discussion here (identifying and inactivating/superseding duplicate, since I'm a terminologist :) ) - <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/terminology/subject/MDC.20question/near/101892" target="_blank" title="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/terminology/subject/MDC.20question/near/101892">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/terminology/subject/MDC.20question/near/101892</a></p>

<p>We can continue the discussion on the MDC thread - although it might be a lot easier to find and refer to it in the future if it’s under this topic (rather than for MDC specifically).</p>
