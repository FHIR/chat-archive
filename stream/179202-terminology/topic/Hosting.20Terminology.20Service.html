<p>In a traditional FHIR implementation do we always setup a separate Terminology Service ? Like in cloud implementations Google , Azure.  If so do then we need to load all the reference data external and internal to this server and manage this dataset with licenses etc.  Is there another path to have code lookups done ?</p>

<p>You're free to have terminology functions done internally.  The notion of an external terminology service is only appealing if you have more sophisticated terminology requirements (e.g. subsumption testing) and don't want to take on the job of doing that efficiently yourself.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="394125">@Eddie Shah</span> Yes, if you host and manage all the needed content for an IG internally within your FHIR server, you must meet all the IP requirements for all the IP-constrained code systems. You don't need a terminology service to do that and using one that is external doesn't change the need to meet IP requirements for <em>use</em>. As Lloyd noted, if you take on terminology internally, you just have to do all the needed things yourself, like maintenance, updating, and providing all functionality you require, like subsumption and expansions.</p>

<p>1: One question would be is before writing data. into FHIR the records from source system either need lookups to code systems like NDC's, SNOWMED-CT , LIONC etc If i am not using external API's to validate does that mean i have to get the licenses and manage the codes locally for lookups ? <br>
2: Also for custom codes will they be stored in FHIR server itself if the volume is low like under 1000. codes ? also do i need a canonical url for the custom code as well ?</p>
