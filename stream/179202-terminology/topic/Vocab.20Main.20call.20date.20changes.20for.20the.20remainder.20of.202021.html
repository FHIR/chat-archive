<p>In order to avoid multiple holiday and other conflicts, we have decided to move the remaining 3 Vocab Main calls for 2021 each one week earlier - so the next Vocab Main call will be <strong>this week</strong> on Thursday November 18th (instead of the 25th), followed by calls on December 2nd (instead of the 9th) and December 16th (instead of the 23rd).  The call on the 16th will be the final call for this year.  Then we will skip the following 2 weeks (the 23rd and 30th), and the first call in January will be back on the previous alternating week schedule on January 6th.  We know that this change could cause problems for some of you, but we expect that it should solve a lot more problems than it creates, so that is the plan and the HL7 conference call calendar has been updated accordingly.</p>
