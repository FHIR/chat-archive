<p>I would like to know, in the real world, who is actually using FHIR terminology servers in their FHIR work?<br>
 When is it actually worth building and using?  <br>
And if people are doing FHIR without FHIR terminology servers (which I am guessing is more the norm) how are they dealing with terminology - I assume whatever they have locally? <br>
Do we see terminology servers playing a key role in any of the FHIR accelerator projects?<br>
Thanks.</p>

<p>yes people are actually using terminology servers - and not just for FHIR implementions; it's intended to be used for system support generally. You can implement FHIR or your system without a terminology server, and most systems that were already developed don't have a terminology service. But they'll have a higher a maintenance cost going forward</p>

<p>We have quite a few commercial customers for our terminology server (Ontoserver), with a varied range of use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>data entry (using <code>ValueSet/$expand?filter=[search text]</code>)</li>
<li>$validate (data ingress / ESB-like scenarios)</li>
<li>$translate (for report generation; mapping clinical codes to reporting categories)</li>
<li>a "central" point for all terminology content in a consistent form</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of this is initially driven by a need to use SNOMED CT, and then being able to have a single unified API for interacting with all terminology content.<br>
As <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> says, this is not just for FHIR ecosystems - there's use in non-FHIR environments and even OpenEHR</p>

<p>Looking for help in building the case for it so thanks.</p>
