<p><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset.html#invs">Invariant  vsd-1</a> when created was intended to require that within ValueSet.compose.include when a valueSet.compose.include.valueSet reference exists, ValueSet.compose.include.system should not be populated. In other words the invariant was intended to be an exclusive OR between valueSet.compose.include.system and valueSet.compose.include.valueSet reference. This is noted in <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30585">Jira 30585</a>. We are concerned that some users may have misinterpreted the “or” in the Description and the Expression as the non-exclusive (intersection) type or that exists in the Expression. The intent in R4B is to change both the description and the Expression to clarify that this is indeed an XOR. </p>
<p>We are seeking input from the community to determine if anyone has real use cases where the current non-XOR approach is needed. If such a use case exists we also need to understand how this was implemented. There appear to be two potential choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>The valueSet.compose.include.system (potentially with version) restricts the included members from the referenced value set to only the expansion members that match the system+/-version.</li>
<li>The valueSet.compose.include.system (potentially with version) forces the included expansion members <em>of that system</em> from the referenced value set to match the system+/-version, <em>but does not exclude expansion members from other code systems.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We intend to <strong>make this change to XOR in R4B</strong> as a clarifying change but due to it technically being non-conformant, we need users to contact us with concerns by replying to this thread. <br>

<p>We used the machine-readable definition: <code>valueSet.exists() or system.exists()</code> as the basis for our implementation specifically to avoid the ambiguity surrounding natural-language use of "or".<br>
The semantics we implemented follows the rule "Within an <code>include</code>, all the criterion apply -e.g. the value set contains the intersection of the criterion".  Thus we restrict the expansion to just those members that match the system+/-version.<br>
If a version is specified, then it may also influence any default version selection (i.e., where the $expand call and other uses of the same CodeSystem do not specify a version).</p>

<p>I would like to understand the motivation for making this change.  Granted, the spec may not say what was originally intended, but there's a perfectly reasonable and clear semantics driven by the rule "Within an include, all the criterion apply -e.g. the value set contains the intersection of the criterion", so why suddenly make currently legal things illegal?</p>

<p>It is also a pretty convenient way of sub-setting an existing multi-system ValueSet.<br>
The alternative would be to just add an additional <code>include.valueSet</code> URI using the "all codes in the CodeSystem" valueSet and you should get the same semantics.</p>

<p>A further undesirable effect of making this change is that intersecting an explicit list of codes with a ValueSet expansion becomes more cumbersome.<br>
For example, I may have a list of unique codes drawn from clinical data and wish to identify which of these codes belong to a specific ValueSet (perhaps for cohort selection).  While I could issue a series of $validate-code calls, it would be much more efficient to construct a ValueSet with a single include.valueSet and include.concepts and then POST it.</p>

<p>Rather than the change that is being suggested, clarifying and making explicit the "within an include, all the criterion apply" rule that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191343">@Michael Lawley</span> described would likely be a better (and certainly more compatible) path forward.</p>

<p>We don't have any specific values sets including system and valueSet in the same include but I'd seen it as way to refine a valueSet by a system. This seems a reasonable thing to do.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191343">@Michael Lawley</span> So you have chosen one of the two alternative approaches based on this being a intersecting OR, giving "full weight" to the impact of including a single system. To be clear, that was not the intent, hence the motivation. The edge-case use of this is essentially theoretical and "illegality" has nothing to do with it. The only use case I see is the ability to restrict the expansion of a multi-system value set.  Are you saying you have <strong>real examples</strong> of this, or are just musing about the possibility? Your last theoretical advantage makes no sense to me and I don't see how this intersection OR of a system does something to support whatever you want. Of course clarifying the current ambiguous approach is more compatible for Michael, as long as someone else doesn't come in and say they interpreted this the other way.  </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192027">@Liam Barnes</span> By "refine" which of the alternatives noted in the OP are you referring to?</p>

<p>Right.  As I see it then, there are three options going forward:</p>
<ol>
<li>clarify the OR semantics as "intersectional"</li>
<li>clarify the OR semantics as "version-narrowing"</li>
<li>clarify the "XOR, NOT BOTH" semantics</li>
</ol>
<p>We have implemented 1., and have ongoing significant use-cases that rely on this semantic, which is also (I argue) directly supported by wording in the spec.<br>
We've yet to see anyone (here) indicate preference for, or implementation of 2.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>says the combination would be explicitly not allowed (what I meant by "illegal" above).  As I understand it, this was the original intent, but I don't understand why it is a desirable outcome?</li>

<p>I think it's unclear if #3 was the original "intent".  I think it possibly may have been the original "expectation", though never expressed as a requirement, but I'm also not certain of that.  I believe that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> is likely the only person who can (probably) answer the original intent question.  But, as I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191343">@Michael Lawley</span> is expressing, even if we can answer the intent question, I'm not sure if now that is or should be <strong>the</strong> deciding factor or one of the highest priority factors for deciding how we should go forward with this.</p>

<p>I think that the intent was that you would have one or the other. But I can definitely see cases where value set designers choose to use system to ensure that they only get a subset of concepts in the included value set. I myself would say that this is not good design. and I expect that <a href="http://tx.fhir.org">tx.fhir.org</a> wouldn't handle this as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191343">@Michael Lawley</span> says his one does, which I agree is what is stated. </p>
<p>So I favor, given that this is normative, #1</p>
