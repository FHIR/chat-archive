<p>In our legacy Coverage file, there are 4 different fields for subscriber relationship to patient (original, hipaa, ncpdp (2)). I think we can call these different representations of a single relationship, so we can populate the 0..1 CodeableConcept with 4 Codings with different systems. Right?</p>

<p>If they're all representing the same relationship, that's fine.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191985">@Jay Lyle</span> I think you should provide an example or two. I'm struggling to imagine a situation where some sort of concept from each of those areas (original, hippa, NCPDP, NCPDP) can all represent the same idea.</p>

<p>Ok - so I think what you are saying is as an example, that relationship element for a single instance might have HIPAA 01, NCPDP 1, original s.  If so then I agree with Lloyd, you can put all three in that example into one codableconcept. You'll need to define a code system for each and keep in mind that these are all external code systems so if a standards IG you need to get HTA to represent the metadata. And we'll need to clarify the IP for NCPDP. I'd guess HIPAA is actually VA-HIPPA?</p>
