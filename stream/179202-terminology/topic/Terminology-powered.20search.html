<p>From discussion on the DaVinci "Formulary IG" call, they have a use case where a "Formulary Item" describes the details of how a particular drug is included in a formulary. Logically the "Formulary Item" says things like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"acetaminophen 325 MG / oxycodone hydrochloride 5 MG Oral Tablet" is covered on Formulary A with a quantity limit of 60 pills per 30 days</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, they want to support things like searching by various brand/generic names or different dose forms. All this information lives in vocabularies like RxNorm, but it's not easy to <em>search</em>, so instead of just listing an RxNorm code in the Formulary Item, the IG adds a <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-formulary/use_cases_and_overview.html#resource-relationships">new resource called "Formulary Drug"</a> -- a profile on MedicationKnowledge that basically acts an an "index" for drug properties (name, generic equivalents, dose forms, etc). This pattern is useful because it lets you use search params to find, say, brand name drugs via a query like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code> /Basic?code=formulary-item&amp;subject.drug-name=percocet&amp;doseform=tablet
</code></pre></div>

<p>... but <strong>it strikes me that this pattern  (creating a FormularyDrug resource to staple together terminology details into a resource, to enable search) is creating a whole new problem</strong> -- lots of state to manage, even when the underlying data already exist in terminologies (concepts, hierarchies, properties, etc). It would be nicer if a <code>FormularyItem</code> could just list a drug (say, by RxNorm code) and queries could ask these kinds of questions directly against the FormularyItem.</p>

<p>In other words, it'd be nice to write queries like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>/Basic?code=formulary-item&amp;drug:terminology=(rxnorm.type = SBD, rxnorm.doseform = Tablet, rxnorm.preferredTerm ~ Percocet)
</code></pre></div>

<p>(Never mind my ad-hoc syntax, hopefully you understand the kind of thing I mean.)</p>
<p>Has there been discussion about this kind of capability, pushing terminology details (beyond above/below) into queries? (It's something the semantic web stack expresses really well, but I'm wondering if there's some practical application in FHIR too. </p>

<p>We provide Concept resource with first-class extensions - i.e. rxnorm can be loaded with extra info. Custom resources can be used for formulary item, and query is quite trivial join with our SQL on FHIR</p>

<p>Thanks!  Do you support a generic kind of query syntax where anytime you are searching by "token" type search parameter, there is a way to leverage properties from a terminology? And if you're defining a custom resource can it be (essentially) just a "materialized view" on a terminology? Or are you thinking about another model for supporting a Formulary Drug?</p>

<p>These are the kinds of things you can do with ECL for snomed (which translate directly to an implicit valueset URI).<br>
I've long thought a similar capability (and syntax) that approximates the Valuset compose functionality would be a great addition to FHIR Terminology services</p>

<p>Interesting <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191343">@Michael Lawley</span> ! Do you have any thoughts about what a good starting point for this would look like? And what do you think about the idea of surfacing this as a capability within FHIR search?</p>



<a name="275448026"></a>
<h4><a href="https://chat.fhir.org#narrow/stream/179202-terminology/topic/Terminology-powered%20search/near/275448026" class="zl"><img src="https://fhir.github.io/chat-archive/assets/img/zulip.svg" alt="view this post on Zulip" style="width:20px;height:20px;"></a> Michael Lawley <a href="https://fhir.github.io/chat-archive/stream/179202-terminology/topic/Terminology-powered.20search.html#275448026">(Mar 15 2022 at 23:08)</a>:</h4>
<p>I see the main use-case for such a VCL (ValueSet  Constraint/Compose Language) as being the basis for implicit valueset URIs much as ECL can be used to specify them of the form <code>http://snomed.info/sct?fhir_vs=ecl/[ECL]</code>.</p>
<p>So, off the top of my head, I'd limit to a single codesystem (based on the base of said URI), and focus on simple &amp; common aspects of ValueSet.compose functionality, building from the existing ECL syntax pattern:<br>
<code>[focus] : [property] [op] [value]</code><br>
where <code>[focus]</code> includes <code>*</code> as a wildcard, and <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code> etc operators for  hierarchy traversal, and then add in simple AND / OR / MINUS and bracketing to compose sub-expressions.</p>
<p>The would give you things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;!  LP43571-6 MINUS 5932-9</code> (equivalent of <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/example-intensional">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/example-intensional</a>)</li>
<li><code>&lt;&lt; _ActClassROI MINUS _ActClassROI</code> (equivalent of <a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActClassROI">http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActClassROI</a>), but more simply: <code>&lt; _ActClassROI</code></li>
<li><code>* : {{ C STATUS = ACTIVE, CLASSTYPE = 1, CLASS != regex:"CYTO|HL7\\.CYTOGEN|HL7\\.GENETICS|^PATH(\\..*)?|^MOLPATH(\\..*)?|NR STATS|H&amp;P\\.HX\\.LAB|CHALSKIN|LABORDERS" }}</code> (equivalent of <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/ValueSet/results-laboratory-observations-uv-ips">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/ValueSet/results-laboratory-observations-uv-ips</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one is perhaps stretching what might be needed in practice, but is a real-world example and shows how property filters would be expressed.  The others just constrain based on hierarchy.</p>
<p>Finally, one might introduce the rule for implicit ValueSets that allows <code>[uri]?vcl=[expression]</code> to be used as an implicit valueset for the CodeSystem where <code>[uri]</code> is the "all code ValueSet", ie. the value of <code>CodeSystem.valueSet</code></p>

<p>Cool! I like the idea of exposing the same machinery (or a subset) as ValueSet definitions inline. I'll try to write out examples from the RxNorm cases above.</p>

<p>So if you wanted to find meds that included tylenol you could do a query using the generic (161) and branded (202433) ingredients like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>MedicationUsage?code=(tty in [&#39;scd&#39;, &#39;sbd&#39;], has_ingredient in [161, 202433])
</code></pre></div>

<p>... though I'm not sure how to say "we're talking about RxNorm". I'm also not quite sure how to write a search over concept names (e.g., preferred terms or synonyms that match "tylenol") based on the properties defined in <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/rxnorm.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/rxnorm.html</a> (I haven't worked with this page in the FHIR spec before, and the syntax is not super clear to me, so I may just be misunderstanding)</p>

<p>For what I was brainstorming above, the ValueSet URI would be something like:<br>
<code>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/vs?vcl=*: has_ingredient =  (161 OR 202433) {{ C tty = ("scd"  "sbd") }}</code><br>
with appropriate %-encoding.</p>
<p>This is saying match any (<code>*</code>) RxNorm code (<code>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/vs</code> is the all-codes valueset) with a <code>has_ingredient</code> relationship to either of the codes 161 or 202433 and a <code>tty</code> property of "scd" or "sbd".</p>
<p>If you want to limit matches to those with "tylenol" in the display/designation text, then you would append a clause like <code>{{ D term="tylenol" }}</code></p>
<p>( I'm basing all this on a straightforward re-use of SNOMED's ECL - <a href="http://snomed.org/ecl">http://snomed.org/ecl</a> )</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>  You can add first-class extensions to Concept resource with rxnorm and formulary item  attrs, then define search params for it.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191343">@Michael Lawley</span> thanks, those references are helpful. I'll read up on the ECL syntax (it's not totally transparent at first, which is fair).

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191318">@nicola (RIO/SS)</span> yes, I'm thinking about a world where a FHIR server generically "loads RxNorm" to support diverse use cases -- not specifically to populate a FormularyDrug resource or a ReconciliationRecommendation in particular, but in a way that <em>any search on any Coding</em> can ask questions like the ones above.</p>
<p>Maybe it'd be good to work through similar examples with your architecture. How would a client ask for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All MedicationUsage resources where patient is 123 and the drug code is an RxNorm code with "tylenol" or "acetaminophen" as part of the preferred name?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All MedicationUsage resources where patient is 123 and the drug code is an RxNorm code that "has_ingredient"  of RxNorm CUI 161 or 202433?</p>

<p>Folks, we've bantered about a generic terminology query and representation syntax and it's never gotten anywhere. Apelon DTS uses "TQL" and obviously SCT uses ECL. I strongly agree that we need to expose a common general hierarchical and filter-based query syntax for use in defining value sets and performing inline queries as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> wants.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> Yes, I've used the filters from <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/rxnorm.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/rxnorm.html</a>, and in general I would expect any filter to be usable since a design goal would be that all expressions are transformable into an explicit <code>ValueSet.compose</code> element.  However the expressions above don't depend on subsumption wrt properties, only wrt the concepts themselves.</p>
<p>Wrt syntax, SNOMED's ECL was modelled on its post coordination syntax which makes a lot of sense in that domain. It's also quite succinct.<br>
It doesn't quite seamlessly translate to FHIR CodeSystems since it distinguishes concept properties and concept relationships (properties that reference other concepts in the same CodeSystem), distinguishes concept properties from designation properties (hence the <code>{{C</code> and <code>{{D</code> parts of the syntax), and doesn't cover all the FHIR datatypes (eg Coding).<br>
We could probably define a prettier syntax, but coming from SNOMED-land, I like the idea of building something that's aligned with an existing domain-oriented syntax because there's less to learn.  It's also an implementation-independent syntax (i.e., doesn't leak out relational table design elements).</p>
<p>Wrt <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191318">@nicola (RIO/SS)</span> 's point of new syntaxes, ad hoc or not, his approach depends on a new Resource and associated additional extensions, which could also be labelled ad hoc :-). I'm not sure why, in such an approach, you'd need to introduce extensions to carry the rxnorm attrs; I would have expected generic attrs to be a fundamental aspect of such a Concept Resource?<br>
However, use still requires some way to "chain" through a code/concept.  This pushes a pile of implementation logic into the FHIR Server itself, rather than leaving it all in the terminology subsystem sitting in an existing re-usable abstraction (ValueSet).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span> wrt TQL, I think the advantage here is that we'd be looking at an 80% approach that doesn't try to get at every possible underlying aspect of a code system, but rather covers off the core parts that are exposed using <strong>existing ValueSet functionality</strong>.  This would be my argument as to why this might get traction where other things remain niche / proprietary -- an open syntax that compiles down to existing standard capability that could even be provided as part of the standard libraries.</p>

<p>I'm quite interested in how well a "regular FHIR server" (as opposed to a specialty terminology server) could join together clinical resources with (standardized / consistently modeled) concept tables to support this kind of thing. Of course, maybe the answer is "send the terminology piece to a terminology subsystem to resolve it into a set of concepts first" -- but with this approach you don't have the advantage of query optimization across the clinical and terminology data. </p>
<div class="spoiler-block"><div class="spoiler-header">
</div><div class="spoiler-content" aria-hidden="true">
<p>Is that at all clear? What I mean is: some queries match a tiny number of clinical data rows and a huge number of terminology rows, like</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Observation?_id=123&amp;code:tx=(*: {term=&quot;*e*&quot;})
</code></pre></div>

<p>which asks whether observation 123 has a concept with any description containing "e".</p>
<p>Whereas other queries match a huge number of clinical data rows and a tiny number of terminology rows, like </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Observation?code:tx=(*: {{term=&quot;*excited*&quot;})

<p>I guess I am assuming that 1. a "regular FHIR Server" already needs to support queries like <code>Observation.code:in=http://example.com/SomeValueset</code> and this proposal would leverage that capability, 2. if it doesn't, then both approaches require a bunch of server-side implementation.  It would not be hard for a server to recognise a trailing <code>?vcl=...</code> in a valueset URI and do local evaluation as an optimisation step (both approaches would require the raw terminology data to be available in the data server).</p>

<p>In terms of optimisation, the FHIR (data) server can always (internally) compute the unique set of codes for <code>Observation.code</code> (which will be much smaller than the # unique Observation records) and then dynamically compose a ValueSet with these codes and the (compiled) VCL expression as an intersection resulting in a single call to the terminology server, and avoids the blowout in # of codes matching the unconstrained query.  Also, if desired/needed, the set of unique <code>Observation.code</code> values could be maintained incrementally rather than being computed on-demand.</p>

<p>Thanks for the info on SCT non concept relationships!</p>
<p>For (1) some servers do ":in" today but don't have all the data or infrastructure in place to support more sophisticated queries.  I'm thinking that the more we can support "raw terminology data" (with properties and relationships packaged and distributed in ways that facilitate querying "at the edge") in all kinds of FHIR services, the more choices server developers have about how to optimize.</p>

<p>I think a key aspect is that if a server also has the relevant terminology data available locally (even for only some code systems), this approach is not really a stretch -- I'd probably limit the syntax to non-nested constraints in the first instance (since, as you say, most terminologies don't have intra-code system relationships), and then it would be pretty straightforward to turn into SQL with the main requirement being that you have parent-child edge and path (transitive closure) tables available if the code system has hierarchy.</p>

<p>One other bit of semantics for RxNorm: relationships are described between atoms asserted by various sources and it would make sense to surface the "source" as a restriction on attribute queries. I.e. a way to request not just "any concept with property x having value y" but more specifically, "any concept with property x having value y as asserted by source z". (Syntactically this could use an optional "sab=" clause similar to the description filters in ECL taking optional clauses like "lang=" in <code>{{term="", lang=""}}</code>. But does FHIR CodeSystem have a way to assert such properties of properties?)</p>

<p>hah!  FHIR Tx has a way to return subproperties (I think of them as grouped properties), but currently no way in the FHIR CodeSystem resource to specify such things.<br>
SCT has them (for historical reasons its call "role grouping") and a server is supposed to know how to do this stuff (since its accepted that their isnt' a FHIR CodeSystem rendering of SCT).</p>
<p>I'm not really across RxNorm details, but I don't recall the rxnorm page saying anything about grouping a set of properties with another that is the source of their assertion.  However, if one did follow this path, then ECL has syntax to suit with <code>{</code> and '}' to group the properties together (SCT and thus ECL doesn't actually care what the properties are "sub" of since it's always the same.</p>
<p>This property grouping idea also comes up in meds terminologies with multi-ingredient drugs and their associated ingredient strengths; you can't just say this thing has codeine and paracetamol and strength 50mg and strength 200mg.  To resolve this in a FHIR CodeSystem for dm+d in the UK, Ontoserver (6.7.0, due end of the month) uses some extensions to capture the grouping .  Hopefully in R5 we'll be able to add this as a 1st class capability.</p>
<p>So, these are not really properties of properties since that would be more like an association class, but it does result in a similar capability.</p>

<p>Bottom line: this was a fun diversion and FHIRpath has some interesting expressive capabilities here; it's approachable for the things it covers, but nowhere near as sophisticated as SNOMED ECL.</p>

<p>Looking back at this thread, I think the "low hanging fruit" would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>A publication format that makes it easier for servers to load common vocabularies and make use of terms, attributes, and relationships from them</li>
<li>Maybe a couple of standard modifiers on the token search param for simple jobs, like <code>:tx-term</code> that searches a token's terminology entries across all official terms, like <code>MedicationRequest?code:tx-term=acetaminophen</code>, and could specify prefixes to lock down term types or languages, like <code>code:tx-term=BN|Tylenol</code>. And a similar concept for attributes like <code>code:tx-attr=RXTERM_FORM|Tab</code> to look for tablets.</li>

<p>(1) I haven't seen how to publish large terminologies in CodeSystem with terms, attributes, and relationships included. It's possible this works; does someone host RxNorm, LOINC, and SNOMED in this format? (I was thinking formats that allow streaming processing would be preferable, but I don't think it's a strict requirement. <a href="http://tx.fhir.org/snomed/900000000000207008-20200731/?type=snomed&amp;id=*">http://tx.fhir.org/snomed/900000000000207008-20200731/?type=snomed&amp;id=*</a> seems to be broken at the moment and <a href="http://tx.fhir.org/r4/CodeSystem/snomedct?_format=json">http://tx.fhir.org/r4/CodeSystem/snomedct?_format=json</a> doesn't include concepts)</p>
<p>(2) it seems like detailed terms might just be absent from the FHIR models, or they're intended to be treated as a kind of property?  The examples from (1) would help to clarify.</p>

<p>The problem with (1) is that a SNOMED distribution (RF2 SNAPSHOT) contains a lot more stuff than just the CodeSystem; it contains Reference Sets in various formats, and a whole pile of technical (meta)data that is 99% of the time[*] irrelevant to clinical / runtime use of SNOMED, and only of interest to tool developers supporting SNOMED authoring.</p>
<p>If you're a TX developer and want to support SNOMED properly (which you should), then you need to implement the implicit ValueSets, understand grouped relationships (subproperties in FHIR) and ECL, etc.  For this you need the RF2 distribution.<br>
If you're only going to do a limited implementation, then a transform similar to the approach you did for LOINC with sqlite into a FHIR CodeSystem will get you some of the way there (subproperties would require an Extension, as we've done here: <a href="https://ontoserver.csiro.au/docs/6/ext-subproperties-cs.html">https://ontoserver.csiro.au/docs/6/ext-subproperties-cs.html</a>).</p>

<p>Right -- my assertion is that there's a common set of property based search functionality that would enable diverse use cases and could be fueled by publishing data in consistent and reasonably complete format. This pattern could work with or without a dedicated/distinct "terminology server".</p>
<p>Effectively these capabilities are <em>shy</em> of the needs that terminilogy developers might have, but similar to the use cases we already know how to index using search parameters on regular old FHIR resources. Indeed we are seeing groups like DaVinci Drug Formulary inventing FHIR resources just for this purpose, because there's no reliable access to terminology properties in search.</p>
<p>To be clear, I quickly swung away from proposing a very expressive search functionality like SNOMED ECL, in favor of proposals that are based on simple property filters.</p>

<p>I think you have one too many negatives there ;-)</p>
<p>I'm suggesting that publishing terminology data in an interoperable format that's aligned with fhir's terminology features lowers the implementation bar for servers or anyone else that wants to "do more" with terminologies. The fact that many (most?) severs today don't support <code>:in</code> even ok on simple terminologies is a symptom of the problem, and we should be offering anything we can to give severs pathways to successful implementation.</p>

<p>not generally, though I could speak in favour of that particular approach. For the big terminologis we will inevitably define resources</p>
<p>Rxnorm = MedicationKnowledge<br>
LOINC = ObservationDefinition<br>
SCT (Clinical arm) = ConditionDefinition</p>
<p>you can build a set of the resources from the terminology, and there's reasons why that's a solid arrangement, since everyone has their own formulary, observables, and condition predicates that build on and extend beyond the underlying code systems</p>

<p>Hmm, I'm not sure I understand your position. But I'm confident that not every terminology will fit neatly into these resource types (e.g., your parenthetical on SNOMED above), so we'll have more and more resources and profiles to contend with as we travel down this path.</p>

<p>going back to the start of the thread... they created a 'FormularyDrug' resource - though why they wouldn't use that resources we already had defined, I don't know. I hope that's been discussed with Pharmacy WG ( <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179249" href="/#narrow/stream/179249-Medication">#Medication</a>).</p>
<p>But I did want to ask back when I read the start of the thread: why do you think that the formulary is limited to RxNorm? that seems like a clear problem in your approach to me</p>

<p>Formulary Drug is a profile on Medication Knowledge (looking back: I did call this out when introducing the topic, but I can see it may have gotten lost) --  so that's reusing the existing resource, just with use case specific profiles, no?</p>

<p>I believe that's changing.  FormularyDrug isn't about the Medication, it's about the formulary information for a drug for a particular type of insurance.  It's a "joining" structure.</p>

<p>The current design has a FormularyItem specifying the policy details (coverage, price tiers, etc), and that points to a FormularyDrug that acts as a search index for terms/properties that exist in RxNorm, to facilitate querying for FormularyItems.</p>

<p>Hello All:<br>
I have scheduled a breakout session in the May Connectathon Terminology Services track on Tuesday 5/2, from 6-7:30p entitled "Terminology Queries &amp; Representation Syntax" and have tagged <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191343">@Michael Lawley</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> as leading the discussion. </p>
<p>The following is the session description: "The need to expose a common general hierarchical and filter-based query syntax for use in defining value sets and performing inline queries has come up yet again as evidenced by a recent Zulip chat in the Terminology stream. This session aims to provide a real-time discussion of the topic, and identify the next steps to resolution."  </p>
<p>Please suggest any alternative text for the description &amp; If I have abused your time / schedule <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> &amp; <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> by indicating you will help led this discussion - my apologies, and I'm happy to remove this designation.</p>
