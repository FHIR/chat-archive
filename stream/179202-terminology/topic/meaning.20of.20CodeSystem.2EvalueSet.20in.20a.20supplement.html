<p>If CodeSystem.valueSet has been given a value in a CodeSystem supplement (i.e., CodeSystem.supplements also has a value):</p>
<ol>
<li>is this legal</li>
<li>if so, what should it mean?</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't have a good feel for the answer to 1., but if it is yes, then I would suggest that the meaning is "all codes in the supplemented code system, supplemented by this supplement".  i.e., with all the supplement's designations and properties.</p>

<p>A supplement can't change a value set definition, it can only change the expansion contents.  As such, my preference would be to say that supplements can't have a defining value set.</p>

<p>I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> that supplements can not add concepts (per the defined intent of a supplement)  and it is concepts that the value set "definition" (ie: the scope) represents. But it is possible that the scope describes concept attributes that are only available in the supplement, therefore determining the expansion can only be done by using the supplement.</p>

<p>Certainly a supplement should not change the meaning of the existing valueset declared on the base CodeSystem, but what about a new (different) valueSet URI?<br>
If anything, it could either be all codes in the code system, with supplemented features, or just all supplemented (in this one) codes.</p>

<p>So we'd define a separate value set that is identical to the canonical value set for the base code system and only adds "and use this supplement"?  Is there really value in that?</p>

<p>Agreed, the value is possibly quite limited. But currently there is nothing said about the valueSet property in a supplement, and this leaves a grey are that really should be clarified.</p>
<p>As a potential use-case, consider a code system supplement for SNOMED CT that includes (a library of) post coordination expressions. It might be quite convenient to have the supplement's valueSet URI be usable as either: "all codes in SNOMED as well as the expressions in this supplement", or "all codes &amp; expressions in this supplement".</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191343">@Michael Lawley</span> , might be that it's Thursday of the WGM and my brain is mush,  but I'm just going to restate my understanding for any other poor souls who are trying to follow.</p>
<p>The definition of codesystem.valueset = "Canonical reference to the value set with entire code system" where "The definition of the value set SHALL include all codes from this code system and only codes from this code system, and it SHALL be immutable"<br>
while the definition of  codesystem.supplements = "Canonical URL of Code System this adds designations and properties to" </p>
<p>In your example,  that equates to a codesystem resource representing "all codes in SNOMED as well as the expressions in this supplement" via<br>
codesystem.valueset = <a href="http://snomed.info/sct">http://snomed.info/sct</a><br>
codesystem.supplements = (library of SCT post coordinated expressions)</p>
<p>Where I get lost is the "It would be quite convenient to have the  supplement's valueSet URI be usable"...are you saying you'd then use the URL for the codeystem defined above in another codesystem.valueset declaration?</p>
<p>There is still a lot of work to be done around further clarifying the use of supplements. Thus the "black box" type warning that still exists stating "The impact of Code System supplements on value set expansion - and therefore value set validation - is subject to ongoing experimentation and implementation testing, and further clarification and additional rules might be proposed in future versions of this specification." </p>
<p>Perhaps from this we could get some folks to start drafting that verbiage...</p>

<p>Perhaps it's best to avoid the SNOMED and post coordination example in the first case.<br>
Let's start with a CodeSystem, A, with URI <code>http://example.com/A</code> and valueSet URI <code>http://example.com/A/vs</code>.  This code system is in English and has codes X, and Y.<br>
Thus an expansion of <code>http://example.com/A/vs</code> returns the codes X and Y with English display text.</p>
<p>Now define a CodeSystem supplement, B, of our CodeSystem A.  The supplement will have the URI <code>http://example.com/A-sup</code>, supplements=<code>http://example.com/A</code>, a translation to Icelandic of code X, an extra property for X, and lets also set its valueSet URI to <code>http://example.com/A-sup/vs</code>.</p>
<p>So, what now should an expansion of <code>http://example.com/A-sup/vs</code> return, if anything at all?</p>
<p>I am suggesting that it should retain the "all codes from this code system and only codes from this code system" semantics, but that it should also behave as if the ValueSet included the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/valueset-supplement">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/valueset-supplement</a> extension with a reference to <code>http://example.com/A-sup</code>.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191343">@Michael Lawley</span> It took me a while to work through your phrasing of "a value set of the supplement" because I think of this as a value set that <em>uses</em> something specific drawn from the supplement and not be "the supplement value set.".  But I think we are assuming the same thing where e value set include would specify system/version  <em>of the supplement.</em>  And then I agree with  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  that things need to align, at least the code system supplement has to have all the concepts needed by the value set. </p>
<p>This does raise the real concern that this means value sets could be created that only rely upon the supplement for content meaning control of the code system content used may be suspect. Do others have this concern?</p>

<p>In Michael's example of a CodeSystem resource where the content is defined as 'supplement', the code of each post-coordinated concept contains the Compositional Grammar defining the meaning of the Concept.  That begs the question as to whether the meaning  of those concepts is defined exclusively in those codes,  and therefore in the supplement, or elsewhere.</p>

<p>A supplement can define relationships, it can't define an additional syntax.  If you want to leverage existing codes and define a post-coordinated code that draws on them, that's a new CodeSystem.  All "code" values must be recognized by the original code system, regardless of what supplements are in play.</p>

<p>OK, the concepts in the post-coordinated expressions (PCE) are valid members of the supplemented Code System - but I don't see how the concept represented by the complete PCE can be said to be in that code system. While I realize that supplements are a handy containers for PCEs, I don't see how they fit into the definition of a supplement in the spec as being ' designations or properties'. Maybe that definition is the problem and needs to be extended to include PCEs?</p>

<p>I would expect CodeSystem/$validate-code for a snomed PCE to succeed (subject to syntax etc), so I should be able to use the PCE in a supplement to, for example, supply designations.</p>

<p>Supplements can't define post-coordinated expressions.  I'm not even sure they can supplement them - we've never talked about that and I think it'd be problematic.  SNOMED doesn't allow you to define a designation for a PCE.  Why should a supplement?  Supplements don't allow you to do anything you couldn't do in the original code system if the code system author had wanted to.</p>

<p>The snomed PCG specification at least allows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automatically transforming the expression into a human-readable term using a predefined algorithm. For example, a simple algorithm may just remove the concept identifiers and nesting – e.g. "fracture of bone: finding site = arm, laterality = left". More sophisticated algorithms may use pattern matching and predefined templates to construct a more natural term – e.g. "fracture of bone in left arm";</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it should at least be allowable to record the result of such an algorithm in a supplement?</p>
<p>Also, PCEs are valid snomed codes - the supplement isn't "defining them", only using them.</p>

<p>No.  Because there's no mechanism to record the result of executing the algorithm in the base code system.  The code system allows you to list codes and display names.  It doesn't allow you to list display names for a post-coordinated expression.  A supplement is no different in that respect.</p>

<p>I'm with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191343">@Michael Lawley</span> here in agreeing that we have not, and should not, disallow codes that technically are the result of a code system defined algorithm for valid post or pre-coordinated expressions. I guarantee that users are not interested in more hurdles in using UCUM and they consider existing combinations of atoms valid codes in the UCUM code system. Regenstrief  considers the <a href="https://ucum.org/trac/wiki/adoption/common">common UCUM Units</a> list a set of UCUM codes. SNOMED can't get out of it's own way regarding the use of expressions as "real" codes but they certainly do consider an expression equivalent to a concept and assume and expression should be treated as a valid concept when determining equivalence and placement in the inferred structure. Ergo, an expression is a code in the code system. </p>
<p>As for using a supplement to hold a set of enumerated expressions, I think we need to really discuss the pros and cons of using that vehicle versus allowing this to be done in a fragment. I'd rather we found it acceptable to use fragment I think, but want to hear why supplement is better.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191343">@Michael Lawley</span>  I think we need to clarify what "Publish" means regarding fragments. FHIR servers through out the world contain code system fragment resources that exist solely on that server and no place else. IE: it seems to me that anyone can decide what subset they want and need in a resource for use and this is not only useful, it is demonstrably practical. I'd be very surprised if your server does not contain code system resources that are (or should be) marked as fragments that you did not get for the code system authority as an officially published fragment. So #1 is not practically true and it should be made clear that it is not a requirement because it's simply impossible and wrong to make this a requirement. That leaves #2 and I wondered if that was the problem so I suggest we work on clarifying what needs to change to make use of fragments for PCE the proper solution. Then the argument that PCEs are "real codes" fits.</p>

From a technical perspective, a supplement can express explicit dependencies on the base CodeSystem content it is referencing - specifically via the version field.  A fragment doesn't really do this; it effectively exists in isolation from other fragments or a complete CodeSystem.<br>
From a conceptual perspective, if a terminology server contains two CodeSystem instances for the same code system (and version), one of which is <code>complete</code> and the other is a <code>fragment</code>, it would seem entirely reasonable for it to completely ignore the fragment as extraneous, especially if the server has in-built support for the code system.  On the other hand, a supplement is intrinsically positioned as containing information additional to the base.</p>

I can tell you that I know IGs are including code system fragments that only include the codes needed to support expansions defined in the IG, so they don't have to represent all the concepts they don't need. Make sure as you consider this you are not focused solely on SCT, LOINC. Also keep in mind that for UCUM I would presume it's always a fragment and I suspect that every server will have a different set. So we need to make what is practically happening technically correct. This sounds like a topic for a call - can we do it during a main vocab call normally 3:30p ET?

<p>Good lord. You all have made this  value set round hole the size of a truck so that every code system truck gets to drive right on in. Yes, yes I understand that no one cares about code systems and only value sets really matter. But even a trivial FHIR server should be able to provide an Expansion so that there is consistency across value set use of concepts. I hope that concept definition extension is from the pre-code system in FHIR days.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191682">@Richard Townley-O'Neill</span> Including definitions is only one reason to have code system resources available to an IG. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191343">@Michael Lawley</span> IGs may need concept information for a variety of reasons. From what I understand, <strong>very few</strong> FHIR implementations make use of a terminology service, so anything they need is inside the FHIR server. Yes, point-in-time expansions included in a FHIR value set resource (best using <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cpg/StructureDefinition-cpg-executablevalueset.html">ExecutableValueSet Profile</a> can be a very useful approach when the code system rarely changes.  But for IGs that need code systems that have complexity that various value sets use differently, we need to encourage the use of the code system resource as a central concept repository. Not demand it, but support it properly. And I'd agree that we need to make adding definitions to concepts in a code system resource easy so people don't use the absolutely easier value set extension. Having to create a supplement seems heavyweight given the "but it's fine" consideration for doing it in a value set.</p>
