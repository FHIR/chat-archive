<p>ok. I would like to add to the vocab agenda in San Antonio the need for an extension that you speicfy on binding when the binding strength is extensible, to say whether the extension is allowed to be by code, by text, or by either. </p>

<p>I get what you're asking for, but I'm not sure if it's something that we actually need (you're welcome to persuade me that it is).  Since the CodeableConcept.text is "A human language representation of the concept ...", I think that code and text go hand in hand, and I don't see a reason to make a distinction between them in regard to an extensible binding. </p>

<p>then you should read the long thread about this in the argonaut stream; they didn't want to use extensible as it is because they didn't want a different code provided in place of the recommended code, but they did need to be able to fall back to plain text</p>

<p>well. I don't know how something can have a meaning that's not in the value set if it has an is-a with a code in the value set. Alternatively, I don't understand what anyone thinks the point of an extensible value set is if it doesn't mean anything after all.</p>

<p>I think the main problem that led to this is that we're not really clear in the spec about the "can't use 'navy blue' if 'blue' is in the value set" rule for extensible bindings, except in teaching the vocabulary tutorials (which is how I teach it).  The meaning of  "can apply to the concept being communicated" and "If the value set does not cover the concept (based on human review)" just isn't clear on that, without using more specific wording or specific examples (e.g. the "blue" and "navy blue", or others) to make it clearer.  I think that's why we said in the resolution that "there is no restriction" (I don't know if I would do that again, but that's what we did).  Like it or not, saying this "rule" a lot and teaching it in tutorials doesn't really make it binding as part of the spec.  We should have actually made this clearer a long time ago.  <strong>If</strong> we can skip applying the current resolution for the moment I would be happy to re-open this and make a different decision, but for sure make it really clear in the documentation.</p>

<p>There is a situation where navy would be a valid extension, and that’s where there’s a secondary meaning in use. E.g. I assign colours to the kind of alerts that I have in the hospital, and have some special ‘navy’ alert that is different to blue alert. In that case (though it’s a bad idea), navy is not a specialisation of blue, even though by the literal meaning it is. Which is why I yanked it, because the language didn’t deal with that kind of subtlety</p>

<p>I think I agree.  But I also think we have to say clearly whether the "no subtype" rule is, in fact, required (even if we can't actually or very easily enforce it) or not.  If it's just about the represented meaning, then 'navy blue' does in fact mean something that is different than 'blue', so on that basis it would be legitimate to use.</p>

<p>"Desired meaning to be respresented is not present" is not tight enough.  If I want to send the <em>color</em> navy blue, that's not allowed unless I also send the valueset code of "blue", regardless of what I might "desire".</p>

<p>Extensible is always different from preferred (at least in theory).  It depends on how we understand and scope "apply to the concept being communicated".  If there is a code in the value set that "applies to the concept being communicated", then with an extensible binding you must use it, whereas with preferred that's not required.  But "apply to" is much less precise than what we are wanting to say the rule is.</p>

<p>I totally get that, and I more or less think of it and sometimes refer to that (and teach it) as "Lloyd's rule" (although I don't actually call it that).  But I still maintain that the specification itself <strong>doesn't actually say that</strong> - even it we think we want it to.</p>

<p>so perhaps we should add a section saying that in principle, the intention of defining an extensible value set is that implementers use one of those codes if applicble. There fore, implemeters SHOULD use one of those codes if possible. If more granularity is desired with more specific codes, these can be provided as translations. But because the exact use of code is highly variable, implementers can send a more granular code as an extensible code if desired meaning to be represented is not present and it is not safe to not include the meaning. Note that deciding which is a judgement call that may be equivocal. </p>

<p>Why would it be a SHOULD and not a SHALL?  Your 'blue'/'navy' situation doesn't actually hold.  If I'm using a code that means the color, then subsumption holds.  If I'm using a code that means threat/alert level, then subsumption wouldn't hold.  If we make it SHOULD, then people will send whatever they like and Extensible will have no meaning.  The fact that it's hard to test in an automated fashion is no reason to be soft on the rule.</p>

<p>The criteria there are pretty clear.  If your concept corresponds to the code definitions and the is-a relationships are right, the rule applies.  If the code system is broken or you're misusing the codes, then relying on code system subsumption isn't going to work, but human reasoning subsumption still will.  If humans are going to disagree then they're going to disagree.  Just as they might disagree whether something's appropriate as an Observation.category or whether it should be a translation of Observation.code.  We don't say "data placed in attributes SHOULD comply with their definitions" though.</p>

<p>A while back I came to the personal conclusion that what the spec actually said and what was most likely to be understandable by most people was that if the meaning that you are looking for is in the value set (to some reasonable degree of approximation) then you are required to use the code from the value set, but if the meaning that you are looking for isn't in the value set (subsumption isn't a consideration) then you are free to use a different code.

<p>I can accept the "no subsumed codes" rule - and I think it might actually have some real-world utility if it was understood and used consistently.  So if we want to actually keep saying and expecting that, let's add the documentation that we need in 4.1.4.2 Extensible (and anywhere else it's needed) to actually say that.  And once we've actually said that, then I think SHALL makes the most sense (if we use SHOULD then it really wouldn't be much different, if at all in practice, from preferred).</p>

But what I'm stuck with is understanding the <em>why</em> of all this -- why would you want navy blue to be excluded?  It is clearly different to blue since it says "not royal blue", where as blue does not.  So, if I'm trying to communicate that the colour is "navy blue and not royal blue (or any other blue)", then it would seem valid to say navy blue and yet this violates the no-subsumption rule.</p>

<p>The value set is 'blue' then the expectation is that any color that qualifies as blue will be represented with that code.  You can then safely build decision support and other logic on that knowledge.  If we allow people to send any code for any slightly different concept, then suddenly we have no guarantee of consistency.  If you have an ICD code that isn't <em>exactly</em> the same meaning as the SNOMED code in the extensible binding, you're suddenly free to send the ICD code instead.  Decision support doesn't work, etc.</p>

<p>One question that I have is, have we seen anyone build decision support logic that relies on this understanding of extensible being a consistent and reliable basis for implementation?  I haven't ever asked the CDS group about whether they do or would consider relying on it, but probably it would be a good question to ask.  Personally, with my past experience and present leanings I would be much more likely to rely on the SNOMED CT hierarchy to build decision support logic based on terminology - but that assumes that I have access to and am using SNOMED CT.  I wonder if anyone relies (or would rely) on this understanding with ICD or ICPC or something similar?</p>

<p>Can you clarify what is different about what you said from what is in the text (I assume you're referring to the text that I linked)?  I can't really tell where you are suggesting to have the SHALL and SHALL NOT.  The updated text that I wrote uses some different words, but so far I'm not seeing that any obvious meaning is different.  I tried where I could to use relatively easily understood terms like "more general meaning" and "more specific meaning" and minimize use of terminology-specific phrases like "is-a hierarchy", and I managed to avoid using "subsumes" entirely.  I think that should make it more rather than less clear and understandable for most of the implementer community who are the intended audience.</p>

<p>It sounds like the goal is to use the codes without relying on any subsumption. eg you want to rely on code equality in the logic and not code subsumption.<br>
I'm not sure I buy the ICD SNOMED example because that's a case where there is no code system-defined subsumption and there's only overlap of meaning, which would then threaten CDS logic.</p>

I'd rather have the following changes: <br>
1st paragraph :<br>
<em>To be conformant, codes in this element SHALL be from the specified value set if any of the codes within the value set represent, <em>or generalize</em>, the concept being communicated. If members of the value set expansion do not represent the concept (based on code system hierarchy membership, or human review), an alternate system/code from outside the value set (i.e. from a different value set or chosen from a code system directly) may be used instead.</em><br>
3rd and 4th paragraph:<br>
If there is a code in the value set expansion with a meaning which includes, but is more general than, the meaning that is desired for use, then the existing value set expansion member SHALL be used to represent the desired meaning. In this situation using a more specific code that more completely represents the intended meaning but is not included the value set expansion is <strong>not</strong> allowed. The more specific desired code may be included in the instance as an <em>additional</em> Coding if the data type is CodeableConcept, but it cannot be used instead of the code from the value set expansion. This helps ensure that systems can depend on interoperable exchange of the meanings (including more nuanced meanings) represented by codes in the extensibly bound expansion.<br>
If the code system used by the value set defines a generalization hierarchy (is-a), the code system SHALL be used to determine if the desired code can be used. Any code from the code system that is more specific (in the hierarchy) to one included in the value set expansion <strong>cannot</strong> be used. In that case the concept from the extensibly bound value set expansion that is the closest match for the intended meaning of the element instance is the one that SHALL be used in the element instance. </p>
<p>Yes, I want this to explicitly discuss how generalization hierarchies can be used. I'll look at the examples if we agree with my modifications.</p>

<p>As a (non-clinical) implementer, I find it difficult to understand why it should not be permissable to add a more specific concept to an extensible binding to a SNOMED CT-based Value Set.  I'm not sure how this would defeat interoperability, whereas I do see how using a less specific concept might.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I'm not sure that 'hiding' a concept selected by a clinician at the point of care in the additional coding element of a CodableConcept data type is going to facilitate accurate recording and subsequent presentation of that clinician's selection.</p>
<p>As an example...</p>
<p>A ValueSet contains 22298006 |Myocardial infarction| but a clinician wishes to record 57054005 |Acute myocardial infarction|<br>
It's a computationally trivial task for an analytics engine to link the (more specific) recorded concept back to the more general one found in the ValueSet</p>
<p>OTOH - if it's permissible to select a more general concept, e.g. one of its 4 parent concepts such as 57809008 |Myocardial disease|, it might not be safe for another application to map this back to a more specific concept contained in the Value Set</p>
<p>However, as ever, I'd be happy to be corrected by a professional terminologist and there's a beer waiting in Baltimore or Vancouver for anyone who can enlighten me!</p>

<p>Reasonable points there.  A comment: Probably if we're talking about an intensionally defined SNOMED CT value set all of the available pre-coordinated concepts will be included so 57054005 |Acute myocardial infarction| would be in the value set and it wouldn't be a problem to record it.  If the concept was a more specific compositional expression then that might not be "in" the value set (at least for this purpose), so that could be a different matter.  And one correction: The point of saying "the code for the concept in the value set that applies to and is the <strong>closest match</strong> for the intended meaning of the element instance is the one that should be used" (emphasis added) is that choosing a more general concept is not intended to be permissible - but maybe to make that clear enough it needs to be SHALL rather than "should".</p>

<p>The whole purpose of "extensible" is providing high confidence about how certain concepts will be represented.  If I know that pneumonia will always be represented with the same code, regardless of type, severity, onset, etc., I can dramatically simplify my software.  Interoperability is enhanced.  If implementers are allowed to send any code they like if their degree of precision differs even slightly from the standard code, interoperability goes out the window.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> - my impression, thus far, in speaking to SCT implementers in NZ is that, for a variety of reasons, they wish to present the most atomic concepts possible to clinicians without qualifiers. Most significant is the push-back if they attempt to effectively limit the vocabulary; then there is also the fact that attempting to obtain precise meaning by combining a general concept with other attributes is actually more complex, and less likely to lead to interoperable outcomes, than selecting the most specific pre-coordinated concept available in the terminology itself.</p>

<p>Because that design decision would be based on the expectation that at least some implementers would not understand how to do SNOMED subsumption and wouldn't be required to do so - either themselves or through a terminology server.

<p>It's much the same premise as what's been done with vital signs.  You SHALL send the specified LOINC code in the profile that says "blood pressure".  If you want to send a more refined one too to convey "sitting blood pressure", you can.  But you're not allowed to send that <em>instead</em>.  That means that SMART apps and others have a guaranteed reliable way to grab all blood pressures without having to worry about all the numerous ways it might potentially be coded or having to support code translations and subsuption - because asking an iPhone app to manage that is unrealistic.</p>

<p>While saying 'navy blue' with the no-subsumption rule involves sending  two codes (e.g. coding.code=Blue + coding.code=Navy Blue). This simplifies searching and machine processing. It does make display messier, showing the codes will show both 'blue' and 'navy blue'.</p>

<p>In an ideal SCT implementation world of intensional reference sets, both Rob H and Lloyd would be correct in noting that this might be an academic discussion. However, in reality National Release Centres in NZ (plus the UK and Australia from what I gather from the SNOMED on FHIR calls) are publishing extensional reference sets which, if/when bound to FHIR data elements will be problematic if they cannot be augmented by more specific concepts. As an international edition example, one just has to look for certain key antenatal concepts in the GP/Family Practice Reference Set. Without subsumption, SCT would be <em>just another coding system</em> for NZ and the business case for using it to replace Read Codes in primary care would be diminished - quite substantially.</p>

<p>I'm pushing back, as hard as I can, on the use of extensional value sets. However, for SCT, I still don't like the idea of using coded data types to repeat relationships between concepts that are already present in the properties of the selected concept itself.  Having typed that I will be prepared to change my view IF it's not shared by the implementer community I deal with on a regular basis here in NZ.</p>

<p>I don't think anyone's talking about repeating relationships.  We're talking about expressing coded data at multiple levels of granularity and possibly with different code systems.  The need for that is going to be driven by the fact that different consumers of data are frequently going to specify different value sets with granularities that are driven by the use-case.  Unless there's massive support for subsumption testing and high-quality translation across code systems (which given the terminology capabilities of most systems, seems very unlikely), sending multiple codings is going to be exceptionally common.</p>

<p>Pushing on the examples a little for full clarity, let us assume an Extensible binding to a LOINC ValueSet that includes <code>sitting blood pressure</code> but not <code>blood pressure</code>. Is it then ok to use <code>blood pressure</code> (if it's not known to be sitting)?</p>

<p>BTW I don't buy the arguments that subsumption testing is hard for any of these cases (unless you've got SNOMED post coordination in play).  The search API provides for code:below and <code>$subsumes</code> and <code>$closure</code> both allow for externalising the test.<br>
But, I think the strongest argument here is the problem of translation/mapping; knowing whether ICD10's J12.2 |Parainfluenza virus pneumonia| is valid with respect to an extensible binding with 12188008 |Parainfluenza (disorder)| is <em>hard</em></p>

<p>If the developers of endpoint systems can't handle subsumption and don't want to use terminology services, one can hardly expect them to expand intensionally-defined SCT Value Sets.

<p>because I think that's wrong. Setting a binding as extensible should dictate the users interface data collection. So you should only use it when it's a useful and important thing to do. (which is typically when you are not collecting a condition.code, for instance, and so we should stop talking about cases like that). A more useful care to talk about out is Observation.interpretationCode</p>

<p>Whether it dictates data collection will vary.  If you're complying with multiple value sets, the chances it'll influence data collection is low.  If it's the only valueset in play and systems don't typically have legacy data/existing interfaces, then adoption of the extensible value set for user interface is more likely.</p>

<p>Is "alternate concept" limited to the concept domain, or can we use a null value (unknown)?</p>

<p>Can you describe further what you're thinking of, Jay?  I will say that when we say something like "alternate code" I think we're meaning something like a code from a different code system with the same meaning as the "primary" code (allowing for granularity differences).  I don't think that a null flavor fits anywhere into that picture, but, again, maybe I don't know what you have in mind.</p>

<p>I wasn't sure whether to post this here, <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179175" href="/#narrow/stream/179175-argonaut">#argonaut</a> or <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179166" href="/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers">#implementers</a> , but I think it has more to do with the extensible binding than the content of the IG or a specific implementation.</p>
<p>I'm looking at a US Core AllergyIntolerance Resource which has an <code>AllergyIntolerance.code</code> of <code>Allergy to Peanut 91935009</code> from SNOMED.  This concept is not in the ValueSet which has an extensible binding on that element.  However that ValueSet does include the <code>Peanut (substance) 762952008</code> concept.  From what I see, <code>Allergy to Peanut 91935009</code> does not have a more general parent concept (or something higher in the is-a hierarchy) in the ValueSet that should be used instead.  This ValueSet deals with substances and not reactions to substances.</p>
<p>My instincts tell me that the right thing to do here in this context would be to use Peanut (substance), to convey the same meaning consistently, but it really is a different concept (an allergy is a different thing than a substance) when taken independent of the encapsulating resource.  Reading the spec docs on <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/terminologies.html#extensible">extensible bindings</a> and thinking about it outside the context of the AllergyIntolerance Resource makes me think this is not an applicable concept that can be substituted.</p>
<p>TL;DR: For a ValueSet with an extensible binding, does the SNOMED concept <code>Peanut (substance) 762952008</code> represent an "applicable concept" that shall be used for <code>Allergy to Peanut 91935009</code> which is not in the ValueSet?</p>
<p>Thoughts on this and how to go about evaluating situations like this?  </p>

<p>Yeah, that's a bit of a mess.  Strictly following the code system's subsumption hierarchy, the code is legal.  Following the 'intent' of the code in context, it's not.

<p>If your software is smart enough, add a coding for the SNOMED code for peanut when you store so that the instances you subsequently share are conformant, and perhaps spit back a warning.  That's the most interoperable thing you can do.  However, it's not an "easy" thing to do - extra coding and logical on your part plus ongoing terminology mapping work.  Technically, you could allow the instance in "as is" and be conformant, though less interoperable.  You could also reject the instance as non-conformant with the intent of the binding, though if it ever came to a courtroom, you'd be on shaky ground...</p>

<p>I'm looking for the right thing to do according to the spec that would be expected or enforced as I'm coming at it from a standards/conformance perspective (not a pragmatic implementation perspective).  So far it sounds like either code is applicable/allowable which is unfortunate from an interoperability perspective.  I suppose the ValueSet definition would need to explicitly exclude these alternative codes in order to prevent this while maintaining the extensible binding.</p>

<p>Lloyd just said some of what I was getting ready to say, but I'll go ahead and say it anyway.  The base AllergyIntolerance resource is explicitly intended to allow for the use of the "Allergy to x" codes (subtypes of 418038007 |Propensity to adverse reactions to substance (finding)|), as that's what some systems use to record allergies, rather than the substance codes.  The binding in the base is only example, so there is complete flexibility there.  And since the binding in the US Core profile is extensible, the "Allergy to x" codes are still allowed, even though they aren't included in the value set.  The documentation doesn't seem to say anything explicit about that, but I suspect that even though technically those codes are allowed, their use wasn't intended to be "encouraged".</p>

<p>If we wanted to do this computably, we'd need some sort of a new capability where in addition to asserting your base extensible value set you could also express a "prohibited" value set.  I.e. "use these if one applies, if none of them apply then use any code you like, but you're <em>never</em> allowed to use codes from value set X."  Not sure there'd be an appetite for that</p>

<p>Well, yes - that suggestion was essentially assuming that SNOMED will already have a code for any substance that anyone might be allergic to,  which even though mostly true is almost certainly incorrect in the end.

<p>I didn't say it was "fine".  I do expect it to happen.  Systems that actually use SNOMED internally will likely have the "allergy condition" code rather than the substance code - and their first impulse will send that code as the AllergyIntolerance.code.  From a simple subsumption perspective, the allergy condition code wouldn't be a specialization of any of the codes in the value set, so technically it would meet the expectations of 'extensible'.  Sending SNOMED codes from the wrong hierarchy isn't good practice, but it's pretty wide-spread (and in some cases necessary because there's no code from the 'appropriate' hierarchy, and sometimes not even an appropriate hierarchy).  It's certainly against the <em>spirit</em> of both the definition of the attribute and the binding, but as I said, I'd hate to be in a courtroom saying that it's definitively not allowed.</p>

<p>This may be a code for a substance or pharmaceutical product that is considered to be responsible for the adverse reaction risk (e.g., "Latex"), an allergy or intolerance condition (e.g., "Latex allergy"), or a negated/excluded code for a specific substance or class (e.g., "No latex allergy") or a general or categorical negated statement (e.g., "No known allergy", "No known drug allergies").</p>

I don't think this can be taken as a requirement though as the <code>ValueSet.description</code> "specifies the span of meanings for concepts to be included" which in this case is indicated the ValueSet only includes substance codes and not conditions.</p>
<p>Another potentially relevant clue at least.</p>

<p>Yes, I see that the base AllergyIntolerance resource does indeed allow either a substance or a finding in the code element. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197651">@Reece Adamson</span>  This kind of <em>diversity</em> in approach is a hallmark of FHIR given the requirement at the base-level to support the existing implemented melange of approaches. IMHO that means it's up to those who want <em>real</em> interoperability to define an IG that removes unhelpful variation. I think USCore has tried to do that and while technically Lloyd and Rob are correct that with an extensible binding, no Max constriction, and the base example binding including finding-type concepts; you can argue that it's fine to throw findings back into the mix. </p>
<p>I'd rather we see an implementation <strong>add</strong> a concept map that can be used to map the implied substance in the finding to the actual substance. For at least some SCT concepts the conceptual model makes that easy.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span> that makes sense and I appreciate you taking the time to help explain it to me!</p>

<p>The reason that the "Propensity to adverse reactions to substance" codes are there in the base resource is that those codes do exist in SNOMED CT and some systems actually do use them to record allergies.  I think that possibly is <strong>not</strong> being done by any systems that are operating strictly in the US, but I don't know that for certain.  I think that USCDI/ISA seems to be more specific than the US Core value set, but I also just noticed that <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/isa/representing-patient-allergies-and-intolerances-medications">ISA</a> has part of this wrong, as it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Representing Adverse Reactions/Intolerances</p>
<ul>
<li>Propensity to adverse reactions to drug (disorder) (SNOMED CT 419511003) is parent to:  <ul>
<li>Drug Allergy (disorder) (SNOMED CT 416098002) and child terms/codes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's using these "Propensity to adverse reactions" (allergy to 'x') codes for representing the "Adverse Reactions/Intolerances" - but it's misunderstanding their meaning, as, of course, they actually represent the allergy condition.</p>

<p>FWIW, any decent terminology server should be able to follow the causitive agent relationship on an "allergy finding" to find the "substance" in question. This can be done directly with <code>$lookup</code> or slightly indirectly using <code>$expand</code> and an (implicit) ValueSet defined using ECL.  No need to jump through hoops to define and build a ConceptMap.<br>
Note, you won't always end up at a specific substance -- when recording an allergy to a product, for example, it is unknown which component(s) of the product are the problematic substances.</p>

<p>doesn't that imply the thing exists</p>
