<p>Hi All</p>
<p>This is a brief note to advise that the Vocabulary WG have added a second series of fortnightly conference calls to work through the backlog of terminology-related FHIR Tracker issues. Details for the new call are here: <a href="https://www.hl7.org/concalls/CallDetails.cfm?concall=56228">https://www.hl7.org/concalls/CallDetails.cfm?concall=56228</a></p>
<p>The new series will have its first meeting on Wednesday, 9 June 2021 at 8:00PM UTC (Wednesday, 9 June 2021 at 4:00PM EST; Thursday, 10 June 2021 at 6:00AM AEST).</p>

<p>The concalls page (<a href="http://www.hl7.org/concalls/CallDetails.cfm?concall=56228">http://www.hl7.org/concalls/CallDetails.cfm?concall=56228</a>) lists the time in EST ("Wed Jun-09-2021 04:00PM EST") but daylight savings time is currently in effect for ET, so it probably should say EDT.  Also, currently 8:00 PM UTC = 4:00 PM EDT (not EST).  (Or just use "ET", which works year-round.)</p>
