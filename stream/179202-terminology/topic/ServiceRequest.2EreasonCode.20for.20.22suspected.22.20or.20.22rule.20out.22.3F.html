<p>In the <a href="https://bit.ly/argo19-messaging" target="_blank" title="https://bit.ly/argo19-messaging">Argonaut PAMA project</a>, we're using a <code>ServiceRequest</code> to convey an imaging order (e.g., cardiac MRI) and providing a <code>.reasonCode</code> to indicate the reason for the imaging study. Is it common/good practice to use a code meaning "Congenital heart disease" (rather than "Suspected congentital heart disease")  to convey a <code>reason</code>?</p>

<p>It is my opinion that expecting "suspected" or some such <em>almost</em> anywhere is very problematic.  WRT this specific need in the reason code for a test (imaging study) it should not be expected for two reasons: 1) We should discourage implementers from attempting to convey such a complex and temporally fluid nuance in a single code in a single slot, particularly this slot; 2) the combinatorial explosion problem.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> This situation is a basic aspect of what we call <em>the information model-terminology intersection</em> meaning that part of the knowledge exchanged is reflected by the model, and part is encoded within the instance terminology. What we create locks that stuff down and part of the dilemma is deciding how much is left to human interpretation of the combined model + terminology semantics. The amount of interpretation required is directly related to how tight the model is to a single interpretation. In your example <strong>if you must distinguish suspected from already confirmed</strong> conditions, then you are going to force data entry to either find model elements that differentiate among those two options (perhaps adding a condition status) or expect the terminology to carry all this information using pre or post coordination. No matter what, data entry consistency is always going to be an issue. </p>
<p>I suggest looking at this a bit differently. I think it is improper to assume that the time-sensitive nuance of confirmed, suspected, please rule this out, resolved, is there evidence of, etc., should be encoded in a test <code>reasoncode</code>. Instead that sort of information should be found elsewhere. Either in the associated condition resource, or in clinical narratives that the interested tester can retrieve and read. <code>reasonCode</code> is a small window into why the test is ordered - a very important one - but a window that does not carry all the nuance you are asking about.</p>

<p>This assessment makes sense-- but realistically we are talking about conveying a bit of information that a clinician typically provides with a single field at ordering time, if I understand correctly -- basically a pick list or a free text entry box. There is not a lot of detailed information entry happening, so it is not clear to me that it would be realistic to populate a detailed Condition resource, etc.</p>

<p>I agree with Josh on that.  What Rob M. says I think is essentially correct technically, but I'm not sure if the conclusions drawn from it are entirely warranted or practical.  The use of "reason for order" (coded or otherwise) is pretty much as Josh describes.   And we have to acknowledge Rob's comment about the intersection of the information and terminology models - and my take from that is that if you populate a "reason" element that doesn't specify the additional semantic of "suspected" (or whatever one is desired) with a code or expression that also doesn't specify that additional semantic, then what you are saying is that the reason for the order <strong>is</strong> the presence of the actual condition as would normally be understood by specifying that code.  It can't mean anything else, and if that's not your actual intended meaning then you shouldn't be trying to say it that way.  On the other hand, I think it's very common and very legitimate and likely quite necessary to be able to say that a "suspected" (or "rule out") condition is the reason for an order.  So, given what we've said, I think that gets us back to the place that we either (1) need to use single codes or expressions that convey this "suspected" or other semantic, or (2) we need specialized model elements that provide that semantic when populated with otherwise unqualified condition codes, or (3) we are then in a position where we would have to say that you can't code these kinds of reasons  at all and would have to require (somehow) that they be recorded using only free text.  If there are other viable alternatives, I must have missed them.  Of those options, I think that #1, using codes or expressions for the "suspected" conditions, may actually end up being the least bad choice in many or most cases.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span> Not sure how you disagree with my assessment then lay out the same options. But, I strongly disagree that the "least bad choice" is to create 1000's of new pre-coordinated codes for all the possible condition+status ideas that will need to be communicated. And then are you confident that everyone will <em>always</em> communicate the universally understood correct condition+status? Remember tests are used to investigate all sorts of conditions to determine all sorts of disease states and investigative states. Why force everyone to enter this level of detail? Sure if it's an available code and it currently fits, use it, but I think "the least bad choice" is to leave the code to communicate a condition that <em>could include the current disease status/state, but likely will not</em> and not push to add even more pre-coordinated status+condition codes that will <strong>not</strong> be reliably used anyway.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> I'm not saying you <em>need</em> to also reference a current condition resource, I'm just saying use it if it's there so the tester can find it to do a bit more investigating if possible.</p>

<p>The other practical note here is that these pre-coordinated codes do not really exis for most conceptst. I want to provide some guidance on using standard coding systems like SNOMED CT, and that means working with releases as they actually exist today.</p>

<p>Bottom line, I wouldn't mind explicitly updating the information model in reasonCode to also include a flag for "suspected"/provisional -- but practically speaking, just leaving the semantics blurrier per <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> is  probably more realistic.

<p>My leaning is that if you just specify a code as a reason, then it exists only in the context of the thing it's the reason for - and is somewhat fuzzy.  If you want to specifically assert a Condition (suspected or not), then that should be a separate resource instance.  And there, I'd expect non-fuzziness.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> has it right. A treatment request <em>is not where a clinician documents the status of a condition.</em> No one should be pulling a <code>reasonCode</code> off a treatment request and using that as some sort of condition statement. It exists solely within the context of the request and <em>no one</em> should use that as a document of actual patient conditions. It is a context-bound piece of hopefully helpful information.</p>

<p>My general guidance for <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> on using SNOMED CT for cases like this is that you avoid the Situation With Explicit Context (SWEC) hierarchy if at all possible; qualifiers of suspected, negation, etc really belong in the information model (ie the context provided by the Resource itself), and SWEC concepts should only be used when you absolutely have to pack all the context into a single code.</p>

<p>I think that approach <strong>may</strong> be fine, and it may very well be better - as long as we don't get a proliferation on the other side of too many specialized information model elements that are intended to do essentially the same thing, but with a specialized semantic.  It's a tradeoff, and I don't think there's necessarily a clear or absolute right and wrong.</p>

<p>HI. I basically agree with what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span>  is saying here that the workflow of ordering that is not where all the nuances of the Condition (or possible condition) can be expected to be found .. I also agree with what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>  states, there are relatively few precoordinated "suspected xx" (huge combinatorial explosion.. If more the detail information is needed then ConditionResource with the correct verificationStatus would be conveyed. I like the idea that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> states for investigationOf in the model ... EHRs probably capture that in various ways during the ordering process... (This is like a "Planned Procedure" with a Contained RSON "Indication"  template in C-CDA :-)</p>

<p>Agreed -- naming aside, would be nice to have the "suspected" semantics represented in the equivalent of an <code>investigationOf[CodeableConcept]</code> element.</p>

<p>I'm unconvinced that we need "investigationOf" or any such detail. As a clinician I'm absolutely in support of including what condition is triggering the request, but details of if it's confirming, following the progress of, assessing stage of therapy, or any other aspect is something that is very rarely something that is easily conveyed in a single phrase. It is also rarely I believe, of importance to the test-doer. When it is, something more expansive should be provided - a condition resource, a text note, a call! If the test-doer is independently interested in the patient's condition - <strong>look at the record</strong> - that is what we have done, is it so different in FHIRlandia? I'm particularly concerned about what the name of this special context element would be because I see this causing all sorts of confusion - telephone game-like. Where do I put what ever gets chosen to represent hip replacement (or osteoarthritis) when ordering a bleeding time if I'm using heparin to anticoagulant during the  post-surgical period? How about PSA level after prostate surgery - is that investigating recurrence or confirming status?? I'm strongly suggesting you are not in the 80% here!</p>

<p>changing element names is big deal and breaks everthing,  I don't think this discussion has convinced me that its worth it,   clarify in the definiitions,  add aliases but leave the element names stable.</p>
