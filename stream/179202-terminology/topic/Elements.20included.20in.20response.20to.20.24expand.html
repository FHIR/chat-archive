<p>I was playing around with the VS <code>$expand</code> on the LOINC terminology server (<a href="https://fhir.loinc.org/">https://fhir.loinc.org/</a>) and looking at the differences between the returned result and the unexpanded VS itself (from the same server). While it obviously makes sense that <code>id</code> and <code>meta</code> fields are missing in the expansion response, I was surprised that they did not include the <code>url</code>, <code>identifier</code>, and <code>version</code> elements from the VS itself.  I would have thought they would be considered important for documenting <em>what</em> has been expanded. Are there general guidelines/requirements for which ValueSet element are included in the the response to <code>$expand</code>, beyond what the resource itself requires?</p>

<p>I would normally expect the <code>url</code> and <code>version</code> and probably <code>name</code> and <code>title</code> (but not <code>identifier</code>; the <code>url</code> is the public identity of a ValueSet).  But, I'm not sure that there are any rules beyond minimum cardinalities.<br>
However, if there are things that, as a client, you really want, then you can express that in the <code>_elements</code> parameter.</p>
