<p>I don't think it's helpful to re-use <a href="http://snomed.info/sct" target="_blank" title="http://snomed.info/sct">http://snomed.info/sct</a> for these codes.  They are deprecated by SNOMED International and are not SCTIDs or UUIDs (the only valid component identifiers).  I think it would be more useful to define  <a href="http://snomed.info/srt" target="_blank" title="http://snomed.info/srt">http://snomed.info/srt</a> for these and include 900000000000498005 as one of the implicit concept maps</p>

<p>I'm kind of torn on this to be honest.  I think this <a href="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCCMG/4.6.2+Migration+from+SNOMED+International" target="_blank" title="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCCMG/4.6.2+Migration+from+SNOMED+International">https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCCMG/4.6.2+Migration+from+SNOMED+International</a> is saying that they're still valid concept ids and that they are enumerated in the 900000000000498005 map refset.  But it then raises the issue of what their location in the hierarchy is, what their display and designations are, etc etc</p>

<p>But...it <em>is</em> called something different (both SNOMED International and SNOMED RT) as distinct from SNOMED CT</p>

<p>And this language from the SNOMED Change Management Guide also suggests they are distinct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This section contains specific advice related to migration to SNOMED CT from previous SNOMED CT code systems including SNOMED RT and SNOMED International.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So both pragmatically and justifiably I believe a formally separate code system is reasonable.</p>

<p>well, from my point of view, the most useful part of differentiating them is that I don't think that people area aware that a value set that includes <a href="http://snomed.info/sct" target="_blank" title="http://snomed.info/sct">http://snomed.info/sct</a> includes the RT codes as well (even though we do specifically say that)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193145">@David Clunie</span> I'm not really sure that's true.  It depends what you mean by "concept".  Certainly the map is a statement of (I believe) equivalence, but I'm fairly convinced that the codes belong to different code systems.</p>

<p>All of the SNOMED CT concepts used in DICOM do have old-style RT codes (there is absolutely no question that they are the same "concepts") and for the time being we (DICOM) haven't figured out how to switch to the new style codes without invalidating without invalidating the installed base of DICOM devices that depend on them, regardless of SNOMED policy. That does not mean, of course, that FHIR implementations have to do the same ... the value sets could include the SCT mappings too (or instead).</p>

<p>well, it is an interesting question whether the imaging type FHIR resources should contain concept ids or RT codes. But it's principally a NEMA question, I think. Resources should be able to contain RT style codes irrespectively, and the terminology infrastructure should be able to cope.</p>

<p>I want to point out that these legacy SNOMED identifiers were not introduced in or specifically dependent on SNOMED RT, so I don't think that <a href="http://snomed.info/srt" target="_blank" title="http://snomed.info/srt">http://snomed.info/srt</a> really makes sense to use as the url for them.  The legacy identifiers were originally from SNOMED International, prior to the introduction of SNOMED RT (the SCTID was introduced in RT), but they also continued to be generated and were included in both SNOMED RT and CT (until RF2 was introduced).   I'm not sure what the best url for them is, but maybe it could be something like <a href="http://snomed.info/snm" target="_blank" title="http://snomed.info/snm">http://snomed.info/snm</a>.</p>

<p>The 900000000000498005 refset no longer ships as part of current international RF2 data releases. It used to, until the Jan 2017 release, but is now withdrawn entirely as part of SI trying to drive through the withdrawal of the antecedent versions. So, if you have a SNOMED RT identifier from historical data and you now want to work out what the equivalent SNOMED CT identifier is, this operation has now already become an extremely complex piece of archeology: even with the last published version of that refset (from within der2_sRefset_SimpleMapSnapshot_INT_20170131.txt) , you'll find that 106,341 of the 432,470 SNOMED RT IDs listed therein (24.6%) were last seen attached to a SNOMED CT conceptId that has already become inactive in today's SNOMED CT, meaning that your ability to taxonomically report on these direct 'mapped' SNOMED CT equiv codes is in fact seriously compromised, unless and until you also unravel the historical SAME_AS relationships etc etc.</p>

<p>[The particular code at the start of this thread - R-40819 - wasn't even ever a SNOMED RT identifier, there having never been a single code that was part of SNOMED RT (or SNOMED II, 3 or 3.5) beginning with an 'R-' character sequence.]</p>

<p>There IS an entry in the old Jan 2017 release of the 900000000000498005 srefset, asserting that 'R-40819' has some kind of correspondence with 260521003|Internal (qualifier value)|. 87,927 other rows in that same srefset also claim to state a map or code equivalence between an 'R' series SNOMED ID and some modern day SNOMED CT conceptId. But none of those R-series SNOMEDIDs appear in the final release of SNOMED RT itself that Kent Spackman gave me way back (there having never been a Chapter R, as I said...) and so they don't validate as bona fide SNOMED RT codes depending on what SNOMED RT reference you have. I note that many of them were only added very recently - long after SNOMED RT development stopped - and so I suspect they are actually ALL fake SNOMED RT identfiers that SI were in the habit of adding in order that the SNOMEDID slot in the old RF1 tables still contained a string and not a null, even though the strings being inserted were never officially SNOMED RT codes at all. Similar to all the CTV3 codes beginning XU furnished by another refset shipped as part of the same release file, none of which are legit CTV3 codes despite what the relevant refset is called.</p>

<p>I would expect SI to politely decline to support a <a href="http://snomed.info/srt" target="_blank" title="http://snomed.info/srt">http://snomed.info/srt</a> URI, since this isn't compatible with their signalling almost a decade ago that could no longer support the antecedent terminologies on grounds of clinical safety. But assuming they agreed, you would then expect it to only recognise/validate the official final set of SNOMED RT identifiers, and not also the &gt;300k pseudo-SRT identifiers - such as all those beginning with an R - that you can find populating the SNOMEDID column of Ye Olde RF1 sct1_concepts distro, or listed in the now withdrawn 900000000000498005 srefset that was, in truth, never a 'map' despite its name. </p>
<p>The full set of 432k SNOMEDID identifiers previously listed within 900000000000498005, which have now bled over into specifications like DICOM, are clearly not exclusively IDs derived properly from SNOMED RT. Only 127,294 of them are true equivalence/mapping references to identifiers that actually do belong primarily to that external antecedent terminology (which only ever contained 132,517 different concepts) and within which those external codes also originally had a different extensional definition (parents, children, siblings in the SRT taxonomy). The huge majority of them - 305,176 - are actually true, simple, alternate concept identifiers within SNOMED CT itself and that never had any other meaning in any other scheme. </p>
<p>Given this split, what identifiers would you expect to validate against &lt;system value="http://snomed.info/srt"/&gt; ?</p>

<p>Yes, Jeremy's points are well taken.  I agree that SI <strong>should</strong> provide some means of supporting legacy data, and hopefully they will.  I think that namespaces and urls could be created for the relevant sets and versions.  That would be mostly legacy SNOMED II/Int., I think.  I don't think that SNOMED RT itself was ever used much, but some of it's legacy ids and the other new "legacy" ids created in SNOMED CT possibly could be in use.  The UK and NZ can worry about the  Read codes and CTV3.  :)</p>

<p>and DICOM which used SRT codes for ever, including the R- codes with the problems. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193145">@David Clunie</span> might want to comment</p>

<p>The legacy IDs are definitely in use in the installed base of DICOM devices. There are estimated to be tens or hundreds of billions of DICOM images in archives globally, for what that is worth (though not all include SNOMED codes). E.g., every mammogram in the world includes at least T-04000 Breast, as well as view codes, etc. (R-10226 medio-lateral oblique). So for FHIR ImagingStudy ...</p>

<p>My understanding of the SNOMED position is that the codes in image archives are perfectly fine (i.e., it is a valid, non-licence-breaching use), but the creation of new images with these codes is the problem. Certainly this would be true for new devices, which would be subject to the newer licence conditions. I have no knowledge of the licence conditions for older devices and whether they allowed the terms to be varied in the future (ie now, or even as far back as 2009 when the retirement plan was first announced)</p>
