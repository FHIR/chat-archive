<p>Unless I've overlooked it, it seems that we've only barely touched on the question of whether you can use a designation from a code system supplement in a resource instance in Coding.display.  I can't find anything documented in the spec that specifically addresses it, and searching back in Zulip this is all that I found (from 2018-03-20):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Michael Lawley: 1. Can a supplement specify and alternative display value for a concept?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Can it specify an alternative use code for a designation?</li>
</ol>
<p>Grahame Grieve: #1 it can add designations. We haven't described any way in which it could replace the display defined by the code system, but we also haven't said that a code system supplement can't define a designation that is the most appropriate to use in a given context.</p>
<p>#2. no. but it can define a new designation with the same value and a new use code</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this from 2018-11-16:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Xiaocheng Luan: Hi everyone, I work in Paul's team, new to FHIR. Guess my main confusion is what exactly a supplement is. I could imagine two extreme views:<br>
(1) A supplement is a "patch" to the code system it references, it's not a code system by itself (and thus can't be used in a Coding). A supplement-aware terminology server considers it to be part of the code system it "supplements".<br>
(2) A supplement is a code system of its own right, it "inherits" the definitions from the code system it references and adds extra, much like a subclass in the context of object oriented modeling. It thus has its own code system URL (e.g., loinc.org-ext1) and can be used in "Coding".</p>
<p>For the "patch" view in (1), there could be issues of local vs. global/standard, and consistency issues across terminology servers on specific code systems (with/without different supplements defined).<br>
For the "subclass" view, it may obligate terminology servers hosting such "supplement/subclass" code systems to be fully aware of/support the filters, properties, etc., defined in the original (parent) code system?<br>
This "subclass" view was what I thought it should roughly be but it does not appear to be the case based on the conversations in this thread?</p>
<p>Lloyd McKenzie: A code system supplement is absolutely constrained to be #1. It cannot define new codes, nor can it define new meanings for codes. However, it can define new properties, new display values and/or new relationships for codes defined in another code system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lloyd's take on it isn't particularly detailed but it sounds at least somewhat more permissive.  So is the consensus still that an additional designation that is specified in a code system supplement <strong>cannot</strong> be used to populate an instance of Coding.display, or is this something that we do (or want to) allow?</p>

<p>It's certainly something we <em>need</em> to allow.  However, it may be that the value set will need to acknowledge the supplements that are in scope for the use of that value set.  (We can't expect a validator to check for displays defined in supplements it doesn't know anything about...)</p>

<p>Yes, we will need to consider that.  If the supplement is included in an IG (package), would it also need to be declared in the value set definition(s)?  Probably so, but we should look at all of the possible options.</p>

<p>If it's just any supplement that happens to be available in the hierarchy of dependencies or in the local guide, that makes things easier for the specifier, but somewhat harder for the tool.  It also creates some challenges with using terminology services - as you'd need the terminology service to be aware of the supplements.  Would also need to consider whether it's allowed to point to a supplement that <em>isn't</em> part of the hierarchy of dependencies or local guide, or whether you must always have a dependency.</p>

<p>we certainly do not want value sets to have to explicitly declare language packs. But we've pretty much agreed here before that they need to declare supplements if they use them in filters</p>

<p>I think we did agree on that.  But I'm not sure at that point how thoroughly we had considered all of the possible use cases.  I'm not saying for sure that I think we could or should do something different - just that we may not have explored all of the possible scenarios fully.  I'm thinking particularly in the IPS context with the use of and desire to communicate multiple languages.  I think it does work with the current Coding.display rules - but the Immunization example that we had in the IPS spec wasn't following that, and that's what I'm cleaning up now.</p>

<p>so that means that you can't publish a supplement with a URL like <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/3166-supplement">http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/3166-supplement</a>, because you aren't <a href="http://hl7.org">hl7.org</a> (though you could ask us to do that).

<p>P.S.: i missunderstood: "The CodeSystem.url for a supplement SHALL never appear in a Coding.system" which means i still code with the original CS URI, and never insert the supplement CS URI, which has to be a different URI.</p>

<p>I think you need to change the binding to a binding that invokes the supplement</p>

<p>You're allowed to change even required bindings - you just can't increase the set of codes available.</p>

<p>Yes, if you change the binding to an equivalent ValueSet (eg by including the original) that also references the supplement, then $validate should take into account the german displays.</p>
