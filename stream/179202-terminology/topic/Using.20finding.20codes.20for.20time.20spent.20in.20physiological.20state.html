<p>(This is the continuation of <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Capturing.20time.20spent.20in.20a.20particular.20state.2Fcondition">this thread from implementers</a> that Lloyd suggested I take here)</p>
<p>I am looking at encoding measurements from wearable devices in Observations - specifically, data about when (or for how long) a user had poor posture (as detected by the device). There is, understandably, no LOINC code for "time spent in poor posture". However, there <em>are</em> SNOMED finding codes for poor posture. I imagine this is not an unusual situation, especially with wearables: I want to capture "period/total tim spent in state X" where X is some physiological state (in poor posture, low blood sugar, asleep etc.) for which there is a SNOMED finding code for X. One could of course define custom codes, but it seems desirable to leverage the fact that we already have a clean well-known code for X. So my question is: Is it possible to "post-coordinate" a SNOMED finding code for X in an Observation resource to communicate </p>
<ol>
<li>"total time spent in state X" and</li>
<li>"period spent in state X"??</li>
</ol>
<p>E.g one could image setting <code>Observation.code</code> to the SNOMED finding code and then, for case (1) using <code>Observation.valueQuantity</code> to communicate the amount of time in this state, or, for (2) to use <code>Observation.valuePeriod</code> to communicate the period in this state (with <code>Observation.effectivePeriod</code> given the total observation time/reference time). Lloyd indicated that there are mechanisms to combine observation codes and <code>components</code> to communicate such things - I would be very interested in hearing about that.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194703">@Morten Ernebjerg</span> Lloyd had originally suggested creating a custom code for use in Observation.  I think that would be a reasonable way to do it.  But I think what you are hoping or asking for is more about how you can use existing codes in some type of "pattern" within the Observation resource.  I hate to have you move the discussion again, but I think it would better to have that discussion in the <a href="#narrow/stream/179256-Orders-and.20Observation.20WG">Orders and Observation WG</a> stream rather than here.</p>

<p>Yes, there's a handful of "Duration of X" concepts in the SNOMED Observable entity hierarchy, but sadly no underlying modelling pattern that could be adopted to do some kind of (SNOMED) post coordination approach.  Foe example, <code>Duration of seizure</code> has no relationships to a general concept of <code>Duration</code> nor even to <code>Seizure</code>.</p>
