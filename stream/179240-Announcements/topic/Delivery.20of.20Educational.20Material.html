<p>One strong theme at HIMSS this week- both ni the floor, and at the interop demo - was delivery of educational material in context - either for the patient, or the clinical practitioner. I had several companies looking to migrate from old media to inline delivery using FHIR/cds-hooks. Enough to make me think that we should assemble a special interest group, and/or a connectation track. If you're interested in being part of that, drop me a line privately. thanks.</p>
