HL7 is offering a free guided tour of HL7 standards for students called “Starting from Scratch: A Recipe for Students Using HL7 Standards Including HL7 FHIR.” The event will be held on Wednesday, September 18 from 1:45 to 3:00 PM during the HL7 33rd Annual Plenary and Working Group Meeting (WGM). This is an opportunity for students to learn about HL7, its legacy standards and FHIR. A major focus of this presentation will be an overview of our most recent standard FHIR and how a knowledge of HL7 standards will give these students a competitive edge in the job market. Registration is required, and students can register for this free tutorial at: <a href="https://lnkd.in/eMikQVy" target="_blank" title="https://lnkd.in/eMikQVy">https://lnkd.in/eMikQVy</a>. Please forward to students in the Atlanta area. Thanks.</p>
