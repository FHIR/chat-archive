<p>I'm keenly aware that I'm using Announcements for something that could be specific to the Patient Empowerment stream, but I'm doing it (just once) because an unexpected authoritative source has posted an extraordinary editorial. At DevDays I will be chatting up the whole subject of patient access to data and patient apps. The attached editorial in the esteemed <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> was quite a surprise - to a large extent they ARE the establishment. </p>

I can personally attest to the importance of this - patients today may have far more data points than the professionals do. They're not equivalent, but they need to be integrated. <strong>Only FHIR apps can enable this.</strong></p>
<p>Highlights were added by  cardiologist @EricTopol in his Twitter stream. (In other words, I believe the long-awaited era of <strong>legitimate</strong> patient-driven apps is arriving.)</p>
