<p>Our 30th HL7 FHIR Connectathon will take place May 3-4, 2022. This event will be virtual in Eastern time.</p>
<p>We will be accepting Track Proposals on the Connectathon 30 Confluence Page until March 1st. </p>
<ol>
<li>Use the template at the bottom of the page by clicking the “Propose a Track” button. Don’t copy your old page, don’t delete sections; we all like standards! 😊</li>
<li>You can enter your session schedule by clicking the “Schedule a Session in Whova” link under Quick Links. We will be uploading these sessions to Whova starting March 15th so please think through these now. Entering changes later is possible but it is a manual process so we appreciate your help finalizing this over the next month.</li>
<li>Attend the track lead kick off call on March 1 at 4:00 PM. These are scheduled as a touchpoint every other Tuesday to help ensure you have what you need for a great Connectathon.</li>
</ol>
