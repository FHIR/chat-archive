<p>If you are working on FHIR® and have an app to show, we would like to hear from you! Consider submitting by AUGUST 2 to the competition, which is a fun, fast-paced kaleidoscope of practical and innovative FHIR® apps. We are interested in health-related FHIR® apps that: <br>
•   are deployed in a real-world setting, and in use with clinicians, caregivers, patients or people;<br>
•   address a real-world need or problem in an innovative, efficient and effective way; and<br>
•   provide clinical value. If you have one or more evaluation studies, so much the better!<br>
