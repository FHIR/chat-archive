<p>The FMG  is seeking feedback on updates to the QA criteria for resources and a new set of QA criteria for all other types of FHIR artifacts (profiles, value sets, IGs, etc.).  These criteria will form the basis for achieving FMM 3 and higher.  They'll apply to all HL7 artifacts as well as artifacts produced by other organizations who choose to adhere to HL7's FMM framework.</p>
<p>The proposed criteria can be found here: <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Conformance_QA_Criteria" target="_blank" title="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Conformance_QA_Criteria">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Conformance_QA_Criteria</a></p>
<p>We're interested in feedback from two groups: Implementers and HL7 committers &amp; content creators</p>
<p>We're interested in all feedback, but we're particularly interested in the following:<br>
- Are these criteria complete?  Are there others we need?<br>
- Are these criteria useful?  Are there any of these we shouldn't be wasting our time on?<br>
- Are these criteria reasonable?  If you're going to be creating your own IGs and associated resources, would you be comfortable adhering to these criteria?</p>
<p>The FMG is asking that all feedback be provided by July 12.  Feedback may be submitted by emailing <a href="mailto:fmgcontact@hl7.org" title="mailto:fmgcontact@hl7.org">fmgcontact@hl7.org</a></p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact me or any other member of the FHIR management group.</p>
