<p>Anyone interested (or know of anyone who is interested) in the exchange of detailed dental information using FHIR, a new FHIR Dental IG is being launched in collaboration with the ADA (American Dental Association).  </p>
<p>Any interested should join the discussion @ <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179292" href="/#narrow/stream/179292-dental">#dental</a> ... we are looking to understand the scenarios of value to all stakeholders - so input from everyone is welcomed!  Also, though this work will be joint with HL7 and the ADA, the intent is to have it international and not constrained to the U.S. Realm.</p>
<p>In the immortal words of Dr. Ed, "After all, everyone has teeth ... !" </p>
<p>Contact <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192176">@Todd Cooper</span>  if you have any questions or want to chat this week here in Baltimore.</p>
