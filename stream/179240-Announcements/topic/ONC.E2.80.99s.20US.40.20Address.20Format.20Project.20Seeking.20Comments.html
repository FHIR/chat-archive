<p>HL7 representatives, along with NCPDP and X12, AHIMA and postal service representatives have been involved in an ONC initiative to develop an informative guide for standardization around address format.<br>
The intent is that HL7 and other standards organization will leverage this work when refining address elements and attributes in the standards such that patient matching will be improved.</p>
<p>The draft document is completed and each standards organization is seeking comments for ONC outside their normal ballot or commenting processes.<br>
The comment period is open July 1, 2021 (today) through July 31st.</p>
<p>More information, instructions  and a downloadable spreadsheet template for commenting  can be found here: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=113673891">https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=113673891</a></p>
