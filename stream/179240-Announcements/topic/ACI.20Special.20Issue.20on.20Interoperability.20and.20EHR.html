<p>Dear FHIR community,</p>
<p>I'd like to give a heads up to the call for papers to the special issue on Interoperability and EHR in Applied Clinical Informatics. Prof. Kerstin Denecke from Bern University of Applied Sciences and I are guest editors and the aim of this special issue is to have informed and balanced papers on the theory and practice of standards to achieve interoperability and to develop EHR systems (that are intraoperable with Grahame's token). Deadline is 15 January, 2017.</p>
<p>Link to call for papers (pdf): <a href="https://aci.schattauer.de/fileadmin/assets/zeitschriften/ACI/CFP_ACI_Interoperability.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://aci.schattauer.de/fileadmin/assets/zeitschriften/ACI/CFP_ACI_Interoperability.pdf">https://aci.schattauer.de/fileadmin/assets/zeitschriften/ACI/CFP_ACI_Interoperability.pdf</a></p>
<p>Summary: The recent focus on HL7’s emerging Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) has directed attention on the fact that attempts to achieve interoperability have been only partly successful in the past despite a host of existing terminologies (for example SNOMED CT, ICD and LOINC) and standards for health information exchange and EHR (HL7 v2,v3/CDA, openEHR/13606, IHE, DICOM etc.). This special topic feature of Applied Clinical Informatics will focus on applied, practical approaches of achieving and maintaining interoperability among disparate systems, including EHRs. We are soliciting submissions that focus on best practice approaches, lesson learned or evaluation of interoperability and EHR systems development or identify causes of failures.</p>
