<p>I apologize for the inconvenience, but we detected our ListServ is having issues keeping up with volume of mail and is currently working through a significant amount of mailings.  We are working on the issue.   You may have received a duplicate ListServ communication from one of the lists you are a member.    We hope to resolve the issue soon and the back log of emails will go out within 24hrs.   Thank you for your patience.  <a href="mailto:Eric@Hl7.org">Eric@Hl7.org</a></p>

<p>The HL7 ListServ system is back to functioning properly.  I apologize if you received duplicate emails from the system.  This issue is now resolved.  <br>
