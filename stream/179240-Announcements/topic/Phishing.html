<p>In the last couple of days I have personally received, and also had reports of, reports of phishing and/or scamming that were extremely tailored to HL7 and FHIR communiy and leadership by name. </p>
<p>Please check origins, technical email addresses, and if you get asked to do anything - particularly spend money on anything - check that it's real on a different channel </p>
<p>Note: There's nothing new in the techniques used. I've not seen any evidence that our actual email accounts etc have been compromised; it's all used publicly available information</p>
