<p>FMG is considering an interim release of FHIR R4, that introduces limited changes to R4, since it appears that the R5 timeline is slipping (due to the virus and other reasons, maybe early 2022?). The intent is that it will be published by start of Q2 2021, and that all implementers will be able to update their implementation to the new version simply by changing the version they claim to implement, except for some clearly defined areas where change is to be made - that is, introducing the new subscription framework, and updating the Medication Definition resources (MedicinalProductDefinition etc) and probably EBM resources (Evidence etc). </p>
<p>This raises several questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>is this a good idea? Please discuss here: <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/R4A.20Release">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/R4A.20Release</a></li>
<li>how would versioning work? - whatever we do will break our existing infrastructure. Discussion on this from tool smiths etc at <a href="#narrow/stream/179239-tooling/topic/Approach.204A.20Versioning.20Policy">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179239-tooling/topic/Approach.204A.20Versioning.20Policy</a></li>
<li>what would the committers editorial policy be? discussion here: <a href="#narrow/stream/179165-committers/topic/R4A.20Editorial.20Process">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179165-committers/topic/R4A.20Editorial.20Process</a></li>
</ul>
