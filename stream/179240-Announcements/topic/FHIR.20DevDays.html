<p>I'd like to wish everyone safe travels as they head to Boston.  I'm staying back and look forward to hearing about the event through some Zulip channels.  Please keep the updates coming!</p>

<p>FHIR DevDays Amsterdam: Call for Presentations</p>
<p>We are now preparing for HL7 FHIR DevDays Amsterdam 2018 (the fifth edition), running from 14 to 16 November. When we started DevDays we knew where and how FHIR was being applied. That is no longer the case. We're amazed by the projects that are going on. That is why we decided to reserve a limited number of 40 minute slots in the schedule for tutorials initiated by you, the FHIR community. </p>
<p>If you have a topic that has learning value for the attendees, send me a direct message. Only tutorial-like presentations will qualify. If you have hands-on material to bring along, like a sandbox, exercises, documentation, that's certainly a plus. Please send me the title, summary and target audience of your tutorial. </p>
<p>As a speaker you get free access to the event. </p>
<p>Registration for DevDays Amsterdam is now open, by the way (<a href="https://bit.ly/2JfZSXU" target="_blank" title="https://bit.ly/2JfZSXU">https://bit.ly/2JfZSXU</a>). FHIR DevDays Boston sold out, just so you know.</p>
