<p>Subsequent to the actual connectathon (i.e. Sunday PM) the "Application Implementation and Design (AID)" HL7 User Group will meet to discuss FHIR implementation approaches and design patterns. You're invited to share your 'lessons learned' with others in the FHIR implementation community, or to listen to other FHIR implementers.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=AID_201605_Meeting_in_Montreal" target="_blank" title="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=AID_201605_Meeting_in_Montreal">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=AID_201605_Meeting_in_Montreal</a>  for details.</p>
<p>I'd like to expecially invite the track leaders at the connectathon to join AID to inform the user community about the lessons learned (with respect to your track) during the connectathon.</p>
<p>Please contact me to get hold of a slot on the AID agenda - we do appreciate you sharing your ideas and experiences.</p>
<p>Your presentation will be video recorded, to inform the wider community of your experiences. See <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/hl7aid" target="_blank" title="https://vimeo.com/channels/hl7aid">https://vimeo.com/channels/hl7aid</a> for videos of earlier presentations.</p>
