<p>A few people in the HL7 community have received emails that contain content extracted from various HL7 list server discussions and which claim to come from HL7 members (but whose return addresses are incorrect) with attached XLS spreadsheets.  Please use extra caution when you receive emails with Excel attachments, double-check the sender, and if at all suspicious, don't open and verify with the sender by some mechanism other than a reply email.  (Discussion, if any, on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179160" href="/#narrow/stream/179160-social">#social</a> please.)</p>
