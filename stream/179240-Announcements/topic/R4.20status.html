<p>FHIR R4 is pretty much complete. <a href="http://build.fhir.org" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org">http://build.fhir.org</a> is fully R4 at v4.0.0 now, waiting for me to plug the actual publication date in, and publish it to <a href="http://h7.org/fhir" target="_blank" title="http://h7.org/fhir">http://h7.org/fhir</a>. My thanks to all in the community, but particularly co-chairs and editors/committers - preparing R4 has been a massive project</p>
<p>R4 isn't actually published yet - we're waiting for a recirculation ballot so that the community that balloted on the Patient ballot in May can confirm that we are ignoring a negative ballot that hasn't been withdrawn.</p>
<ul>
<li>the negative ballot was made in support of another balloter's line item</li>
<li>the line item was resolved, and the balloter withdrew the negative</li>
<li>the voter for the supporting negative vote has left the company and can no longer be contacted</li>
<li>this has never happened before, so we have no process to overlook such a ballot</li>
<li>the only way we can resolve this is to ask the ballot pool from May to confirm that they are comfortable with the non-withdrawn negative - this is known in HL7 arcane language as 'a recirculation ballot'</li>
<li>this closes Dec 25th. Assuming that the ballot pool confirms that it's ok to ignore this ballot, we can publish R4 after that</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're a member of that ballot pool, please don't look at it, think how stupid it is, and decide not to vote. We'll be changing our processes for the future, but we have to do this now. Please vote to affirm our decisions so that we can publish R4 rather than being stuck in limbo.</p>

<p>Actually, the reaffirmation process doesn't quite work like that.  Reaffirmation is a chance to <em>change</em> your vote from the last Patient vote (2018Sep).  If you voted affirmative that time (or you voted negative and subsequently withdrew) and you do nothing, your vote will be treated as an affirmative.  If you were part of the ballot pool but abstained or didn't vote, you can change your vote during the recirculation period.  If lots of people change their votes from affirmative to negative based on the non-withdrawn vote, the ballot could fail to pass (which would suck).  However that scenario is unlikely.  That said, if you really want to the ballot to pass and you didn't vote affirmative last time, you can choose to change your vote to affirmative to make the scenario even less likely.</p>
