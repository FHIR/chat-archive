<strong>BOOKING</strong>: <a href="https://digitalhealthrewired.com/digital-health-rewired-developer-conference/" target="_blank" title="https://digitalhealthrewired.com/digital-health-rewired-developer-conference/">https://digitalhealthrewired.com/digital-health-rewired-developer-conference/</a><br>
<strong>INFO</strong><br>
I think this might be the first EVER UK Health Developer Conference! (I’m prepared for people to tell me otherwise though).</p>
<p>Please share widely - I’m hoping we can make this into a useful annual event, that really helps people to get over the initial ‘hump of difficulty’ of learning new health/care-related technology, and demonstrates what’s out there in terms of ideas, frameworks, standards, and approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Who should come?</strong><br>
Developers, sysadmins, technical architects, software engineers of all levels and seniorities, working for NHS Trusts, startups, NHS Digital, NHSX, third sector organisations across health and care, and existing healthcare system suppliers.<br>
