<p>This a public message to the FHIR community from a first time Zulip user</p>
<p><strong>This posting was prepared with and previewed using the wonderful <a href="http://markdownlivepreview.com/" target="_blank" title="http://markdownlivepreview.com/">Markdown Live Preview</a> online service.</strong></p>
<p>_And as a first time Zulip user today I can assure you that without a decent previewer of the markdown in posts I would not feel like spending a second more of my time trying to contribute to the FHIR effort via the Zulip channel. I would find another avenue: GitHub, Drupal CMS, JIRA, anything but Zulip. Because otherwise it wastes my time._</p>
<p>Dear FHIR people, </p>
<p>Although this is unrelated to health (except perhaps my mental health if I have to keep using Zulip without a markdown previewer) either: </p>
<p>1) Put me out of my misery and show me where Zulip has a <strong>Preview</strong> button for markdown posts (like every other decent markdown client since the stone ages).</p>
<p>2) Use whatever influence you do have on Zulip development and make it clear that if that feature is not implemented fewer people will want to contribute to FHIR through this channel. Because without a decent previewer, it's too hard to communicate software engineering easily.</p>
<p>BTW: The result I got with my very first Zulip posting using the <a href="http://markdownlivepreview.com/" target="_blank" title="http://markdownlivepreview.com/">Markdown Live Preview</a> online service looks different than when I submitted it to Zulip's FHIR channel (which form during editing I could not preview properly either because I am too stupid or the feature does not exist).</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: I had to edit this post because it did not look the same again, I am trying to guess what it will look like after posting</strong></p>
<p>Constructively,</p>
<p>Darren Kelly, Webel IT Australia</p>

<p>This is suitable for the social stream, or alternatively on a zulip support channel. Please do not use announcements for this use. </p>
