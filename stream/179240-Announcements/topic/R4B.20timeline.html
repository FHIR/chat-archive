<p>The time-frame for balloting of R4B had originally been slated to be at the same time the January ballot opened for everything else - i.e. Dec. 18th.<br>
However, Grahame has been caught up in IG Publisher maintenance and hasn't had the bandwidth to make the changes to the Core Publisher needed to allow R4B to proceed.  We don't yet have a specific timeframe set, but it likely won't be until early January.  The latest we can do it and still be part of the January cycle is Jan. 14th.  The FMG will provide updates on the timeline as soon as we have any.<br>
In the meantime, please do your best to have content ready for ballot so that once the tooling is ready, we can proceed to ballot expeditiously.</p>

<p>An update from the FMG on R4B.  The amount of work to be done to get R4B to be ready to publish seems unlikely to happen by Jan. 14th, which is the latest publication can reasonably happen as part of the January ballot cycle.  Therefore, the FMG will be seeking TSC approval to put R4B out on the earliest possible date as part of the May cycle.  Presuming approval is granted, R4B should open about Feb. 18 (with sign-up beginning Jan. 19th).  Our apologies for this delay.  Unfortunately, the volume of development and maintenance work on the IG Publisher and terminology systems turned out to be significantly higher than anticipated.  Work groups participating in R4B should have their content ready for migration and subsequent QA testing around the end of January.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Good news and bad news.  The good news is that, thanks to significant efforts by the work groups, the desired changes and most planned technical corrections have been applied and are ready for ballot.  However, some challenges with the tooling environment have kept us from getting to the appropriate quality level to be able to publish on Friday Mar. 5th as planned.  We are confident that these issues can be addressed in a relatively short timeframe and the FHIR Management Group is now scheduled to sign off on the content on Wednesday, March 10, with a planned ballot open date of Friday, March 12.  We thank everyone for their patience and understanding.</p>
<p>Discussion, questions on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179160" href="/#narrow/stream/179160-social">#social</a> please.</p>
