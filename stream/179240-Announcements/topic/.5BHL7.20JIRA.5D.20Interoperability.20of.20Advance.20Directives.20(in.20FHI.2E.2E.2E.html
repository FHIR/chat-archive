<p>From: <a href="mailto:webmaster@hl7.org">webmaster@hl7.org</a><br>
A new project proposal is available for your review - Interoperability of Advance Directives (in FHIR).  The project proposal process is intended to allow Work Groups to register their desire or intent to work on a project and to engage interested parties at an earlier stage than the Project Scope Statement (PSS). Some goals of this process are to help identify appropriate sponsors, cosponsors, or interested parties; eliminate redundancies; and promote community awareness of what work is coming in to HL7. Once the review period is complete and any comments are reconciled, the identified sponsoring WG may proceed to the creation and approval of a full Project Scope Statement.</p>
<p>You are invited to review the following project proposal at <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/PSS-1664">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/PSS-1664</a> and provide comments. Instructions for how to review a project proposal are available here: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/How+to+Create+and+Review+a+Project+Proposal">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/How+to+Create+and+Review+a+Project+Proposal</a></p>
