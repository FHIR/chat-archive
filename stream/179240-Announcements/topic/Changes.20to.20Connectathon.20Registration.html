<p>This is a heads up about connectathon registration for future connectathons. Here's an overview of the kind of changes that we are envisaging:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to register, you must meet a precondition:<ul>
<li>have attended a prior connectathon</li>
<li>have attended an appropriate alternative FHIR education session</li>
<li>are referred to the connectathon by a work colleague who has already attended</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if you don't meet the requirements, we'll be providing an educational session beforehand that you can register for and attend, and if you do this, then you'll be able to register for the connectathon</li>
<li>registration will close sometime before the connectathon (a week?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this is all provisional - we're still discussing the exact changes that we're going to make. </p>
<p>Why these changes? Connectathons are getting more difficult for everyone, particularly the track leads, and one reason is because in the new virtual connectathon world, we have many attendees who are coming to the connectathon because that they want to learn about FHIR. They're not finding the connectathon a rewarding experience, since it's not a good way to learn about FHIR <em>unless</em> you know what to expect from a connectathon</p>
