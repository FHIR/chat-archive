<p>Met a bunch of folks over the last few days who have a lot of Consumer UI/UX experience but are new to the Healthcare Domain and FHIR.  I shared with them what resources they could expect to find from APIs exposed to consumer Apps (a la the Argonaut project guidance).  At first I kind of laughed when they said the data was too complicated and not human friendly (I laugh because  all the UIs in the world look the same to me - they are just different views of the JSON) but I think they made a good point when they asked me "if anyone in the community has marked up the specs to highlight what data elements for a given resource are most relevant to a consumer".  Made me stop and think about it - we used to joke that the early portals were so lousy because they were basically rehashes of what doctors wanted to see.  </p>
<p>I am curious if anyone in the community has already started looking at what view of a given resource is most relevant for a consumer and find out if I can get connected with them.</p>
