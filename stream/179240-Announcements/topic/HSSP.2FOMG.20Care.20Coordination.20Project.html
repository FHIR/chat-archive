<p>The HSSP community is running a new project, a  FHIR based Care Coordination Service. The project:<br>
- plans to define services and profiles that allow care coordination across clinical teams for a patient (e.g. manage teams, care plans, etc)<br>
- expects to use FHIR resources, profiles, operations etc to define a "Care Coordination Service"<br>
- has use cases, and some preliminary architecture<br>
- plans to hold a connectathon track at the January meeting<br>
- is working towards an initial submission date of Feb 2017, and is being lead by AllScripts</p>
<p>The project is seeking participation from the FHIR community, including all those that are already working on (or have in production) solutions around coordinated care, both inside USA and outside as well.</p>
<p>I know that this is an area that many in the FHIR Community are interested in, and I'd encourage everyone to get involved in this - ideally, this would be a joint capture of our best practices in this area.  If you're interested, let me or Anuj (cc:ed to this email) know, and then we'll determine where project discussions should happen (<a href="http://chat.fhir.org" target="_blank" title="http://chat.fhir.org">chat.fhir.org</a>? FHIR email list? HSSP email list? a specific email list? FHIR workflow call? HSSP calls? comments welcome)</p>
