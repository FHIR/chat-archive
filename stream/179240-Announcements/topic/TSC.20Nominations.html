<p>Good Day,</p>
<p>This is a reminder to everyone that Nominations are currently underway for variety of HL7 Leadership positions. In particular I want to bring to your attention several positions on the TSC that are open for nominations, and encourage qualified individuals to submit a nomination. Nominations close on June 15th.</p>
<p>TSC Chair-Elect – Must have at least one of the following:<br>
•   Current or past members of the TSC<br>
•   A formal observer to the TSC for the past six month (50% attendance of the TSC conference calls and/or participating on a TSC sub-committee or task force)<br>
•   A current or previous Work Group Co-Chair<br>
•   Note that TSC Chair-Elect is 4 year commitment, including 1 years a TSC Chair-Elect, 2 years as TSC Chair, and 1 year as TSC Past-Chair.</p>
<p>Three TSC Working Group Representatives<br>
•   Must be a current or past Work Group Co-Chair<br>
•   Note the current TSC members are eligible for re-election<br>
•   Note that this is a 2 year commitment</p>
<p>One TSC Implementer Representative<br>
•   An individual that is an active, participating member of a product family implementer community with real world experience with product application development or implementation experience.<br>
•   Note that this is a 2 year commitment</p>
<p>One TSC Affiliate Representative<br>
•   Any representative of current Affiliate member<br>
•   Though not required, should be either a current or past WG co-chair<br>
•   Note that this is a 2 year commitment</p>
<p>Nomination information for all positions can be found here:<br>
<a href="http://www.hl7.org/participate/elections.cfm?ref=nav">http://www.hl7.org/participate/elections.cfm?ref=nav</a></p>
<p>The time requirements for participation in the TSC include approximately 3-5 hours a week. Below are some detailed time/travel expectations:<br>
•   Weekly 1  to 1.5 hour TSC meetings<br>
•   Expectation to participate in at least one TSC subcommittee or task force, meeting 1 hour per week on average<br>
•   Participate in the weekly TSC e-vote. The time spent on this varies, depending on the volume of items in e-vote, but probably less than an hour<br>
•   At this point, the TSC holds a 4-hour virtual meeting prior to the WGM. These were day long face to face meetings in the past, it’s not clear yet if we will go back to face to face prior to the WGM, or leave it virtual<br>
•   TSC Retreat, usually in conjunction with the Summer Board Retreat. This was virtual last year, and this year, but next year it will likely involve travel.<br>
The TSC Chair-Elect will have additional time requirements particularly during the period spent as TSC Chair that are sometimes difficult to quantify. </p>
<p>The Working Group, Implementer and Affiliate representative positions are all subject to a limit of 2 consecutive terms, and the current TSC members holding those positions are eligible to run for one additional term. Details on the above positions can be found in the HL7 Governance and Operations Manual section 8.02 (Annual Nomination and Election of HL7 Leadership by Administrative Ballot) and section 10 (Technical Steering Committee). <br>
