<p>Hi everyone! To elaborate on Josh's announcement about the HIT Developers Conference. The emphasis of this will be on SMART on FHIR. Representatives from Allscripts, Cerner, and Epic will all be presenting on their developer programs as well as their current and future SMART on FHIR capabilities, not to mention many other useful sessions on the topic. Would love to see you all there in New Orleans.  <a href="https://www.developers.hspconsortium.org/events" target="_blank" title="https://www.developers.hspconsortium.org/events">https://www.developers.hspconsortium.org/events</a></p>
