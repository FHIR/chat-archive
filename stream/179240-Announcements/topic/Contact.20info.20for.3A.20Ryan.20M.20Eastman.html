<p>As part of the normative balloting for FHIR R4, we need to get withdrawals from all negative voters if we want to avoid recirculation.  One of the negative voters is no longer with the company under whose email address the vote was submitted (Quest Diagnostics) and the firm has no current contact information for the individual.  If anyone knows where Ryan M Eastman is now and can put me in contact with them, please send me a private message.  Thanks for your help.</p>
