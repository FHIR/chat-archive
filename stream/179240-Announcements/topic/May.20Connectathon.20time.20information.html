<p>In the interest of helping everyone plan a bit better, the FMG met to discuss our plans around time-zone, etc. for the May FHIR Connectathon.  Information is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official opening will be Monday, May 17 at 4pm UK time (11am Eastern, 8am Pacific).  Closing will be at the same time on Wednesday, May 19</li>
<li>International track leads are expected to schedule meetings on the basis of UK times and ensure all scheduled timeslots are amenable to participation by participants based in that time-zone.   Similarly, any coordination calls involved in preparing for the connectathon should also be amenable to UK time-zone participants.</li>
<li>For U.S.-specific tracks, all education sessions that may be of interest to international participants are strongly encouraged to schedule such sessions at time that is reasonable for UK participants.</li>
<li>As always, actual 'work' can happen throughout the 48-hours the connectathon is open whenever participants happen to be awake and preparatory work and follow-up work coordinated through Zulip or elsewhere can happen at whatever time is agreeable to the participants</li>
</ul>
<p>Any discussions/questions, please direct to <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179160" href="/#narrow/stream/179160-social">#social</a></p>
