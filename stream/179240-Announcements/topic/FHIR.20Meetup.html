<p>It's been a long journey for all of us since we last met and we're excited to invite you to our next online FHIR® meetup.</p>
<p>Date: March 3, 2022<br>
Time: 12:00 PM - 2:30 PM PT</p>
<p>Large terminologies like SNOMED CT, RxNorm and LOINC are a foundational part of the FHIR applications but there’re still problems with distribution, versioning, updates and management of terminologies. During this meetup we’re going to overview the current state of terminology support in FHIR, discuss challenges that implementers come across when developing and using their solutions.</p>
<p>Lord of the Terms<br>
Speaker: @Grahame Grieve , FHIR product director for HL7 International</p>
<p>Practical approach to FHIR Terminology Services<br>
Speaker: @nicola (RIO/SS) , CTO for Health Samurai</p>
<p>FHIR Terminology Services with Ontoserver<br>
Speaker: @Michael Lawley who leads the Health Informatics Group at the Australian e-Health Research Centre, part of CSIRO, Australia’s National Science Agency.</p>
<p>Platform: Zoom. We want to make it really interactive.</p>
