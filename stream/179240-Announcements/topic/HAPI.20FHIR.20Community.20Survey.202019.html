<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>It is time for us to do another HAPI FHIR community survey. The survey is a not-quite-annual tradition that helps us to set priority for the coming year and get a pulse on how people are using HAPI FHIR.</p>
<p>We would very much appreciate if everyone could take a few minutes to fill it out. The survey is short (2 pages / 5 mins) so it shouldn't be much of a burden.</p>

<p>Please also feel free to circulate this link to help spread the word!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
James</p>
