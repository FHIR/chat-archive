<p>The CIMI workgroup (<a href="#narrow/stream/179157-cimi" title="#narrow/stream/179157-cimi">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179157-cimi</a>) is developing detailed vital signs profiles; these build on the basic simple rules found in the FHIR specification (base magic codes, and units) to specify a standard form for all the various qualification attributes, to make vital signs fully interoperable. </p>
<p>The project at this time has strong US participation, but there's no reason for the work to be US specific - it should be international. CIMI would like to build international involvement in their project. This is a call for interest from non-US participants (though US participants would also be welcome). If you are interested, please let <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194478">@Susan Matney</span> know at <a href="mailto:susan.matney@imail.org" title="mailto:susan.matney@imail.org">susan.matney@imail.org</a></p>
