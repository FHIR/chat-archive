<p>Through one of the projects I'm on we received some feed back on SANER that they would like us all to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>This data is more prized than PHI</li>
<li>Integrity of the data is highly suspect – systems don’t differentiate virtual versus real/physical beds, create double the numbers because of cleaning, same issues with ventilator numbers</li>
<li>Also having an issue because they're converting beds in real time to ICU beds and COVID beds further throwing off the numbers</li>
<li>They are currently building enterprise dashboards for the info – only have 20 people with access at Sutter – limited it to command center leaders and physicians</li>
<li>
<p>If you share this data it would be better to share the actual occupancy numbers to ICU, bed, ventilator – licensed beds or manually reported number of beds, but calculating the denominator to get total beds available is unwise<br>
** Should coordinate with the ADT teams from Epic, Cerner, Meditech <br>
** Data that would be helpful to share<br>
***  Tracking of PPE – personal protective equipment number – not tracking usage right now but would be incredibly helpful to share so folks know who to contact when they have shortages<br>
*** Availability of testing supplies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit data sharing to state agency officials only – worried that other hospitals will send patients because they think there are beds when there aren’t</p>
</li>
<li>Also concerned about sharing with CDC since those numbers would go to the WH even though they aren't accurate</li>
</ul>
