<p>The canonical measure in MeasureReport is 1..1.  If it can actually fulfill multiple Measures, there's no way to convey it.  Epic and Cerner both have measures we've defined internally.  When I generate a MeasureReport, internally it's linked to the corresponding Epic Measure.  </p>
<p>What if the definitions of the Epic Measure and the CDC Measure are the same?  For interoperability purposes, we're going to  want MeasureReport.measure to be the CDC Measure.  That means we lose the Epic Measure.  This isn't a big deal in this case - nobody cares that it's our Measure.  But what if CDC and FEMA each define Measures for the same metric?  Does a reporter need to create two copies of the same MeasureReport identical in every way but the measure?</p>

<p>Right now CDC and FEMA approaches are dealing with different data sets.  Measure.relatedArtifact can be used to reference related things (e.g., derived-from), though the relationships aren't exact.  The CDC measure isn't derived from the Epic measure and visa-versa, but we could punt that just to get the links made.  <br>
I also think this is a valid space to look for extensions that might help reference source data.</p>

<p>An icky alternative would be to use evalutatedResource(Measure) to point to the Epic measure if indeed the CDC Measure was actually computed based on Epic's measure rather than directly.<br>
Might be valid, not really the intent.</p>

<p>I agree - ick.</p>

<p>Rethinking ... if you are computing the CDC MeasureReport from one or more Epic MeasureReport instances, then derived-from is exactly the right code for relatedArtifact, but MeasureReport doesn't have relatedArtifact ... but there is a relatedArtifact extension already defined that is exactly that.</p>

<p>it would be the measure that is derived not the report</p>
