<p>Catching up with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="222054">@Gino Canessa</span> and we're confused on a few points (given our decision to wrap the entire CDC report in a single <code>MeasureReport</code>, and the entire FEMA report in another  single <code>MeasureReport</code>).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Did we decide that it's okay not to populate <code>Measure.type</code>, and instead add extensions at the <code>Measure.group</code> level to convey any necessary type info?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did we decide that it's okay not to populate <code>Measure.scoring</code>, and instead add extensions at the <code>Measure.group</code> level to convey any necessary scoring info?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did we decide that for <code>MeasureReport</code>, we won't constrain ourselves to a single scoring type across groups? (In other words, did we decide to allow for a mix of ratios and counts across the groups in a given report? In other other words: we shouldn't need to add "fake" denominators of <code>1</code> to simple count-type measures.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I <strong>believe the answer is yes</strong> to all three. Did anyone have a different take-away?</p>

<p>You _could_ do that, but you wouldn't be communicating the scoring semantics. Is that okay? I didn't see that as one Measure, I saw it as at least 3 for the CDC (for Location/Bed, Location/Ventilator, and Patient).</p>

<p>Yesterday on the call we decided between "3 MeasureReports that together correspond to the CDC form" and "1 MeasureReport that by itself corresponds to the CDC form" and we selected the latter. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191387">@Keith Boone</span> it'd be great if you can chime in here to make sure we're on the same page.</p>

<p>I tend to agree, it feels like working against the resource rather than with it, since the resource can already say these things, though it admittedly requires three, not one (at least for the CDC content).</p>

<p>The issue is currently in the FEMA reports - some fields are counts and some are ratios.  If we want to include all of them in the same <code>Measure</code> / <code>MeasureReport</code>, then we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>change all fields to proportions</li>
<li>have a mix of proportions and cohorts</li>
<li>exclude the ratios as they are based on counts already present</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, anyone consuming the FEMA report would know what the score for field 'x' is (e.g., if it's a count or a percentage).  In the first method, the generation isn't as simple (counts are added as ratios with denominator 1).  In the second method, we don't describe the scoring method at top level.  In the third, we rely on someone else doing additional processing.</p>
<p>If we don't like any of the choices, then we need to revisit the decision to have all of the fields in a single <code>Measure</code> / <code>MeasureReport</code>.</p>
<p>I assume that whatever path we take will be mirrored in the CDC version - which is simpler today, but can/will evolve over time (so needs to account for the possibility of ratios).</p>

<p>Also to be clear about what went into the decision yesterday: The goal is to make reports as clear and straightforward as possible. We are not trying to make the measure <em>definitions</em> themselves "simple", when this is at odds with making the <em>reports</em> simple.</p>

<p>Yes, since we are going to be developing the Measure resources in this project, with people who can get into some of the complexity of details.  But MeasureReport is what others would see (if they are lucky, some are just going to be seeing CSV files or even ick: XLSX files), because the idea is to slip into existing reporting mechanisms until they are able to consumer FHIR MeasureReport resources.</p>

<p>The choices result in different shapes of <code>...group.population</code> in measures and reports.  For example</p>
<ul>
<li>numTotBeds as cohort: population has one value of coding initial population</li>
<li>numTotBeds as proportion: population has two values: numerator (value) and denominator (1)</li>

<p>Having the report in ratios seems like it's a matter of presentation, in some regards.  Similar to C degrees vs F degrees.  The underlying metric is actually the same, but is being interpreted by different frameworks/jurisdictions.  Why not build the ratio portion into the application?  Why not have a microservice translate non-ratio reporting into ratioed reporting at the point of entering the new jurisdiction?</p>

<p>Thanks!  Pushed out updates.  The CDC and FEMA measures no longer specify a scoring model and have composite type.

<p>I am confused why the subject of the sanerCDC measurement group is Location as it includes ventilator and patient data.  Should we suggest that Measure.subject[x] can repeat?  Picking one does not work either.</p>

<p>We lost a place to put the guidance provided for each measure.  We could use group.code.text, but that does not seem right.  Suggest an extension of group.extension-guidance.  Alternative, could go into the population.criteria.description for either the numerator or denominator, whichever one fits best.  Then perhaps the expression is only used if computable.</p>

<p>In the examples I'm preparing, COVID 19 Patient measures aren't based on Location, but rather Encounter.<br>
That's because through Encounter, you can get to diagnosis, and condition reported in encounter, and location.<br>
So, three groups, Location, Order/Result, Encounter</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="222054">@Gino Canessa</span>  If Measure.author is meant to be the author of the FHIR expression of the measure, the definition should make that much more clear.  We should JIRA that.  We then need an extension on the Measure.relatedArtifact to capture the author there.<br>
relatedArtifact.extension-status does not exist yet.  I thought <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span> would address that.  May want to add author as well.<br>
I read the meaning of Measure.subject differently.  With the example value used, that would work on the MeasureReport, but would be too specific for the Measure definition as that is independent of that location.  Rather it is the FHIR resource that represents the source of the information (at least how I understood it).  That is not available in Measure.group where it wouuld be most applicable, while Measure.subject's use is questionable when the group includes different measures related to different FHIR resources.  Sounds like we need to discuss this.  I cannot make today's call, but would on Friday, or we need to grab some time tomorrow (12-1pm ET would work for me) with those interested to resolve.</p>

<p>These decisions are giving me heartburn... I feel like we are playin fast and loose with measure after all the work that has gone into the QM IG.  I think it exposed some gaps in the documentation either in the IG or the resources.  The basic question is how  making one big old measure a benefit? </p>
<p>Keith stated the benefit of the measure is to computationally create the MR.  <strong>But</strong>, if there is not standard approach to authoring measures then that concept is shot to hell. You are still stuck coding to each measure.</p>
