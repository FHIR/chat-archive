<p>Spinning this off of the metrics --- various uses of the National Health Network are possible</p>

<p>It does not have an ability to publish, just read history... intended to support disaster use-cases, not long-term care</p>

<p>yes it is a Document Sharing system... but nothing stops FHIR Documents, or even FHIR Resources from being used. The definition of a document is not the strict CDA definition, but a definition of something useful to the community</p>

<p>In some nations (not USA yet) they are using this to publish lists which are fragments of what one would find in a CCD.. such as an entry just for Allergy, another for Medications, etc.. SO, it could be used to publish simply a FHIR Observation that is the covid-19 test results... hence why I asked about that</p>

<p>Thank you for the softball <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span> Yes, in fact the Sequoia Project's PULSE initiative that John provided a link to above is actively working with our technology partner Audacious Inquiry.  Earlier this week, a specific PULSE-COVID19 version went live as a participant on the eHealth Exchange Network (look for Patient Unified Lookup Systems for Emergencies on this page: <a href="https://ehealthexchange.org/participants/" title="https://ehealthexchange.org/participants/">https://ehealthexchange.org/participants/</a>) .  All participants are being alerted that they may begin receiving queries from public health via this connection.  In addition, the eHealth Exchange is in the final testing processes to go live on the Carequality Framework that connects 24 other networks today.</p>

<p>Another thing to point out is that the policy framework that the eHealth Exchange Network has in place already connects 4 federal agencies (DOD, VA, SSA and CMS) with the legal data sharing agreements to allow exchange of clinical data.  All this to say that the connectivity is almost complete to allow for data access potentially with the Navy ships and other deployments by federal partners to assist in this need for the US.  We onboarded PULSE COVID19 in record time (2-3 days) through testing.  I applaud the ongoing efforts that Sequoia, eHealth Exchange and Carequality are making to start gathering all the information that is needed by providers and public health.  This currently deployed infrastructure could be augmented to support FHIR exchange of data and Carequality just announced on their informational call today that they are fast tracking their publication of a HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide.  The slides from the call with links to all draft guides can be found here: <a href="https://carequality.org/wiki/monthly-communication-call/" title="https://carequality.org/wiki/monthly-communication-call/">https://carequality.org/wiki/monthly-communication-call/</a>.   Note slide #6 for the COVID19 update and slide #9 for the FHIR workgroups update given by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="270627">@Dave Cassel</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="234848">@Bill Mehegan</span></p>
