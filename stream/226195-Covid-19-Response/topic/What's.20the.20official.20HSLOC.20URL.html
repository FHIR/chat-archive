<p>VSAC has it as <a href="http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/cs/hsloc">http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/cs/hsloc</a>, VADS as <a href="http://cdc.gov/nhsn">http://cdc.gov/nhsn</a>, I think it's actually <a href="http://cdc.gov/hsloc">http://cdc.gov/hsloc</a>, and the actual URL where it is defined is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/cdaportal/terminology/codesystem/hsloc.html">https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/cdaportal/terminology/codesystem/hsloc.html</a> (which would also work for me).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="279658">@Austin Kreisler</span>  Seems like this should be NHSN's call as to what it actually is.  Until they make a clear statement, the only thing everyone agrees on is the OID.</p>

<p>NHSN went through a lot of effort to make the last URL (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/cdaportal/terminology/codesystem/hsloc.html">https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/cdaportal/terminology/codesystem/hsloc.html</a>) our official source of truth for the HSLOC code system. After the fact we found out that HL7 Vocab doesn't like it for a FHIR vocab URL.</p>

<p>I honestly don't see what's wrong with it, NOR do I believe it's their choice.  It meets the specification for a URL.</p>

<p>incidentally what does it mean for them not to like it? Is this an aesthetic judgment or does it violate some rule of thumb?</p>

<p>And given that's the intent of the publisher of the code system for the FHIR URL, that's the ONE I'm going to use for connectathon.  I would also suggest that be documented in the page that defines the code system so that nobody else (HL7, VADS, VSAC or otherwise) is ever confused.</p>

<p>I expect one of our issues is the ".html" on the end - because the content that's retrieved when you use that resource as a canonical could be a variety of things - XML, JSON, RDF, HTML or possibly other stuff.</p>

<p>Not everyone has the luxury of controlling their corporate server's redirects.  I think we need to live with the limitations of the real world and not impose our hoped for ideals on organizations whose IT departments don't necessarily see eye to eye with us.</p>

<p>And using that value would sure beat the heck out of having three different published values which AREN'T what the publisher of the vocabulary intended  being published by systems which are supposed to be able to be relied upon by standards implementers in the US (HL7, VSAC and PHIN VADS).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191387">@Keith Boone</span> So you don't think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> point is worth pushing for? The rule, as noted in <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/VOC/Proposed+Vocabulary+WG+Policy+on+Creation+of+Canonical+URLs+for+UTG+Code+Systems">HTA's requirements</a> are clear. And yes, if .html for a jason artifact is not worthy of discussion for you I'm a bit surprised. All said, you are right, we have to take what they force us to take.</p>

<p>I think HL7's <strong>Advice</strong> and <strong>guidance</strong> is perfectly fine, and it's <strong>recomendation</strong> that It  <strong>should also not</strong> be specific to the format of the page.  Having said that, these ARE guidelines, not requirements, and having to navigate through the IT bowels of an organization that employs more than 20,000 people to get them to change the processes that they use for their organizational web presence is NOT something that you want to wade through to address a 6 month or more delay in publication of a FHIR endpoint URL.  Yeah, this is all easy web stuff, but finding the right person in IT who UNDERSTANDS THAT for an organization that large isn't.  Been there, done that.  It took a team of 5 many years to get that fixed at a former employer.</p>
<p>At the present time, the "URL" for HSLOC can at best be represented by an OID, even though CDC staff and contractors did everything they thought they needed to in order to create an appropriate URL.  It meets the general goals of FHIR, and this seems to me to be a case of perfection being the enemy of the good.  At this point, both HL7 AND VSAC have published TWO DIFFERENT FHIR URLS for this vocabulary, and NEITHER of them is the publisher of it, nor comes anywhere close to the publisher's intent.  That situation is even worse.</p>
