<p>HHS has updated reporting requirements this week:  <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/06/04/hhs-announces-new-laboratory-data-reporting-guidance-for-covid-19-testing.html">https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/06/04/hhs-announces-new-laboratory-data-reporting-guidance-for-covid-19-testing.html</a>  Shouldn't be too much of a change if folks were already reporting ELR, such as hospital labs for MU.  For non hospital labs (those excluded from MU incentives and requirements), and testing/collection locations such as drive up/through testing locations, more might be needed such as upgrading to 2015 certified versions of information systems as recommended or using standards such as LOINC and SNOMED CT and HL7 v 2.51.  It should help nudge labs to the same level of standards adoption so more results can be computer actionable.</p>

<p>Has there been any consideration of v2 mappings into the SANER specification?  I've been discussions with a CDC subcontractor about feeding v2 interfaces from their LIS reporting network into our FHIR proxy server to make them available to the SANER network.  </p>
<p>If we bring the players to the table to participate, is this a thing we could add to the upcoming SANER track?  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191387">@Keith Boone</span> ?</p>

<p>The FEMA measure is still available for testing in this connectathon (# of tests, tests cumulative, positive tests, and cumulative positive tests), so you could accept V2 data and produce measures.  We have nothing in SANER that talks about how you would do the compute from V2, that's really out of scope at this stage.</p>
