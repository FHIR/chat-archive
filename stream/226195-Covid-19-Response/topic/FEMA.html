<p>In reviewing the lab test portion of the sheet, looks like they want hospital based reporting, but it doesn't clarify whether they want all lab results performed by a hospital lab, even if for smaller community hospitals (where a larger hospital lab serves as a reference lab), or all the ambulatory physician providers in their community to which they are contracted or if only for inpatients of the hospital.  It also doesn't clarify if the hospital is sending their specimens to their state public health labs, if these would be in the counts (assume not, since not performed by the hospital lab).  </p>
<p>Are those of you working on reporting planning on getting these data directly from the hospital's laboratory information system (LIS)?  If feeds are from the EHR, it might miss tests performed for the ambulatory providers and those sent out to other laboratories if the hospital isn't performing testing in house/onsite, such as those performed by public health or independent labs.   Not sure if CLIA required Specimen Rejection Reason is also available in the hospital EHR for community providers (say those not part of health system and have their own EHR interfaced to the lab's LIS) which order/result from a performing hospital laboratory bypassing that hospital lab's EHR system.</p>

<p>Working through the FEMA sheet and have a question...  For the cumulative fields (e.g., "Cumulative Diagnostic Tests Ordered/Received" - "All tests ordered to date."), what is the period?  Is this asking for all tests a facility has ever ordered, from when they started reporting this data, or some other date I haven't found?</p>

<p>I definitely don't know, but would guess "ever" to the extent the reporting system can calculate.</p>

<p>In the current case, we could go back to the first identified case of COVID-19</p>

<p>What reporting system? ;)   I think for most they will need to build a custom report.  My laboratory colleagues are integrating data from the LIS and EHR for their facilities.</p>

<p>I'd argue the first order for a COVID-19 test for a suspected case/PUI.  It'll likely be whenever a facility began offering capability to order said testing whether via a Misc choice for rare/reference lab testing or when it was validated and offered by the hospital lab.  Although a number are sent to other hospitals offering testing such as Northwell, Northshore University Health, Stanford, or other independent reference labs such as Sonic.</p>

<p>Another question: what is the proper way to fill out the spreadsheet?  We've had a few ideas here, and they all feel plausible.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm thinking that A1 gets overwritten with the date, and the rest of row 1 receives the numerical data.  B4 and B5 then get the state (e.g., WI) and county (e.g., Dane).</p>
<p>Does that sound right?  (Context - working on tooling to export these)</p>

<p>Here's the latest guidance (April 10) from FEMA on what the hospitals are required to send to FEMA/HHS. <a href="https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2020/04/10/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-hhs-letter-hospital-administrators" title="https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2020/04/10/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-hhs-letter-hospital-administrators">https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2020/04/10/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-hhs-letter-hospital-administrators</a>. </p>
<p>Key phrases in the guidance: Authorize your health IT vendor or other third-party to share information directly with HHS. Publish to the hospital or facility’s website in a standardized format, such as <a href="http://schema.org" title="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>. <a href="https://schema.org/docs/cdc-covid.html" title="https://schema.org/docs/cdc-covid.html">https://schema.org/docs/cdc-covid.html</a>. </p>
<p>Are there projects that are being worked on to send this information electronically beyond <a href="http://schema.org" title="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191689">@Hans Buitendijk</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191864">@Isaac Vetter</span> Maybe the work going on in Chicago?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196361">@Ryan Howells</span> : For CDC NSHN there is progress to submit to CDC electronically and "copy" state/local.  Last I heard last week  was CDC was almost ready with their specs to submit electronically.  I might have missed the latest, although it is not on the CDC site yet.  There is another project in Chicago that is working on something FHIR based, but have not heard yet what their specs will look like.<br>
For FEMA they had a spreadsheet, but per the link you referenced, little further down below the <a href="http://schema.org" title="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> reference, they indicate that everybody received a special link and can submit data on tests through that form.  Unfortunately, beyond the 8 measures for FEMA, no further links, information, formats, provided.</p>

<p>Yea, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191689">@Hans Buitendijk</span> I was trying to see if we could better coordinate across these efforts. It seems like the CDC request, the Chicago work (which is being sent to their local public health agency), and this latest guidance could be the same data feed? It's also my understanding FEMA, CDC, <a href="http://et.al" title="http://et.al">et.al</a> didn't specify a format because they didn't know one exists (which I don't believe it does, yet). </p>
<p>We're all running in parallel paths. I was just hoping we could make this easier on everyone. I know there are a lot of "third-parties" who are doing this on behalf of their clients and building their own solutions. It seems highly duplicative at a time when hours/days matter . . . thoughts?</p>
