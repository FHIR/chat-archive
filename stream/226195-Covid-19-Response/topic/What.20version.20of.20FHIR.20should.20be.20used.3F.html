<p>R4 is the latest "stable" version, is it expected that everyone should be using R4? <br>
We could also use R5 Preview #1, but since we are using HAPI FHIR 4.2.0 we're limited to the current snapshot of R5 that HAPI FHIR 4.2.0 supports.</p>
<p>I don't think there's anything specific to R5 that would be needed right? Specifically talking about the Situation Awareness for Novel Epidemic Response track: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2020-05+Situation+Awareness+for+Novel+Epidemic+Response" title="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2020-05+Situation+Awareness+for+Novel+Epidemic+Response">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2020-05+Situation+Awareness+for+Novel+Epidemic+Response</a></p>
<p>It doesn't look like there are any differences in the MeasureReport resource between R4 and R5 Preview #1.</p>

<p>it's all R4 based</p>

<p>Sorry, another follow up on this. That seems to be at odds with the Confluence page for the Connectathon: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2020-05+Connectathon+24" title="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2020-05+Connectathon+24">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2020-05+Connectathon+24</a></p>
<p>It says "Read the Connectathon version of the FHIR Specification", and that links to: <a href="http://build.fhir.org/index.html" title="http://build.fhir.org/index.html">http://build.fhir.org/index.html</a><br>
And that appears to be FHIR version 4.2.0 which is R5 Preview #1, right?</p>

<p>I also just saw that there is a separate stream for "connectathon mgmt", is that meant to be used instead for Connectathon questions? In the kickoff webinar this "Covid-19 Response" stream was specifically linked to and the presenters said that this stream should be used for the Connectathon.</p>

<p>Update, I see on the track-specific page: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2020-05+Situation+Awareness+for+Novel+Epidemic+Response" title="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2020-05+Situation+Awareness+for+Novel+Epidemic+Response">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2020-05+Situation+Awareness+for+Novel+Epidemic+Response</a></p>
<p><strong>This track will use what version of FHIR</strong><br>
The SANER draft implementation guide is based on FHIR version R4 </p>
<p>So looks like for the Connectathon in general it's R5 Preview #1, but for this track specifically we're using R4 instead, since the SANER impl guide references that.</p>

<p>Just as an FYI... standards development proceeds at a different (slower) pace than software development.  Unlike open-source or even for-profit software, standards require balloting (voting) and consensus building, rather than just the latest publication of a library.  </p>
<p>So, the R5 Preview isn't exactly the development branch or pre-release that you might be accustomed to.  Rather, that's where the report-out from after the connectathon lands.  It's downstream in the standards development process, and what we are feeding into; not what people should be using during the connectathon itself.  </p>
<p>Keep in mind that a lot of the FHIR servers in production at hospitals are still on DSTU2 in the United States, and on STU3 in Europe.   For those production systems, the R4 release _is_ the latest version that they're trying to move towards.  So stick with R4.  The R5 Preview should be considered alpha/experimental, rather than beta/testing ready.</p>

<p>Also, if you're in the US, the R4 version is what was officially adopted by HHS and Medicare.  It's the one specified in law, not R5 Preview.  Err on the side of compliance rather than latest release or preview.  We might be using similar terms, but the R5 Preview means something different in this context than much of the rest of the software world.</p>

<p>R4 is what the SANER Track should be using, since that's what we are building the guide upon, and what we said in the track proposal.</p>

<p>The only reason to use the R5 Preview is because your IG needs the changes that have happened since R4 (turtles...). There are some IG that have told the FHIR authorities that they need a R5 ish release. This is why it is created. Not because they want everyone to us it, they actually prefer no one needs a non formal release; but it is a fact of life.</p>
