<p>I've included four of the value-sets developed and published via <a href="http://mcovid.org" title="http://mcovid.org">mcovid.org</a> into the Saner IG, but there's some things the IG publisher doesn't like about them (no errors, just warnings).</p>
<ol>
<li>They don't have a description.</li>
<li>The name is not computer friendly</li>
</ol>
<p>I also don't like the fact that while they have name for the computer, they are missing a title (in fact, what is now name should be title, and name should be a transform from title to a computer friendly value, camel-case, pascal-case, or _ separated words would be fine.<br>
