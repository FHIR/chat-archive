<p>This is informal survey about clients that access APIs.  In my standard API framework, I prefer to use a custom header to direct the request through the back-end.  There were good reasons for that in the development of FHIR oriented workflows.  Thats fine in Postman but I don't know if this is generally true with REST clients.  Would including a custom header be problematic for anyone that will be making requests to my API for Connectathon.  It is always a single custom header named 'add-service-properties' and contains a valid JSON string.</p>

<p>I'm sure I could figure out a way to do it, but it wouldn't be my first priority during the event.</p>

<p>From my experience: a service that requires extra headers (especially non-standard headers) is going to make it much harder for folks to test with your service (and if there are other services available to test with, often people will skip your service if it has "extra requirements").</p>
