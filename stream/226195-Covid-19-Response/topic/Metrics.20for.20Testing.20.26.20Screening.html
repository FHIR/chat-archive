<li>denominator: All visits and admissions during the reporting period</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Screening Rate</strong> - percentage of patient care contacts for which the patient was screened for communicable disease on the day of the contact</p>

<p><strong>Screening</strong><br>
Individual healthcare organizations define what represents a COVID-19 disease screening in their systems.<br>
Healthcare providers conduct the screening.</p>
<p>Screening typically consists of questions where the patient:</p>
<ul>
<li>Answers Yes or No to questions about whether they have been in contact with someone who is sick.</li>
<li>Answers Yes or No to questions about whether they have been in contact with anyone who has been tested as presumptive positive for COVID-19.</li>
<li>Describes any symptoms of a communicable disease that they have.</li>
</ul>
