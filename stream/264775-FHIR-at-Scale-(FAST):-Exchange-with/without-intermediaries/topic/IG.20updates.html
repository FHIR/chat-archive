Is the word "originator" in the header supposed to say "destination"?</p>

<p>Also there are a few references to signing payloads, but I don't see details on how this is accomplished; is that out of scope?</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> for reviewing. Yes... good catch, that should be "destination". I'll fix that</p>
<p>I'll let <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196338">@Patrick Murta</span> weigh in regarding signing of the payload and how that fits in to the scope. It was definitely discussed as an influencer of certain constraints specified in the guide, like requiring the destination referencing its public URL in returned resources (which is what the originator would expect to see) rather than having intermediaries rewrite those URLs in the payload on the way back to the originator.</p>

<p>The IG does make one statement regarding signing of content (on the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-exchange-routing-ig/branches/main/specification.html#trust-between-participants">Specification page</a>):<br>
<em>The payload and token SHALL be signed by the destination and delivered without modification to the originator.</em></p>

<p>That was one of the references to signing that I was wondering about: it's a requirement to sign, but.. how is this accomplished?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="238597">@Frank McKinney</span> ,  regarding the requirement to sign, I don't believe we should necessarily reference that is this IG since we are documenting 'passive' pass through intermediary activity.  I think signing will need to be a discussion with the security folks and potentially documented there.</p>
