<p>What types of auth are we including in intermediary support?</p>

<p>For patient-mediated exchange, are we expecting to use a authorization_code flow access token?  If so, do we need to think about allowed audiences in the SMART spec, so that the requestor knows that the intermediary is an allowed audience for a token that is likely to have been issued by the resource holder's auth servers?</p>

<p>If we're looking at client_credentials flow, then would we need the intermediary to proxy the oauth2 token endpoints of the resource holder's auth server?</p>
