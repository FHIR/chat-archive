<p>Hi all. Our Tuesday working sessions have yielded a couple block votes that we'll be bringing to FHIR-I on Monday...<br>

<p>I'll post the date these will be voted on by FHIR-I once that's been set.</p>
<p>We'll continue to meet weekly on Tuesdays at 1ET throughout April. Meeting details are on the HL7 calendar</p>

<p>Typos and other minor "Technical Corrections" don't need votes.</p>

<p>Ah, right. Thanks for the reminder, Dave.<br>
 I just reviewed the typo-fix group to confirm they all fit the technical correction category, and I renamed the group <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/issues/?jql=project+%3D+%22FHIR+Specification+Feedback%22+AND+Specification+%3D+%22US+Hybrid%2FIntermediary+Exchange+%28FHIR%29+%5BFHIR-us-exchange-routing%5D%22+AND+created+%3E%3D+2021-12-01+AND+created+%3C%3D+2022-01-11+AND+cf%5B11401%5D+%3D+typo-fix+ORDER+BY+key">typo-fix</a> for tracking.</p>
<p>So to correct my earlier post, we'll be bringing <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/issues/?jql=project+%3D+%22FHIR+Specification+Feedback%22+AND+Specification+%3D+%22US+Hybrid%2FIntermediary+Exchange+%28FHIR%29+%5BFHIR-us-exchange-routing%5D%22+AND+created+%3E%3D+2021-12-01+AND+created+%3C%3D+2022-01-11+AND+cf%5B11401%5D+%3D+block-vote-1+ORDER+BY+key">block-vote-1</a> to FHIR-I Monday and will inform them of the technical corrections applied.</p>
