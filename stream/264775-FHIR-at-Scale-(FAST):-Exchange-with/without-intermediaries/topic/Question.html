<p>Hey guys. I was a part of the SANER track, specifically. I saw your presentation/demo. That was interesting stuff. I had two questions:</p>
<p>Have you guys discussed the effects large data sets (possible long open connections) might have on this data flow?<br>
Have you guys discussed what happens when errors occur at a hop (e.g. an intermediary node goes down) and how retries might work?</p>

<p>Hey Heather...  thanks for the participation and questions.  Here are my thoughts.  1) For large data sets, synchronous APIs are not always a good idea but the bulk data FHIR asynchronous model is.  It can use our approach as well without holding connections open for too long 2) We have, but we plan to handle that in a separate IG for 'intermediary scale'.  There are existing patterns that handle that well today that we can use.</p>

<p>1.) Totally agree. But, given the main protocol being used here is HTTP, I figured I'd ask about that. SFTP and other protocols can handle large files well enough but given we are trying to improve interoperability through FHIR, I was wondering how that might work.<br>
2.) Ahhh, OK. I'm new to the "IG" stuff. What is the existing pattern within FHIR to handle retries? HTTP/REST requires the individual hops to implement their own handling of retries. So, I was just curious about how this might work.</p>

<p>Is there a link to the presentation for those who were not part of the Connectathon?  Or maybe a video recording?</p>

<p>Yeah,  the Bulk FHIR IG is meant to handle exactly what you are describing so as not to have HTTP timeout issues</p>

<p>Bulk FHIR IG. Too many tracks, so little time <span aria-label="sob" class="emoji emoji-1f62d" role="img" title="sob">:sob:</span></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192685">@Vassil Peytchev</span>  you can find links to presentations on our track page in addition to a recorded track orientation session we did back in December: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2021-01+FHIR+at+Scale+%28FAST%29%3A+Exchange+with+or+without+intermediaries">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2021-01+FHIR+at+Scale+%28FAST%29%3A+Exchange+with+or+without+intermediaries</a>.  Recordings from the sessions today will be posted by HL7.</p>
