<p>Question re: the "Option 1" scenario that we want to test at next week's HL7 FHIR CAT28.  I have our POC acting as intermediary working to extract out hostname and use it to identify the target responder (or next hop).  But - I still require a specific port and app path.  For example, the following works and gets routed to <a href="http://FHIR.Actor2.org">FHIR.Actor2.org</a> FHIR Server:</p>
<p><a href="http://FHIR.Actor2.org:52774/fhirproxy/fast/r4/Patient/123">http://FHIR.Actor2.org:52774/fhirproxy/fast/r4/Patient/123</a></p>
<p>but notice that I require a specific port, and also the /fhirproxy/fast/r4 app path - as that is the baseURL of our intermediary service.</p>
<p>Is the expectation that the Actor1 initiator would be sending request as follows?</p>
<p><a href="http://FHIR.Actor2.org/Patient/123">http://FHIR.Actor2.org/Patient/123</a> or <a href="https://FHIR.Actor2.org/Patient/123">https://FHIR.Actor2.org/Patient/123</a></p>
<p>If that is the case - it will be more difficult.  The intermediary would have to support default port (80 or 443), and have no app path for it's service.  Not sure any intermediary would support that.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I'm looking into using web server redirects to accept whatever comes in on port 80 and routing to  our custom port 52774, along with modifying the app path to include our service's required "/fhirproxy/fast/r4" base URL.  I can do this only because port 80 on this instance currently isn't being used for any other service.</p>

<p>Yes, the path is tricky - as originally conceived, my assumption is the directory accessed by actor 1 (the initiator) to find actor 2 (the final destination) would have a hostname and app path that is appropriate for actor 2 but the hostname would direct the request to the intermediary.  That approach would hopefully avoid URL rewriting as the app path would match the destination.</p>

<p>The hostname string (which routes to the intermediary)could be standardized to convey port and/or path information for the intermediary but you would likely need to use dashes in the hostname.  For example,  <a href="http://FHIR-stdport-Rfour.actor2.org">FHIR-stdport-Rfour.actor2.org</a>.  With this approach, we would need to have a standard port available (like port 80) so that the hostname information could be interpreted by that listener.</p>

<p>otherwise, actor 1 would need to convey information for the intermediary using headers or the app path (or something along those lines) which is what we were trying to avoid.</p>

<p>This is getting really tricky.  </p>
<p>If we want the fullURL values to NOT need to be re-written, then we'd need the original request from the initiator (Actor1) to look exactly like the ultimate responder wants it to look:  hostname, port, apppath - all of it.  But what if the ultimate responder uses something other than 80 or 443?  Would an intermediary then effectively have to support any/all ports?  </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Actor2 endpoint is <a href="https://mikey.healthcare.org:59500/mikecare/fhir/r4.0.1">https://mikey.healthcare.org:59500/mikecare/fhir/r4.0.1</a></p>
<p>If we want the initiator Actor 1 to be able to use URL values returned by Actor2 through an intermediary, then the request would be sent by Actor1 to Intermediary1 as <a href="https://mikey.healthcare.org:59500/mikecare/fhir/r4.0.1/Patient/123">https://mikey.healthcare.org:59500/mikecare/fhir/r4.0.1/Patient/123</a> (for example).  This means Intermediary 1 would have to be listening on port 59500 for requests.</p>
<p>Now extrapolate out the fact that target responders may all have different ports - and you can see that the Intermediary would be in a position of having to listen on ALL of those ports.</p>
<p>I don't see that being feasible.</p>

<p>For Mike's question, DNS alone wouldn't take care of the "no URL rewriting" need: <a href="https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/55123/can-dns-point-to-specific-port">https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/55123/can-dns-point-to-specific-port</a>. So yes, if any ultimate responders use specific ports in their FHIR base URL, then the intermediary would have to listen on those ports. But not all ports, just the ones needed by responders.</p>
<p>Have we nailed down what are actual requirements vs. nice to haves? Specifically the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>MUST use the same mechanism for all hops</li>
<li>Mechanism MUST work without requiring rewriting of URLs</li>
</ol>
<p>If neither 1 or 2 are real SHALLs, then each hop can be entirely independent, and something like the eHx idea of query strings should be ok for its A-&gt;B hop if their clients agree to it. The B-&gt;C hop can be converted to app path routing , X-Dest, etc. The only implied end-to-end requirement I see is that each ultimate responder has an address that is knowable/discoverable at each hop.</p>
<p>If #1 is nice to have and #2 is real, then I'm envisioning a situation A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D, where B claims conformance to this IG as an intermediary, but C only claims conformance as a server (with multiple endpoints). C could use unspecified mechanisms to route to D, as long as it rewrites URLs on the way out. A and B would be none the wiser. This might be appropriate for a vendor network.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That is most definitely not a MUST - I would rather say this is the price of admission as a FHIR intermediary.</p>
<p>I am not sure I understand the original question - if we are saying that the intermediary is providing a service for <code>actor2.org</code>, the way to use DNS to manage that would be to use a sub-domain, <code>fhir1.actor2.org</code>, to represent the endpoint. Rewriting this to further point to a URL with a specific port to properly process the requests is standard functionality for a reverse proxy. Am I missing the point?</p>

<p>I don't have a FHIR server for this track, but if there are questions and a need to experiment with DNS settings, I may be able to set up a web server that could be used to try things out.</p>

<p>If goal is for the initiator (Actor1) to not know whether the request is routed through an intermediary chain or direct to the responder, their directory entry must contain the hostname, port, and app path of the target destination.  If that then routes directly to the target responder - it would be successful (given appropriate security model is adhered to).  If, though, that routes through an intermediary chain (1 or more), then the intermediary must be able to accept that hostname/port/app path combo, determine the next hop based on the hostname, and then route accordingly.  The intermediary will use the hostname to lookup the next hop within the intermediary's directory.</p>
<p>I believe eHx as intermediary is prepared to support testing of a request such as <a href="http://FHIR.Actor2.org/Patient/123">http://FHIR.Actor2.org/Patient/123</a></p>
<p>We are NOT prepared to support <a href="http://FHIR.Actor2.org/Actor2AppPath/Patient/123">http://FHIR.Actor2.org/Actor2AppPath/Patient/123</a>.  But I might be able to make that work by the time we are finished testing today.</p>
