<p>I'm participating in the endpoint directory track, so I'm not sure I'll be in the active discussions on the intermediary track, but I heard on the recording there was a subgroup working on the re-writing issue?  It seems  like there are four different categories of URLs that would need to be re-written:</p>
<ol>
<li>Location headers (e.g. on create interaction responses)</li>
<li>Bundle fullUrls (on search interaction responses)</li>
<li>Reference data types (specifically, literal references if using app paths, but also relative if using query strings).</li>
<li>Other non-reference Uri types (e.g. attachment.url).</li>
</ol>
<p>#4 seems especially tricky, since the attachment.url may or may not be related to the FHIR server.  I'm not really sure how an intermediary could know whether it should re-write that except by checking if a substring of teh URL matches the URL of the FHIR endpoint.</p>
