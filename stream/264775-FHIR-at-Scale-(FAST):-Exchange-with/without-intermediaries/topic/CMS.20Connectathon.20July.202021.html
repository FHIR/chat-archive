<p>Hi Frank - perhaps we can add a note that if anyone wants to test AppPath routing - they need to coordinate with Mike McCune or myself - because by default that is disabled due to the fact that it conflicts with other routing options.  Not a big deal - but important if anyone wants to test that routing option outside of the connectathon.</p>
