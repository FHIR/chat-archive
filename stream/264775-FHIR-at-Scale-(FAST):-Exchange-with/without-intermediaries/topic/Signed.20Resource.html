<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="222054">@Gino Canessa</span> , at our last meeting, you mentioned the 'signed' resource approach as playing into this solution.  I see this as complementary  but not part of the core solution but perhaps I am not fully appreciating your perspective.  Do you have a link or can you provide additional information?</p>

<p>Hi Patrick, I'm trying to remember exactly what we were talking about, but it's been a minute  =).  But generally speaking, I think that signatures and/or Provenance are going to be an important part of the story once data starts being routed through intermediaries.</p>
<p>For example, if I am not receiving a <code>MedicationRequest</code> directly from Provider A, how do I know it is authentic?  There is an assumed level of trust via the intermediary, but it opens up a lot of vectors for a bad actor.  E.g., Bad Actor B telling an intermediary that a record came from Provider A.</p>
<p>I think that when we talk about things like patient matching, it is even more important to have a story for provenance/chain of trust.  If the patient demographics weren't an exact match, I may want/need to do additional verification before dispensing a controlled substance, etc.</p>
<p>With all of that said, I am not sold <em>yet</em> on the current story in FHIR for signing and Provenance (though I believe Provenance is a closer fit).  I'll also be upfront and say that I don't have a better story - right now I'm working* on trying to fully qualify/describe the problem space.  Thus far, I believe it is the same set of issues for intermediaries as it is for a patient-centric flow (e.g., I have my records on my local device and want to give them to a new provider), so I think it's something that will be getting more attention in the near future.</p>
<p>*"working" is probably too generous until my schedule opens up more, but I'm at least "thinking" =)</p>
