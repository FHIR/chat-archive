<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span>  - I have a few contacts for FHIR clients that are working on writing data in to Epic.  I'm not sure if they'll want to join every week.  I was wondering if we wanted to dedicate one of our weekly calls (6/2?) specifically to getting inputs from clients.  I can ask my contacts to join for that week.   If the want to join for other weeks, great, but since this will (probably) be their first touchpoint with Argonaut and standards development, I want to make sure we are using their time well, especially for the first session they join.</p>
