<p>Has there been discussion around the merits of documenting a primary care physician within a Coverage? I didn't see anything in the resource that would permit us to re-use for the profile, so I think we'd need to have a profile-specific extension much like how US Core handles Patient.extension:birthsex.</p>
<p>As far as a use case goes, Coverage is fairly similar to an enhanced digital insurance card, which often lists a PCP as a recommended (required?) first point of contact.</p>
<p>This could of course live instead within the C4BB Patient.generalPractitioner, but in that case we'd want to also tweak that profile to demand a C4BB profile vs the underlying FHIR resources themselves.</p>
