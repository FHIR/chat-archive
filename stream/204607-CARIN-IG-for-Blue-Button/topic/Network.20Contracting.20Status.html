<p>Hello, all. I am trying to gain a better understanding of what is needed for billing network contracting status backbone element and other network contracting status backbone elements as well. The billing provider can be contracted to perform multiple services. While the provider may be contracted for a service on line 1, it may not be contracted to a service on line two. Yet, the billing network contracting slice does not repeat and is not tied to a claim line. Am I misinterpreting the intent of these groupings of attributes? The attending, referring and other such providers are not the ones t hat are contracted like the billing provider so the contracting status is dependent upon the billing provider related to them.</p>
