<p>Working with CMS on delivery of claims and financial data for ACO management/reporting.  Most of the data is provided via the EOB and Coverage resources, but some of the data elements are things like <strong>risk flags</strong>, <strong>risk scores</strong> and <strong>enrollment flags</strong>.  I'm looking for a home for these types of elements.  When I previously posted <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Basic.20as.20an.20esoteric.20resource/near/226159651">this same question</a> in #implementers, I was given direction to consider using the Observation resource which does make sense (viewing them as  "point-in-time assertions").  We have also considered RiskAssessment as well as EnrollmentRequest/Response, but those don't seem to be a good fit and/or are lacking a bit in maturity.  While I like the idea of using Observation, wondering if there are any other options that we might be overlooking - or any other thoughts in general.</p>
