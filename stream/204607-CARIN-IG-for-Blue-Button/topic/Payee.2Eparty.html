<p>In Payee.party there is a Must Support flag and 1..1 cardinality.  However, in the comments, it is stated that you do not need to provide if subscriber or    provider.  I am not clear on how to handle an element when must support flag and cardinality state the element  is required. Can anyone provide assistance?</p>

<p>If I am understanding your question correctly you would like to include a instance of payee that does not include a party? In this case I would exclude the instance altogether given that party is a required element of payee. ExplanationOfBenefit.payee has a card of 0..1 if you need to express an ExplanationOfBenefit that had no payee.</p>
