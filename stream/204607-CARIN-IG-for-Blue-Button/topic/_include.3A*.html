<p>When the IG says serves SHALL support <code>_include=ExplanationOfBenefit:*</code>, is the intention that this query </p>

<p>I believe this would mean any search parameter of type=reference that the server supports. For the purpose of this IG, that means the ones listed as supported in the IG (option 1), but would not preclude servers from supporting more.</p>

<p>There is certainly some work that can be done in better defining a search parameter requirements and expectations. I do believe the intent was to, at a minimum, provide the full set of otherwise defined includes for ExplanationOfBenefit.</p>

<p>I am not familiar with the history of this area on the IG, but looking at it, it seems the intent was to act as a sort of specialized $everything. It does not make much sense for patient to be a search parameter because all searches in this IG are performed by the patient and will only have access to their data.<br>
I have added a ticket. <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32982">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32982</a><br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="243554">@Pat Taylor</span> , Is the intent to be able to retrieve the referenced resources after the EoB has been retrieved or to be able to retrieve the EoB and all referenced resources together? The former is handled through GET operations using the references in the EoB, the latter is handled through an _include. As defined right now, the _include is problematic because they are supposed to only be resources that are also search parameters. The resources can be retrieved separately without the use of _include.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191529">@Corey Spears</span> The intent is to allow the app to either retrieve the referenced resources after the EOB has been retrieved or to retrieve the EOB and all reference resources together.  However, the reference resources cannot be retrieved without first retrieving the EOB; i.e., they are always retrieved within the context of the EOB</p>

<p>I'm worried that defining the behavior of <code>*</code> in an IG specific way will prevent servers from supporting this IG alongside other IGs. (Imagine if each IG imposed its own rules for how <code>*</code> worked...)</p>

<p>I don't perceive an actual difference here - I think people are talking past each other.</p>
<p>The IG requires support for 5 particular _includes, as per the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/CapabilityStatement-c4bb.html#resource--details">capability statement</a>. 4 of them are standard search params (I think insurer isn't? maybe an oversight there?) It does not require the ability to search by these params, but it's not forbidden. You could trigger any of these includes individually.</p>
<p>The IG also requires _include:*. As per the standard, this will trigger every _include that the server supports, which will definitely be at least those 5 and potentially more.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://build.fhir.org/search">http://build.fhir.org/search</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both _include and _revinclude use the wild card "*" for the search parameter name, indicating that any search parameter of type=reference be included.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--&gt; This is different from the CARIN IG guidance.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>A Server SHALL be capable of supporting the following _includes:
ExplanationOfBenefit:patient - GET [base]/ExplanationOfBenefit?[parameter=value]&amp;_include=ExplanationOfBenefit:patient
ExplanationOfBenefit:provider - GET [base]/ExplanationOfBenefit?[parameter=value]&amp;_include=ExplanationOfBenefit:provider
ExplanationOfBenefit:care-team - GET [base]/ExplanationOfBenefit?[parameter=value]&amp;_include=ExplanationOfBenefit:care-team
ExplanationOfBenefit:coverage - GET [base]/ExplanationOfBenefit?[parameter=value]&amp;_include=ExplanationOfBenefit:coverage
ExplanationOfBenefit:insurer - GET [base]/ExplanationOfBenefit?[parameter=value]&amp;_include=ExplanationOfBenefit:insurer
</code></pre></div>
<p>... which defines <code>_include</code> requirements without regard to search parameters. I think there's also a question of what the CARIN IG expects should happen with <code>_incldue=*</code> -- is the expectation that clients will get these five things, or <em>at least</em> these five things? The latter would help, and is worth spelling out if that's the intention.</p>

<p>To be clear, I don't think there's a huge issue here. Just want emphasize that implementers supporting the CARIN BB IG can/should use their existing <code>_include=*</code> behavior and shouldn't <em>limit</em> it to "just the CARIN five fields".</p>
