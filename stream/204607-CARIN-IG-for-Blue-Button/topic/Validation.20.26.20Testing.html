<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm curious if anyone knows of any planned tools for testing the CARIN BB IG.  Our plan was to utilize Touchstone as they appear to have a group of tests for Patient Access conformance (US Core, Formulary, Provider Directory) .  This group of tests seems to be missing anything related to testing EOB and Claims.  Does anyone have insight into this?  </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I found that Inferno has an online validator that lets you apply the CARIN BB IG.  <a href="https://inferno.healthit.gov/validator/">https://inferno.healthit.gov/validator/</a>  This will at least allow me to prove our resources conform.  I'll just have to keep an eye on Touchstone to see if they come up with a more formal test suite in the future.</p>
