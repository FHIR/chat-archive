<p>What is the expected mapping for Coverage.type? The codeset has mixed concepts - medical has sub types like HMO, PPO, POS, etc... And those subtypes can be broken down into lower level such as a subsidy (SUBSIDIZ),  and those subtytpes can be broken down if an account has a health spending account (HSAPOL). At what level should we be expected to map?</p>

<p>Anything with a 0..1 card without must support would be outside of scope of IG. Is Coverage.type included in CPCDS?</p>

<p>Coverage.type does not have a must support flag.  Are you saying the  IG expects payors to not provide the information? We know the coverage, just depends on the hierarchy expectation.</p>

<p>You're allowed to provide content that isn't mustSupport, just not expected to do so.  The IG provides no guidance on mapping because it's not trying to create interoperability on that element - presumably because it's not necessary for the use-case that defines the scope for the IG.</p>
