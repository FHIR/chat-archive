<p>The CARIN Alliance formally submitted new Data Classes and Data Elements in the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability, version 3. The CARIN Alliance submitted two new Data Classes and proposing a modification to an existing Data Class. These are derived from the CARIN Implementation Guide for Blue Button® Common Payer Consumer Data Set (CPCDS). The CPCDS is a logical data set (similar to ONC 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set) that meets CMS Blue Button 2.0 API content and defines key payer financial health data.</p>
<p>Once the CARIN Alliance's submission has been posted on the USCDI website, we will post a link here. Formal comments to existing USCDI elements can be made here: <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi">https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi</a></p>
<p>CARIN also submitted a letter to Dr. Micky Tripathi, the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, which includes a list of the Data Classes and Data Elements, which can be found below:</p>

<p>In submitting these Data Elements, we realize that there may be some overlap or duplication that could occur and would welcome input from ONC and the community. We would also appreciate suggestions to combine or rename the Data Elements that were submitted.</p>
