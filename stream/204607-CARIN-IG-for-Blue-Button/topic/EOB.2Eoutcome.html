<p>In context to CMS does the EOB resource stores only the adjudicated claims; if so then how are the rest of the code valueset being used of element EOB.outcome<br>
<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-remittance-outcome.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-remittance-outcome.html</a></p>
<p>The other context which comes in is the valueset is being pinted to remittance so is the outcome column being used instead for payment process status from the payer?<br>

<p>In the context of the CMS Patient Access API for which the CARIN for Blue Button IG is used, the requirement is that adjudicated claims be made available. While the IG states that the expected code supplied would be "complete", it does not restrict the use of other outcome codes. This means it is possible to also provide claims that have a different outcome.</p>

<p>The notes say ".outcome:  value = complete"</p>
<p>Perhaps  the profile and the comment should be made consistent?</p>

<p>I agree. There are 3 different expressions between the element binding, the element comments and the notes. The only one of these three that get validated is the element binding. I have noticed some inconsistencies between the notes, the original mapping, and what was in STU1. I imagine this may have been due to changes over time. In preparation for STU2 I am doing a full review and will address these with the project team.</p>

<p>After following up with the CARIN BB team, the intent for STU1 was to keep this open with guidance of the usual case (outcome = complete), but after some deliberation, there is an intent to restrict this to completed claims only in STU2.</p>
