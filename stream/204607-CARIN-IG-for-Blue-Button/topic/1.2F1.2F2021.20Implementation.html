<p>Given that our company must implement a Patient Access API by 1/1/2021, I am wondering when the CARIN BB IG will be finalized for implementation? I see important changes coming in the CI build, but releasing code to production based on a CI build isn't something I'd recommend. Any guidance here is appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks ... Charlie</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="283867">@Charlie Filkins</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="216373">@Christopher Marchand</span> We are working through 237 ballot comments where we need to develop a response, disposition, convey that information to the HL7 community to gather feedback and ensure we have consensus, vote in the FM workgroup, and then publish them in a CI build. After Tuesday, we believe we'll be down to two buckets of open ticket items: </p>
<p>1) 49 tickets that relate to terminology which HTA and FM are working on resolving <br>
2) 46 open tickets the CARIN IG for Blue Button® team to resolve with the HL7 community </p>
<p>FYI, we recently published an updated build here: <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/branches/master/index.html">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/branches/master/index.html</a> and anticipate another CI build by the end of July. You can view the latest status for each of our issues in HL7's JIRA. Anyone in the HL7 community can join our ballot reconciliation calls for the latest updates. You can find the call-in information here: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CAR/CARIN+BB+IG+Ballot+Reconciliation">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CAR/CARIN+BB+IG+Ballot+Reconciliation</a>. If you have specific question, please feel free to ask them here. Hope that helps!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196361">@Ryan Howells</span> Do you expect that this next release will be the one of 1/1/2021 or should we stick to the latest published release (v0.1.0)?</p>

<p>The continuous build (<a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/toc.html">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/toc.html</a>) should be referenced as the most recent version because it incorporates the 180+ JIRA ticket items that have been approved by the HL7 community since the beginning of the year. Currently, that's v.0.3.1 but there will be at least couple of more CB versions published over the next few weeks as the HL7 JIRA tickets get discussed and approved. The published release from January is significantly out of date.</p>

<p>The practical outcome is to, at a minimum, state your version of C4BB compatibility (in C4BB CapabilityStatement).</p>
<p>This will still confuse app developers, who will in all likelihood be expecting the latest release. Moreover, app clients are not required to assert their compatibility to the server. It's very possible to have an app client implicitly assume latest, while the server is using a prior version (as correctly indicated in the server CapabilityStatement).</p>
<p>For future reference, in interim release v0.1.3 (8 September 2020), the version convention is changed to: <code>Release.Ballot.Version</code><br>
This means that what Howells refered to as <code>v.0.3.1</code> precedes <code>v0.1.2</code> (because v0.1.2 uses the updated versioning convention).</p>

<p>Actually, v0.3.1 comes after v0.1.2. The reason why is because we recently needed to update the versioning to conform with HL7's standard. The HL7 version naming convention is: v.b.r<br>
v = published version number.   We are trying to get to "1", but are currently pre-publication of 1.0, so we are v = 0<br>
b = ballot number for this version.   CARIN IG for BB has been balloted once, so b = 1<br>
r = revision number.   The IG team can use this as they wish.  This is the third publication of the CI build, so we have used 3.<br>
So, the latest CI build is version to 0.1.3. </p>
<p>You can always find the most updated information about the open JIRA ticket items we have left associated with the IG here: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=91986623">https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=91986623</a> or you can join our weekly public calls which are also located on the same page. We don't have much left. Here are the major items. </p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196361">@Ryan Howells</span> was iterate search functionality intentionally taken out of the IG or is it missing? I don't remember where we landed.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>For <em>after</em> the HL7 versioning convention change, you're absolutely correct.</p>
<p>Your original post was on 14 Aug, <em>before</em> the versioning convention change.<br>
As of 14 Aug, you'd be referring to</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>f339995 (tag: v0.3.1)
Sun Jul 26 16:45:32 2020 -0400
</code></pre></div>


<p>Which was the most recent release at that time.</p>
<p>This tag still exists, and will be confusing once the HL7 versioning convention catches up.<br>

<li>0.2.0 --&gt; 0.1.1   </li>
<li>0.3.0 --&gt; deleted this one completely, since the only difference between 0.3.0 and 0.3.1 were very minor</li>
<li>0.3.1 --&gt; 0.1.2</li>
