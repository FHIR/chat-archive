<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192132">@Amol Vyas</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="243554">@Pat Taylor</span>  Is it the intention of the EOB Pharmacy mapping to represent rejected claims?  </p>
<p>Rejected claims in the pharmacy world are different from rejected claims in the Medical world.  Medical claims are typically submitted after the service is completed; pharmacy claims are submitted before the medication is dispensed.  As a result, if a claim is rejected in the medical world, it represents something that happened to the patient, but the insurer decided not to pay for.  On the other hand, if a pharmacy claim is rejected, it represents a dispensing event that did not occur.</p>

<p>Jason, you ask a good question.  I'm verifying but at first glance, we don't receive rejected pharmacy claims.  And, to your point, the NCPDP reject code field, #511-FB is used when transactions cannot be completed.  Would you be willing to speak to this on the CARIN WG call Monday?  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196361">@Ryan Howells</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="238353">@Mark Roberts</span>  May this be added as an agenda item?  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192132">@Amol Vyas</span> are you ok if we clarify that pharmacy data does not include rejected transactions?</p>
