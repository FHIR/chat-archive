<p>The ExplanationOfBenefit 'supportingInfo:pointoforigin' slice has a required binding to the NUBC Point Of Origin code system: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/STU1/ValueSet-AHANUBCPointOfOriginForAdmissionOrVisit.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/STU1/ValueSet-AHANUBCPointOfOriginForAdmissionOrVisit.html</a>.  Specifically that value set definition specifies the 'FL 15 - Point of Origin for Admission or Visit'.  This code system contains duplicate codes for Newborn and Non-Newborn values.  </p>
<p>For Example, these 2 values use the same code: <br>
5 - TRANSFER FROM A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY (SNF), ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY (ALF), .. (NON-NEWBORN)<br>
5 - NEWBORN - BORN INSIDE THIS HOSPITAL (NEWBORN)</p>
<p>The IG only defines one system uri: <a href="https://www.nubc.org/CodeSystem/PointOfOrigin">https://www.nubc.org/CodeSystem/PointOfOrigin</a>, so how should we handle this when the codes are duplicate in this case?</p>

<p>I don't have access to the primary nubc documentation, but from what I turned up on google, it seems like if Admission Type (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/STU1/ValueSet-AHANUBCPriorityTypeOfAdmissionOrVisit.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/STU1/ValueSet-AHANUBCPriorityTypeOfAdmissionOrVisit.html</a>) is actually 2 code sets in one... If Admission Type is 4 (Newborn), then the newborn-specific codes are in effect for Point of Origin.  Otherwise the non-newborn code set is used.  </p>

<p>Right, but that still leaves conflicting codes in the  <a href="https://www.nubc.org/CodeSystem/PointOfOrigin">https://www.nubc.org/CodeSystem/PointOfOrigin</a> code system. We can't have two codings with a code of 5 in the same code system.</p>

<p>Right... I expect this will present a challenge for many platforms, but that's how I'm interpreting the spec as currently written.  It seems strange that nubc made the decision to overload codes in that code system.</p>

<p>Quoting the FHIR spec at <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#Coding">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#Coding</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If two codings have the same system, version and code then they have the same meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So 'supportingInfo:pointoforigin' is currently impossible to implement as specified since there are two different meanings for 5.</p>
<p>We need either a different system for the newborn-specific codes or a different code. Mangling the code to something like <code>5-newborn</code> is a terrible idea, using a different system seems like it is much more correct (they are even listed in different tables in the very useful PDF you posted).</p>
<p>Could we use something like <a href="https://www.nubc.org/CodeSystem/PointOfOrigin/Newborn">https://www.nubc.org/CodeSystem/PointOfOrigin/Newborn</a> for those codes?</p>
<p>It won't address any issues of data from a EOB feed/db being ambiguous, but would make it possible to express in FHIR.</p>

<p>I suppose we could make the 5 and 6 codes ambiguous themselves by combining the displays like "transfer from a snf/newborn born inside this hospital" then consuming systems would need to look at "supportingInfo:admtype.code" to determine what a 5 or 6 means.</p>

<p>Folks, stumbled onto this. When you have an issue like this reach out to the vocab community - we're here to help ;-). Since this is an external code system HTA is also on the field (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="195036">@Carol Macumber</span> .) Since I can't really see the content completely (thanks for the <a href="http://valueoptions.com/providers/Forms/Administrative/Tips_for_Completing_the_UB04.pdf">http://valueoptions.com/providers/Forms/Administrative/Tips_for_Completing_the_UB04.pdf</a> link!) I'm making some guess here but I think the right solution will be to recognize that the POA filed really uses two different code systems for exchange, based on if the patient is a newborn or not. NUBC (AHA) made an assumption that each field had only one code system and we assumed they were right, but you found out they were not in this case. Can you also tag the person that did the work on this IG? I'll tag <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191884">@MaryKay McDaniel</span> because she's always a help here...</p>

<p>Hi all,<br>
I'm really not trying to be dense or come across snippy, but I'm not following the ask or suggested fix. </p>
<p>I understand the issue = one 'value' has 2 definitions.  The code doesn't change, the definition of the code does. This is not the only code system/code set within the claims world to do this... The definition is based on more than 1 item. In this case:<br>
If the Priority (Type) of Admission = “4” (definition “Newborn”)<br>
Then a “5” in the Point of Origin for Admission or Visit description is “Born Inside This Hospital”<br>
Else  "5" =  Transfer from a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF)....</p>
<p>Not defending or condeming what we have - it is what we have and we work with it today.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I understand the question, "The IG only defines one system uri: <a href="https://www.nubc.org/CodeSystem/PointOfOrigin">https://www.nubc.org/CodeSystem/PointOfOrigin</a>, so how should we handle this when the codes are duplicate in this case?"  How do you handle it where? </p>
<p>And is the ask for the IG developers to create a 2nd value set from the original code system - one for newborn admissions and one separate? The code - "5" will be the same but because it comes from 2 separate value sets you could derive the definition? </p>
<p>Thanks for any clarity!<br>
MK</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Almost. Because there are distinct meanings for 5 and 6 there are actually two code systems for FL15 (one for newborn and one for nonnewborn). </p>
<p>So we would need a separate code system for newborn (only contains the 5 and 6 codes with their "born in hospital"/"born outside hospital" definitions). </p>
<p>To be super explicit without completely sharing the source file:<br>
<a href="https://www.nubc.org/CodeSystem/PointOfOrigin">https://www.nubc.org/CodeSystem/PointOfOrigin</a> would contain the 1-9 and A-Z non-newborn codes (5 = "transfer from SNF", 6= "transfer from another facility")<br>
<a href="https://www.nubc.org/CodeSystem/PointOfOrigin-Newborn">https://www.nubc.org/CodeSystem/PointOfOrigin-Newborn</a> would contain just 5="born inside this hospital" and 6="born outside this hospital"</p>
<p>The value set <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/ValueSet/AHANUBCPointOfOriginForAdmissionOrVisit">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/ValueSet/AHANUBCPointOfOriginForAdmissionOrVisit</a> would then contain all of the codes from both code systems.</p>

<p>As a consumer of the Fhir ExplanationOfBeneifit resource, when we read in the supportingInfo.pointoforigin codeable concept, how do we differientiate which NUBC code that the duplicate code (5) refers to?   Reading your explanation above, It sounds like we would need to also look at the supportingInfo.admittype codeable concept and do some logic that is specific to NUBC coding.</p>

<p>The CARIN team's recommendation is as follows.  A Jira ticket will be entered requesting the change.</p>
<p>-Define a new Codesystem: 'Point of Origin - Newborn' with the verbiage that ‘This code system consists of the following:  FL 15 - Point of Origin for Admission or Visit for Newborn and Non-newborn’</p>
<ul>
<li>Modify the PointOfOrigin Value Set in the Carin-BB IG to contain:<br>
       - all codes from the current 'Point of Origin' Code System<br>
       - all codes from the new 'Point of Origin - Newborn' Code System </li>
</ul>
<p>Constrain the combinations of Type Of Admission and PointOfOrigin by adding an invariant that:</p>
<p>- if 'Type of Admission' = 4, then the Code System of the value in the PointOfOrigin slice must be from 'PointOforigin-Newborn'<br>
  - if 'Type of Admission != 4, then the Code System of the value in the PointOfOrigin slice must be from 'PointOfOrigin'</p>
<p>As use of the NUBC codes and descriptions requires a license, implementers who wish to use the descriptions will populate their terminology servers accordingly.</p>

<a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30370">FHIR-30370</a> was written to add a new external code system define: 'Point of Origin - Newborn' in addition to the current code system and add an invariant that defines which should be used based on the Type of Admission.  </p>
<p>The HL7 Terminology Authority has defined a new code system, AHA-NUBC-PointOfOrigin-Newborn.  Additionally, to reduce confusion, the current code system, AHA-NUBC-PointOfOrigin was renamed to AHA-NUBC-PointOfOrigin-Nonnewborn.
