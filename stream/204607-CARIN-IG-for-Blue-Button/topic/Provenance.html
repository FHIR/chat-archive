<p>Is Provenance included in CPCDS? I did not see it in the IG and want to make sure inclusion is not implied.  - Jason</p>

<p>Our consumer-directed models never included Provenance. This is needed for consumers to understand where the data from multiple sources is originating from. This will be needed in all resources if we want to enable meaningful use (should be trivial to implement when consumer-directed, (it's static). </p>
<p>When you start exposing data from other sources from your patient access API things become a bit dicier. Regardless I see a need to include provenance in our resources.</p>
