<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192132">@Amol Vyas</span> At the connectathon we were given an opportunity to provide feedback on the IG. I wanted to open up a thread to capture this feedback. I am capturing this list from memory so anyone can feel free to include anything I missed or any new concerns. </p>
<p>1.)  It would be helpful to provide expanded text descriptions on the properties for CARIN resources. The FHIR spec allows for profiles to expand text descriptions without applying additional constraints. Most of the descriptions are inherited from either the US Core or the base resource descriptions and I think we are missing an opportunity to provide clarity and example values. This will be especially helpful for healthplans that may lack experience working with FHIR or HL7 specifications. </p>
<p>2.) It would be good to specify use cases for the various resources. This will help to highlight the business value that the resources can create. For example, we could specify that the Coverage resource can be used as a virtual member id card. Or that the Organization resource associated with Payor can contain customer service contact information regarding the insurance policy. It was suggested that healthplans work with their customer service departments to determine pain points so that we can capture additional high value use cases for these resources. </p>
<p>3.) It would be helpful to publish the CARIN profiles to <a href="http://Simplifier.net" target="_blank" title="http://Simplifier.net">Simplifier.net</a>. As of now the profiles are unclaimed on Simplifier. This will make the process of ingesting the profiles and performing validation easier in some cases.</p>

<p>For the "meat" of profiles on EOB, there's a long list of <code>supportingInfo</code> slices (see <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/StructureDefinition-CARIN-BB-ExplanationOfBenefit-Outpatient-Facility.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/StructureDefinition-CARIN-BB-ExplanationOfBenefit-Outpatient-Facility.html">here</a> for instance).

<li><em>patientDischargeStatusCode</em> has no documentation stating what this field means.</li>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span>  I agree that there should be descriptions of the slice definitions. If i am understanding your question, the name is confusing since patientDischargeStatusCode is not a code, the type is ExplanationOfBenefit.SupportingInfo. PatientDischargeStatusCode.value[x] supports boolean, string, quantity, attachment, and Reference(Resource).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think that what we are saying is that we will probably not have any use case that requires a contained resource but we may want to support included resouces based upon how the server is being queried. E.g. calling GET on patient/123 would not include the organization that is referenced but performing a search with the _include=organization param would include organization. I liked Paul's suggestion to support a PatientEverything with a _since param. This would include all related resources by default.</p>

<p>Can anyone confirm that the data elements that must be supported as per the CPCDS are represeted in the profiles with a minimum cardinality of "1.." with a "Must Support" value of true?

<p>In FHIR, these two modeling approaches (min cardinality "1..", vs Must Support=true) are used for two different purposes. "Must Support" might be used even for cases of optional elements (i.e. for things that aren't always present, but that a server must implement support for).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191912">@Michele Mottini</span> for context, at the connectathon some example data used contained resources and some clients found that problematic. In my opinion the use case was not suitable for contained resources; there was no particular reason they couldn't have been normal resources. We just need to make sure everyone is on the same page - there was some confusion over terminology.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I follow this. By definition (for FHIR), required means cardinality 1..x. I do not know the CPCDS requirements, but typically such requirements include things that can't be validated in an instance (e.g. an element may be required to be present if some condition that is outside the resource being validated is true)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span>  thanks for the input, I was referencing a comment by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> in the CARIN Benefit Check IG stream: <br>
"b) 1..1 and mustSupport are orthogonal. If something is 1..1 and not mustSupport, then nothing stops the sender from populating the element with a fixed value (or even a fixed extension that says something like 'not supported'). And on the receiving side, a mandatory element not marked as mustSupport is free to be ignored and thrown away. mustSupport is what sets conformance expectations that the system must be able to store/display/"allow user entry of"/"consider in decision support"/"do whatever with" the element. So typically if an element is 1..1 it will also be flagged as mustSupport."</p>

<p>any code systems we define do not require a commercial license -they have some kind of open source license.</p>
