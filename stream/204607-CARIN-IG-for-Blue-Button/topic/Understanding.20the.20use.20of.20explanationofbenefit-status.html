<p>The CARIN BB implementation guide requires that the status field be populated and that it use one of the 4 values from <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-explanationofbenefit-status.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-explanationofbenefit-status.html</a>.  I'm trying to get a better understanding of what these codes mean.  I see their descriptions but I'm not sure if my situation would ever call for using anything other than "active".  </p>
<p>It seems to me that this status isn't necessarily dependent on the data within the EOB itself but more of a general status for the resource.  For example, "draft".  Perhaps your system creates an EOB resource at some early stage of the adjudication process but that resource isn't really ready for primetime.  Perhaps it doesn't have all the required fields yet....</p>
<p>Why is it that EoB has this field but for example, the Patient resource doesn't have this?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can provide in advance.</p>

<p>Partial answer: Patient does not have a status in the base FHIR specifications, it has an <code>active</code> flag that has a similar function (but it is not required by Carin BB)</p>
