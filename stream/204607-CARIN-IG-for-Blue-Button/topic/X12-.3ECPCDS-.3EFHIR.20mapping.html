<p>Hi, I am also working on mapping 837 to FHIR, I am very interested why are you mapping 837 to EOB and not to Claim - do you have adjudicated 837 claims , is that the reason?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194124">@Varvara</span> : The CARIN Blue Button IG is about allowing consumers to access their adjudicated claims (aka EOBs) data at their Health Plans, through an app of their choice. To construct the complete EOB data model (present in both CPCDS data model and EOB FHIR profiles) from X12 transactions (instead of Facets or any other Health Plan claims adjudication system of record), I believe you'll also need the 277CA and 835 in addition to the 837.</p>

<p>This should in no way be viewed as official in any way and really should not be used. We continue to work with X12 to finalize an official mapping between X12 and FHIR. We're meeting with them in early November to finalize an MOU. Please reach out to us to learn more.</p>

<p>One of the reasons we want to sign the MOU is so CARIN and the HL7 community can have a more significant voice regarding how they should construct the mappings. Since the X12 IP is still proprietary, they will still be the only ones who can officially publish the X12 -&gt; FHIR mapping but our hope is we can influence that process in some way. We will ultimately point to the 'official' X12 mapping in our IG. </p>
<p>Keep in mind we're not mapping all of X12 to FHIR to start. We're going to begin with CARIN Blue Button and the 270/271 eligibility transactions and possibly move on to others. <a class="stream" data-stream-id="179283" href="/#narrow/stream/179283-DaVinci">#DaVinci</a> may have additional transactions they are looking at.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191808">@Wayne Kubick</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196361">@Ryan Howells</span> Hi everyone. I am also deeply curious on the relationship between CPCDS to FHIR mappings. And I just have a few questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is CPCDS -&gt; FHIR purely semantic, as in it just specifies what FHIR R4 fields to consume (EOB, etc)? </li>
<li>Or perhaps is it a FHIR Profile which adds fields and other features?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Sometimes FHIR Profiles add attributes. For example, the FHIR Profile known as US Core adds a new  field <code>birthSex</code> to Patient. Is there anything concerning CPCDS that does things like this to R4 resources? Does a CPCDS ExplainationOfBilling add any new fields, or define new extensions? Or is it just a semantic distinction.</p>
<p>I appreciate your response and clarification!</p>

<p>Even if it does not add extensions, a profile like this defines specific pieces of supporting information that must be present -- and the modeling of supporting Info is very similar to the modeling of extensions. So I don't have a sharp distinction like this in my mind.</p>

<p>But I'm still struggling with the fundamentals of your question -- CARIN is essentially creating a guide that explains how to convey a specific set of financial data in FHIR; a guide like this necessarily constrains FHIR resource definitions by locking down vocabularies and so forth. I don't know what you mean by "purely semantic" -- but if you mean something like "just another set of labels", then no, I don't think this captures what's going on. I guess the struggle for me is that "CPCDS" is not a pre-existing or independently defined set of content; so CARIN is not so much providing "a mapping of CPCDS into FHIR" as "defining FHIR profiles for a consumer financial use case."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I'm still struggling with the fundamentals of your question -- CARIN is essentially creating a guide that explains how to convey a specific set of financial data in FHIR; a guide like this necessarily constrains FHIR resource definitions by locking down vocabularies and so forth. I don't know what you mean by "purely semantic" -- but if you mean something like "just another set of labels", then no, I don't think this captures what's going on. I guess the struggle for me is that "CPCDS" is not a pre-existing or independently defined set of content; so CARIN is not so much providing "a mapping of CPCDS into FHIR" as "defining FHIR profiles for a consumer financial use case."</p>

<p>I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> . That is our intent.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196361">@Ryan Howells</span> Do you happen to have an updated mapping document that you would share? Would love if we could leverage this more broadly as well and put on the CPCDS IG itself!</p>

<p>Well, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="216373">@Christopher Marchand</span> I would love to say yes but the answer is no. X12 is a proprietary data set and we are respecting that by not publishing any guides online or in the IGs. We have reached out to X12 multiple times over the last few months to determine if they would be willing to work with us to publish a joint mapping but it hasn't yielded any meaningful progress despite their strong verbal desire to work with us. Your point is well taken. There is a strong interest in publishing something especially on the state Medicaid side. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191808">@Wayne Kubick</span> : Any ideas here? Do others have thoughts?</p>

<p>I haven't  heard any more from X12 either, and they are likely  backed  up since they had a recent ransomware attack.  I'll ask around.</p>
