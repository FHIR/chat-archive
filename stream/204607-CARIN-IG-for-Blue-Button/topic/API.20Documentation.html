<p>Question, as part of the final rule, under section § 422.119 Access to and exchange of health data and plan information, there is a requirements for the payer website to include documentation for accessing APIs. <br>
The rule specifies that the API documentation, including the following three items:</p>
<p>1)API syntax, function names,<br>
required and optional parameters<br>
supported and their data types, return<br>
variables and their types/structures,<br>
exceptions and exception handling<br>
methods and their returns;<br>
(2) The software components and<br>
configurations an application must use<br>
in order to successfully interact with the<br>
API and process its response(s); and<br>
(3) All applicable technical<br>
requirements and attributes necessary<br>
for an application to be registered with<br>
any authorization server(s) deployed in<br>
conjunction with the API.</p>
<p>Are there existing instructions for applications developers and/or technical requirements (other than referencing the IGs and FHIR standards themselves) that can be leveraged to satisfy this specific requirement? Any best practices or examples that can be leveraged here? Thanks much</p>
