<p>Hello, looking for some clarification on the Payee backbone element. My understand is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The types are: subscriber, provider, other; with beneficiary to be added (pending approval - <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-27008">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-27008</a>). </li>
<li>ExplanationOfBenefit.payee.party references C4BBOrganization, C4BBPatient, C4BBPractictioner. The details on ExplanationOfBenefit.payee.party says "need to provide demographics if the payee is not 'subscriber' nor 'provider'." It has 1.1 cardinality so there must be a resource referenced for each Payee. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is how we are modeling it:</p>
<ul>
<li>If type is "provider" then use C4BBOrganization or C4BBPractictioner</li>
<li>If type is "beneficiary" then use C4BBPatient</li>
<li>If type is "subscriber" then use C4BBPatient</li>
<li>If type is "other" then use ???. Can "other" be an organization or a person or both? If a person, is C4BBPatient the appropriate resource type? I saw that RelatedPerson was previously referenced by the CARIN IG but has since been dropped.</li>
</ul>
