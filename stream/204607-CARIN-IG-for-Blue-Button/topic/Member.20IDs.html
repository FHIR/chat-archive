<p>I recall discussing the member ID field a few ballot reconciliation calls ago: what the format should be and whether it even needing to be required...</p>
<p>Does anyone know what the outcome of that discussion was? As I recall, I'd mentioned that CMS had never offered the field in our API and it didn't seem to be a strong request from API users. I wasn't able to join the screenshare that day, though, so I'm unclear where things went from there.</p>
<p>Anyone know the ticket and/or outcome for this issue?</p>

<p>I think the discussion was in the context of including member IDs on EOBs?</p>
