<p>We have pulled together a list of comments for a block-vote-6 for the CARIN Consumer Directed Payer Data Exchange (CARIN IG for Blue Button®) IG ballot (2020-Feb-BLUEBUTTON R1 STU). You may withdraw any item from the block vote by responding to this email with the specific Key for the item you wish to withdraw or do so on the FM WG call prior to the vote.</p>
<p>We’d like to put the below up for block vote during the regularly scheduled Financial Management call on August 10. </p>
<p>I have attached a Word document, Excel spreadsheet, and a link to the comments in JIRA, which can be found <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/issues/?filter=12873&amp;jql=project%20%3D%20%22FHIR%20Specification%20Feedback%22%20AND%20Specification%20%3D%20%22US%20CARIN%20Blue%20Button%20(FHIR)%20%5BFHIR-us-carin-bb%5D%22%20and%20grouping%20%3D%20Block-Vote-6">here</a>.</p>
