<p>I have been researching the Formulary CoveragePlan CARIN IG and am stuck. We are a MA special needs plan with Part D. Many of our members have CMS Low Income Subsidy (extra help) that would help pay for drugs.  Where would I find the IG documentation to represent Low-Income Subsidy copay for Formulary Coverage Plan. Thank you in advance for your help!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="411178">@Kimberly Walker</span> I believe this question is regarding the Da Vinci Formulary IG as opposed to the CARIN BlueButton IG (which covers EoB data). <br>
I have posted the question here: <a href="#narrow/stream/197730-Da-Vinci.20PDex.20Drug.20Formulary/topic/Formulary.20Coverage.20Plan">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/197730-Da-Vinci.20PDex.20Drug.20Formulary/topic/Formulary.20Coverage.20Plan</a></p>
