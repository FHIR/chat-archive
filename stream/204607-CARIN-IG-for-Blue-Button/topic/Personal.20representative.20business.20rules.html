<p>We are getting a number of questions about how to handle the CMS requirement that requires access not only by the member but by the member's "personal representative" as defined by HIPAA. From the CMS rule, "Per the HIPAA privacy regulations at 45 CFR 164.502(g), a<br>
personal representative is someone authorized under state or other applicable law to act on behalf of the individual in making health care related decisions (such as a parent, guardian, or person with a medical power of attorney)". Also here: <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/2069/under-hipaa-when-can-a-family-member/index.html">https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/2069/under-hipaa-when-can-a-family-member/index.html</a></p>
<p>Question: Since SMART only supports one identity and not multiple, how would access be granted to a member's personal representative? Would the member need to request access and then delegate that access in the app to the member's personal representative or could access be granted to the member's personal representative via the member's credentials during the authorization process?</p>
<p>In addition, we're hearing payers have their business rules built into their portal related to minor access, 42 CFR Part 2 data, personal representatives, etc. That means they would have to duplicate or extract their business rules from their portal to handle API access via SMART. I'm curious how payers are handling these two topics and what solutions may be available that we can point payers to. Copying others who may have already solved for this. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191864">@Isaac Vetter</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191356">@Jenni Syed</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191404">@John Moehrke</span></p>

<p>In our system, the patient designates their authorized representatives today, and we track that. They will get sign ons that identify them, and during authentication our server looks up who they are authorized to access. They're presented an authorization screen that list all patients they're handing over data for to the app (if using "user/<em>" scopes) or to select from (for patient/</em> scopes). I showed some of these examples during the ONC Tech Forum also</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean when you say that "SMART only supports one identity" -- but the delegation question you are asking applies just as well to EHR systems today, since under hipaa, patients can delegate sharing decisions to an authorized representative.</p>

<p>As to "minors" - we handle the "aging out" as well as emancipation workflows automatically - the auth rep automatically loses access until the patient grants access again. In addition, for state law, we restrict what data the parent (for example) may have access to. Biggest example of this is sexual health data is typically protected for teens/within a certain age range.</p>

<p>And generally we have seen this kind of delegation happening outside of the portal environment -- but whether it happens through an automated portal interaction or whether it happens through a phone call, either way this is outside the scope of the SMART API. With SMART, some user who has access to data (e.g., a patient or guardian or authorized representative) he is able to share those data with an app.</p>

<p>I don't know what you mean by delegating access "in the app" <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196361">@Ryan Howells</span> ; this piece doesn't make sense to me, since the authorization protocol is upstream of what happens in the app.</p>

<p>If you're referring to the fhirUser reference in SMART - this is why we use "Person" for patient relationships when user scopes are involved - because it's not a Patient, and it's not a single RelatedPerson.</p>

<p>(<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191356">@Jenni Syed</span> I agree 100% with everything you've said here. As far as I am aware, CARIN's Blue Button IG is focused on patient level scopes and not users scopes.)</p>

<p>Honestly I don't think there is much to say about this in the blue button guide; this is not a unique problem about payer data, and for a CARIN blue button IG, it makes more sense to focus on the data profiles -- i.e. the pieces that are different from what the SMART App Launch IG covers. US Core is a good analogy.</p>

<p>Delegating access in the app meant after the authorization process has occurred with the data holder and the member has access to the data within their app, the member would then use functionality within the app to delegate access to another individual. In other words, personal representative access would happen outside of and after the initial member authorization event.</p>

<p>I agree  with Jenni. This is predominantly handled outside of the specific flows of SMART. There would need to be some patient driven ceremony where the delegated rights are captured (aka, authorization or consent depending on what terms of art you prefer). The Ceremony is either the OAuth authorization workflow does this binding of the delegate user to the patient delegated access; and/or a FHIR Consent Resource would hold this binding of the delegated user with the delegated rights given by the patient.  The workgroup focused on Consent has tried to get a set of people to work on this profile of Consent, but have not yet gotten interest in that profiling effort. We think that Consent can do this, and have some examples, but not a formal use-case analysis with implementation guide like instructions.</p>

<p>this tends to be an organizations internal concern, so is not important to have an interoperable specification for it. Either you have captured delegation authority, or you have not; driving authorization policy, or deny access. Exposing the policy is a nice theory, but not important to be in interoperable form.</p>

<p>Thanks all. This is helpful. We have let them know previously this would need to happen outside of SMART and the business rules need to be an internal payer's concern so it's nice to get that confirmation. I'm tagging a few payers to see if this helps answer their questions or to correct anything I may have misstated.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197108">@Jason Teeple</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192132">@Amol Vyas</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246928">@josh lamb</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260046">@Cille Kissel Watkins</span></p>

<p>Most of the payers currently receive authorization to disclose data through paper form (below is the link for a reference). Authorization is either all or only certain specific data segments. Authorization will also have expiration date. Challenge that we have is converting the information managed in paper into structured format for API 's to use for validation and build response with data segments that authorized. </p>

<p>Let's hope <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197261">@Bhanu Vemuri</span> that OCR comes out with guidance in the near future that says using the SMART OAuth process would qualify as being an acceptable method for getting a member's authorization rather than only accepting a member's written authorization.</p>

<p>Thanks for providing some perspective on the topic.  Payers  most likely have varying levels of sophistication on handling authorization and personal representatives.  Where there may be a perceived gap is around handling a personal representative in the JWT.  I agree that authorization is handled outside of the SMART pattern, my question is around communicating the personal representative and the in the "patient" in the JWT.  The use-cases I have seen and describe above by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191356">@Jenni Syed</span> all revolve around EHR patterns, not payers.</p>

<p>A payer can do the same thing an EHR does, can'it it? The personal representative log-in and then select the represented person as the one to return the data of - and the SMART flow returns the FHIR patient id of the represented person - ie I log in and then select my minor child</p>

<p>A payer can do the same thing an EHR does, can'it it? The personal representative log-in and then select the represented person as the one to return the data of - and the SMART flow returns the FHIR patient id of the represented person - ie I log in and then select my minor child</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends... <br>
Keeping in mind every Payer is different.  You are assuming a few concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is a process in place to receive the consent document and convert the value (assign person X personal rep for patient Y)</li>
<li>payers assign a new identity for the personal representative</li>
<li>the new personal rep identity is aligned to the patient identity</li>
<li>there is a log-in/presentation for selecting a represented patient<br>
While I can't speak for all payers, but based on conversations with some colleagues, I don't think the assumptions you are using are universal.</li>

<p>I agree that CARIN BB Profile should not solve the problem.  Though I think it is fair to point out that Payers cannot do the same thing as EHR vendors 100% of the time.  Without having the full background, was SMART developed with Payers and personal representatives in mind or primarily built for EHR concepts?</p>

<p>I don't understand. SMART has very little to say or do with personal representative (from EHR, payers or anywhere else) - the only thing it specifies is how to return a FHIR patient id to the client and permission scopes, that are very generic.<br>

<p>Maybe this is my disconnect without having a full background - how does SMART return the Patient ID AND the Personal Representative ID? All I am saying is that assuming there is a payer process in place to seamlessly link Patient and Personal Rep is a bad assumption. The payer process may be broken; just trying to relay the concerns I have heard.  Every Payer has a different process and it may not be automated or easily replicable.</p>

<p>The patient ID is part of the access token response (<code>patient</code> property). Apps can also request login information (via the <code>fhirUser</code> scope) and if granted, this information is shared as a <code>fhirUser</code> claim within the <code>id_token</code> property of the access token response. There's no explicit statement like "Person X is the personal representative of Person Y"; rather, we say to an app: "records for Person Y have been shared with your app; the user Person X is the one who shared them." Sometimes X==Y. The SMART protocol doesn't really care.</p>

<p>A document has been written using Personas and Patient Stories as a mechanism to describe how payers administer scenarios such as this.  How a payer handles personal representatives would be outside of the SMART authorization and authentication interaction.  </p>
<p>Other scenarios the document speaks to are:  <br>
·       Data payers send to the apps will be filtered in alignment with HIPAA and state requirements.  As these business rules (e.g, when a child reaches the age of majority, or court ordered restrictions) are applied as filters, the apps will not be aware of when the results may change.</p>
<p>·       Depending how a payer maintains a  member's data, the app may or may not continue to receive data when a patient changes lines of business (e.g., transitioning from QHP to MA).</p>
<p>·       The app will not receive CMS data from the payer if a patient moves between Medicare Advantage and CMS Medicare coverage.</p>
<p>The document is not exhaustive or intended to convey legal guidance.  However, it is a way to convey how data would be provided in various real life situations.  </p>

<p>Agree - i.e. we should be careful not to confuse existing (out-of-band) mechanisms that give someone power of attorney or a personal representative role, with the mechanisms for them (once having that authority) to then authorize an app, on their behalf, to access the data that they are responsible for.<br>
Also, the topic of what data a personal rep is authorized to see (and, hence, what data an app can be authorized to access on their behalf) is also a separate issue. Existing regulations, such as HIPAA and mental health laws, dictate this. I think the personas mentioned could be a good mechanism to provide examples of these nuances, if treated separately from any design assumptions about authentication, authorization, etc.</p>

<p>Sorry, don't see what's conflicting. The server  prompts Bill to select who to return the data about, he selects Ana, the app gets back Bill's token authorizing access to Ana data + Ana FHIR patient ID, app gets the data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I assumed based on previous explanation, Access token is granted to the individual patient as part of initial authorization. In the example above it is initially for Bill to see his data. Bill have to request "new" access token for Ana data. Sorry If I confuse you more with it. </p>
<p>My intent is to know at a high level, access token that granted is for an individual or all that user have consent (example above - Bill and Ana).</p>

<p>The token MUST grant access to the selected patient data (Ana in that example),  if the app requested a patient scope ideally it should grant access ONLY to that patient data, but a server is free to return a token with _more_ access than that (eg a token that can access both Bill and Ana data)</p>
