<p>We want to make you aware of the upcoming Da Vinci Education &amp; FHIR Implementation Event that will take place October 27-29. CARIN IG leads will participate in the event, however, a number of payers in the CARIN Community have indicated that they will not be able to attend the Implementation Event due to other obligations so it is unlikely that any client/server testing will take place for CARIN IG for Blue Button®. The CARIN track leads will hold an Information Session tomorrow October 22 at 11 am ET. Join the call here: <a href="https://leavittpartners.zoom.us/j/98146467716">https://leavittpartners.zoom.us/j/98146467716</a></p>
