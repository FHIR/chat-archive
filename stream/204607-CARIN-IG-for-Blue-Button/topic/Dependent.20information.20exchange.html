<p>Can someone provide guidance on, Do payers need to provide the ability to request data for minor children and spouse for whom user have consent ? CMS final rule do not cover any specific to this scenario. I heard some payers choose to allow patient can request only their own data to meet the mandate but not sure what the actual intent of CMS.</p>

<p>I think they do have to provide dependents data - otherwise if dependents cannot have their own separate login (as it would be the case for minors I guess)  there would be no way to get their data</p>

<p>Thanks Michele.  I hope it's not a choice for Payers to either support it or not. Choice does create variability with adoption. Most of the payers do provide dependent information on portals today. Unfortunately, I do not find any specific to it in the actual rule. Not sure did any pose this question to CMS for clarification.</p>

<p>The payer should provide the same information to the member who provides their portal UN/PW as they provide today via their member portal based on the payer's business rules that are managed behind their firewall. So if a payer has linked a member's dependents to a specific member's UN/PW via the payer's business rules, the member should be provided the option to retrieve their dependent(s) information via the API as long as it conforms to the SMART specification.</p>
