<p>Hello. I was hoping someone might help clear up some confusion for me. It seems like version v0.1.0 of the CARIN guide , it was acceptable to have EOB as its own profile that can be requested by consuming apps. Is that correct? It seems like the build version changes it so that it is an abstract profile that cannot be requested and only is used as a basis for other profiles. I just want to make sure that the intent of the EOB base profile changed and NOT that it was always intended to work as an abstract. Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Thank you <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246928">@josh lamb</span>  for your reply.  I think part of the confusion is the example provided for 0.1.0 seems to be for eob base and not for any of the other profiles.  Plus, the CARIN mapping PPT indicates that the EOB base could be its own profile. Moreover, if there isn't a generic profile, then how would dental claims get classified?   Would they come back on the professional profile?   Yet, the capability statement doesn't have it as a supporting profile so there seems to be a conflict.</p>

<p>Thanks again for the response.  It is much appreciated.  If the profiles are not ready, then wouldn't we need to use EOB base in order to provide data for dental and vision claims in time for 1/1 or would we need to use the professional profile in the meanwhile, in spite of the definition for that profile?  Also, if EOB base was never intended to be a profile that stands alone, then do you know why the guide has an  EOB base example?  Thank you.</p>

<p>As of the last time I asked, about a week ago, the intent is to incorporate the dental and vision profiles as part of the STU1 version of the IG. The regulatory deadline is 1/1 but enforcement will not begin until 6/1. If you needed to produce a Dental or Vison EOB outside of what is defined within the CARIN IG then you would just omit the CARIN profile on EOB.Meta.Profile.</p>

<p>Rakesh,</p>
<p>The Dental (Oral) and Vision profiles and mappings are slated to be part of STU2. Currently we are working with the sponsoring HL7 Financial Management WG to determine the timeline for the same (May or September ballot). Regardless, we plan on covering the draft versions of the same during the upcoming CARIN Connectathon in April. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="238353">@Mark Roberts</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191529">@Corey Spears</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="243554">@Pat Taylor</span></p>

<p>Any update to handle Dental claims as a Carin Profile?  Shall we go ahead and treat them as professional?  I see a new update to Carin June 16, 2021 but not seeing any dental.  An update on the status of dental claims would be great.</p>

<p>Are you part of the CARIN Alliance list serve. There was an announcement that this profile, which is part of STU2, will now be balloted during the January 2022 ballot cycle. It is still in development, but an advance copy of that work can be found here: <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/branches/STU2.0.0/">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/branches/STU2.0.0/</a></p>
