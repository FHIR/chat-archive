<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192132">@Amol Vyas</span> At the virtual connect-a-thon I asked some questions about the difference between total amounts and adjudicated amounts in the EoB. It wasn't clear to me how the data maps, as the mapping spreadsheet states that all amounts go into adjudicated, but then says something about total amounts being filled with totals also. I apologize if this is being handled somewhere, but I wasn't able to find anything in Jira related to it. Is this question still being researched or did I miss some explanation posted some place?</p>
