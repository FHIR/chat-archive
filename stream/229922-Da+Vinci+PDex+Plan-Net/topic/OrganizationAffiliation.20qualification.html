<p>There is a qualification extension in the <em>OrganizationAffiliation</em> profile. <br>
What could be a best example of the <em>OrganizationAffiliation</em> (relationships between two or more organizations) qualification (accreditation)?</p>

<p>The extension to add qualifications for an organization is there for the organization to list things like accreditations</p>

<p>That's fine when we are talking about an organization, but <em>"the OrganizationAffiliation resource describes relationships between two or more organizations"</em> . What qualifications in terms of accreditation are possible for the relationship?</p>
<p>Also, the qualification extension likely needs a qualification termination status, termination date and termination reason elements.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192195">@Shamil</span> Think of Organizational Affiliation to Organization the same as Practitioner Role to Practitioner.  It conveys information about the provider that is an organization just as information about a provider that is a person is conveyed in Practitioner Role. In this case, it can be used to convey qualifications that are specific to an organization provider but only for a specific component of that provider. </p>
<p>For example, a payer might contract with a hospital and under that contract is the acute care facility and an ambulatory surgical center. Both the acute care facility and the urgent care center have JCAHO accreditations. In this instance, there would be two Organizational Affiliation resources, one with the specialty for acute care hospital and the hospital's JCAHO accreditation and another with the specialty for ambulatory  surgical center and the JCAHO ambulatory health care accreditation.</p>

<p>Thank you Gail! <br>
I think this description is worth being added to the Plan-Net <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/StructureDefinition-plannet-OrganizationAffiliation.html">OrganizationAffiliation profile page</a> rather than being buried under other topics here.</p>
