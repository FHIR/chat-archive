<p>Folks,</p>
<p>I've been looking for guidance on using Locations to define a jurisdiction that I can use as a CoverageArea for an InsurancePlan. I haven't found much. Logically, I would assume that I can define a Location with just a state attribute for Insurance Plans that cover a single state. I can also define multiple Locations, each with a state and district, for Insurance Plans that cover counties with a state. </p>
<p>However, I've found that logic and specifications don't always mix. Is there some guidance or explicit definition of requirements for accomplishing this goal?</p>
<p>I'm also concerned that searching by district may not be supported. I can't find anything that clearly defines the supported chained search parameters  for an InsurancePlan.coverageArea (a Location).</p>
<p>Any help on this is appreciated ... Charlie</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="283867">@Charlie Filkins</span> ,<br>
See the examples in the IG.  This one does what you are trying do with a coverage area.<br>
<a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/InsurancePlan-AcmeQHPBronze.html">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/InsurancePlan-AcmeQHPBronze.html</a><br>
It uses both the address and an attached geoJSON to define the state of CT.</p>
<p>Searching by district isn't directly supported.  The closest that can be achieved in the current search interface is searching by a set of zipcodes.<br>
That would get you in the ballpark, and a client could filter it further using geographic filters.   We basically split the work between the server and the client intentionally in order to minimize initial server implementation burden.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="215604">@Saul Kravitz</span> Thanks for the quick response. I guess we've got some work to do here.</p>
