<p>Location, Organization and other entity profiles uses the <em>via-intermediary</em> extension in <em>.telecom</em> which has the Plan-Net <em>PractitionerRole</em> as one of the reference. </p>
<p>I'm trying to understand what is the logic to reference to, for example, "Specialized dentist" or "Dental medicine specialties" that such resource describes in terms of calling to a particular entity? I think the PractitionerRole has to be removed from the reference for this extension.</p>

<p>Shamil, the references to PractitionerRole are to support the occurrences where a provider has a particular role &amp;/or speciality for that location/organization/etc. The provider might have different contact information for different specialties or different organization affiliations.</p>

<p>Hi Sean, I've got your point. But each practitioner may have zero to many PractitionerRole each of which with its own .<em>telecom</em>.<br>
And thus, to know a contact info for a specific role, retrieve a related PractitionerRole for that Practitioner. <br>
This seems to be more intuitive rather than get a <em>Practitioner</em> first, then the <em>via-intermediary</em> extension, then the <em>PractitionerRole</em>, and only then the phone number. Is it not?</p>
