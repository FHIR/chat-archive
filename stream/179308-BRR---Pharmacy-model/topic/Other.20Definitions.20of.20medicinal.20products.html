<p>We have a few resources to convey "the relevant characteristics of a medicinal product". <br>
Some resources for the top regulators, some resources for the clinical world. <br>
Some resources aligned to IDMP, others not focused on that.</p>
<p>Out there, we will have variance. How is FHIR going to support it?</p>
<p>how do we support the several levels/concepts of medication? For one country, the top level is "generic" but for another it will be "active substance".</p>
<ul>
<li>RxNorm has 2 levels IIRC</li>
<li>IDMP has several levels (4 concepts, but one of them has several levels)</li>
<li>DCI / ICD has not levels, but just substances (and is still a target for national prescription)</li>
<li>Countries have levels of granularity that can be Generic , Brand , Package, etc. this is not a small set. <br>
They are all useful.</li>
</ul>

<p>in Open Medicine, we could (only?) solve the issue by having a "master medicinal product attribute set" from which we could select a couple of attributes to define a Pharmaceutical Product, or a substance, or a branded product... This avoided some ideas to prevent proliferation of concepts.</p>

<p>I personally am inclined towards a "master" definitional resource that can be profiled, rather than several resources with specific purposes. <br>
This could include regulatory needs (e.g. a Pharmaceutical Product is a Medication Definition for which Substance, Strength, Dose Form... are present, medicinal Product is one where Manufacturer, brand... are present."</p>

<p>I know this will get interesting when looking at medicinal products that have two pharmaceutical products (e.g. oral contraceptives, or packages that have different types of antibiotics for a given schedule) but i just wanted to launch the need:<br>
IDMP is one of the great things that happened in this topic, and we must support it, and provide a bridge to all the other "medicinal product definitions" that exist in local regulatory jurisdictions, or inside a given hospital, or inside the context of a given insurance plan...</p>

<p>Quoting <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191337">@Dion McMurtrie</span> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've thought about this quite a bit too <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> and it does seem a bit awkward at present. It seems FHIR currently has 3 concepts of medications -<br>
* Medication - used for instance resources in prescribe/dispense...etc events<br>
* MedicationKnowledge - used to provide reference and definitional information about medicines, e.g. from terminology<br>
* "Medication Definition" resources - appear to be a FHIR rendering of IDMP</p>
<p>I've spent time working on STU3 representing terminology definitions using Medication because I started before MedicationKnowledge existed. For my use case there were many required extensions to Medication to support what I wanted to do. You can see the latest results at <a href="https://medserve.online" target="_blank" title="https://medserve.online">https://medserve.online</a></p>
<p>Perhaps moving to MedicationKnowledge will resolve some of these extensions (I'm yet to do that analysis), but both Medication and MedicationKnowledge have this strange (to me) modelling with respect to "units" (like a tablet) versus packages (like a bottle of tablets) and the resulting consequence of being able to represent nonsense.</p>
<p>The "Medication Definition" resources are much more detailed in their modelling, separating out this concept clearly, but are also much more detailed than the use case I've got - I want to provide AMT and other medicines terminology content via an easy to consume API, and FHIR makes a pretty good candidate for this.</p>
<p>So I'm really interested where this goes, but I agree something that is probably more maximal than MedicationKnowledge (maybe split it in two first) and then profiled for various use cases makes sense...but that's just my thought.</p>
<p>I'd be interested to sit in on that discussion if possible...</p>

<p>Re this idea <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span>  "I personally am inclined towards a "master" definitional resource that can be profiled, rather than several resources with specific purposes."</p>
<p>The issue with this is that by far the most commonly used subset as used in the Medication resource is very much smaller than the full set of data items. </p>
<p>We have, more or less, ruled out the idea of using an actual FHIR profile of some all encompassing SuperMedication for what the the day to day Medication resource is used for now. Done that way, everyone would need to use a profile of a huge resource, when only a small percentage users actually care about the other 90%. </p>
<p>Even as someone coming at this from a regulatory point of view, I feel that this puts the burden in the wrong place. </p>
<p>Having a profiled set of resources has some elegance in engineering terms but would make it hard for implementers. The commonly used things need to be as easy as possible to use.</p>
<p>Instead, the current thinking is to have a logical supserset model (not directly implementable) and do "logical profiles" of it, into Medication, MedicationKnowledge, and MedicinalProduct and the other "definitional" resources. </p>
<p>There will be overlap in physical terms, but this is mitigated by the logical model that documents this, and shows what belongs where. We do plan to refactor as much as possible so that there is little physical overlap between the MedicationKnowledge and MedicinalProduct resources.</p>
<p>There is perhaps some scope for other parts of the models to be collapsed together however, possibly for instance MedicinalProduct and MedicinalProductPharmaceutical.</p>

<p>It seems I missed a key point: <br>
The "master definitional" would be definitional, so including PhP, MP, MedicationKnowledge... but not taking the role of the medication resource used in prescriptions, etc. - which is much smaller indeed.</p>

<p>So maybe that is the key thing yes, it won't be a FHIR resource, just a UML model to explain how things fit together. So it won't be "profiled" in literal FHIR terms. But the effect will be similar.</p>

<p>better example for medication/Definition boundary: openMedicine. Across borders, you cannot point to a medication because a common code does not exist. But you can send all the characteristics you know and those will be used on the other side. In that case, it is a medication / definition thing.<br>
(i know IDMP will solve all that, but this use case will stil exist, and we are taking advantage of the best of IDMP: A logical model with clearly defined elements.</p>

<p>I see Medication and MedicinalProduct (I think this is what you are calling MedicationDefinition) as somewhat like child and parent. Basic version and full version. (MedicinalProduct is really a set of resources "MedicinalProductEtc" however). MedicationKnowledge is perhaps more of a sibling of Medication, since it is a different set of information items, rather than more detail. But it's not that clear cut of course, and some of MK is in MPEtc (but some is not).</p>

<p>my main point is that I don't see how many resources we will have for the definition bit:<br>
a) we have One single FHIR core resource, of which MP (regulatory), PHP (Regulatory), MK(drug databases), and other custom flavors, like US RxNorm concepts, and other national stuff like NationalProductDefinition, HospitalCodeDefinition, GenericPRoduct,... are profiles. We'd have one resource or pattern, and several profiles.<br>
b) we have one resource for PharmProduct, one for MedProduct, one for PackagedPRoduct(IDMP), one for NationalPackageConcept, one for "National Code"... where will it end?</p>

<p>That is what I suggested to align. I think the name "knowledge" is misleading, and I do know that there is no single way to define a product. Even inside a hospital there will be many medication concepts that need to be defined. Some regulatory, some logistic, some scientific.</p>

<p>Well we do aim to cover that request. Let me know if you see that the current thinking does not fit with that.  </p>
<p>There will definitely be some challenges with what to call things, that is inevitable and ultimately unavoidable. But good discussion and good documentation should mean we can land on names that work. </p>
<p>Why would contraindication not be a resource? it is a repeatable reusable chunk. You may want to add one to a product that already exists (possibly in some other repository or code system), hence it needs its own lifecycle. It may be about a Medication or a MedicinalProduct, or be part of MedicationKnowledge, or some other treatment, so that also points to something that is separate.

<p>contraindication seems to be an attributed relation between a product and a condition (or something else). While it makes it interesting, I'm not sure this makes it a viable candidate for resource (but I can't really point at a clear reason, sorry).</p>

<p>In my opinion, this is not a valid conclusion. when we add a contraindication to a medication you are not altering the lifecycle of a medication, you are altering the actual medicinal product characteristics as they should be seen by whoever uses it. So it points at a characteristic of a product.</p>

<p>In fact, contraindications can be about any level of granularity of product.<br>
This example is clearer and while I don't think a contraindication is a separately governed entity, i see why you are thinking of something that can be reused in several places.<br>
But if the medication or medicinalProduct or ... are the same resource, the first half of the problem no longer exists - a contraindication can be a characteristic of a product, regardless of the level and type of the product.</p>

<p>I think there is one problem that is still not solved - a way to support non-IDMP regulated product definitions. Making one resource for each level is OK if we have 4  to 7 levels like IDMP, but will still need to be used in practice.</p>
<p>I think medicationKnowledge is closer to that and it reflects most of my ideas, so I am in favour of one MedicineDefinition resource or logical model, that contains information about:<br>
. What level of granularity it is (PhP, MP, PCP, Generic, HospitalCode, RxNorm,...)<br>
. A link to a base definition (what is the "parent" level product)<br>
. The identifying attributes of all the IDMP levels. Substance, Strength, Package Size, etc. (<a href="http://www.open-medicine.eu/fileadmin/openmed/re_documents/openmedicine_deliverable_3.2_v1b_fin_after_atr.pdf#page=29" target="_blank" title="http://www.open-medicine.eu/fileadmin/openmed/re_documents/openmedicine_deliverable_3.2_v1b_fin_after_atr.pdf#page=29">http://www.open-medicine.eu/fileadmin/openmed/re_documents/openmedicine_deliverable_3.2_v1b_fin_after_atr.pdf#page=29</a>)<br>
. Standard extensions (if it is a resource) or core optional attributes (if it is a mode) for all the necessary IDMP regulatory stuff, and them some.<br>
. Profiles (of resource) or </p>
<p>How to use: <br>
If we want to define a PHP, we have one resource with Substance, route, etc filled in. No MAH, no package<br>
If we want to define a MP, we have another resource that points to the PhP(s), and then we fill the rest of the stuff: MAH, Brand Name...<br>
If we want to define any another granularity level, we pick their characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>a US NDC can point to the RxNorm(?) parent and provide the brand name and manufacturer...</li>
<li>A European "Hospital Code" or "national dispense code" links to the PhP, adds package size '''without''' specifying the manufacturer.<br>
..</li>
</ul>

<p>hi Jose, we still have the basic issue that the most commonly used entity - Medication - should not be a profile of a much larger thing that is not of interest to most users.

<p>Ah, the way I see it, you do want to update the product definition. Not the "regulatory" product definition, but if you say "as of now I am stating that this may interact with that", you are defining a product characteristic</p>

<p>So concretely if a product is defined as having a contraindication on the regulatory side, when the hospital defines their own flavour of the product they would use the same resource type but trim down some of the attributes and create a new resource instance. And conversely if that internal redefinition means that a new granularity is defined and the new code is justified then they have this new instance of the same resource type but with other code</p>

<p>Remember that MedicationKnowledge, despite the name, was never intended to be the source of all knowledge of the product. It has a different scope. It's not intended to be huge model that can polymorphically represent all levels of products. Think of it as "MedicationPrescribingSupportData", or something. Yes we need something somewhere that has that it all, but let's not reuse the current definitions. I see this big model as a logical model, only, with concrete expressions that are cut to best match how users would like to use them, and in chunks that are palatable in size and ability to be comprehended. We don't want common product model back again :-)</p>

<p>The determination of use cases is the task that FMG has put forward to us - Pharmacy and BRR - to determine.  We obviously have implementer need for the current Medication resource and for the IDMP work that Rik is doing.  What we haven't had is a solid implementer requirement for any other use case.  Scott Robertson and I are heading to NCPDP next week to get some support for our current MK resource use case from the participants there and there has been some other work in Baltimore to find implementers who need what MK is proposing to provide.  If there are other implementer needs/use cases that call for other representations, we need to find those out and determine what they need.</p>

<p>Hi Jose. Help me understand this strong statement that all levels must be in one resource type.</p>
<p>I wonder if your statement comes from the requirement that we want to be able to <em>prescribe</em> at all levels? i.e. have one slot that can carry a code (or reference) to any of the levels. </p>
<p>That doesn't mean that you need the definition of a pack to be conflated with the definition of a product, only that you can point at either. </p>
<p>In the UK we can prescribe a pack or a product (manufactured by someone) or a pharmaceutical product (just the "drug"). </p>
<p>You can use the code for any, but behind the scenes these have different properties.</p>
<p>People who support different levels in the definition will want to track the parts differently. EMA certainly do.</p>
<p>They want a list of packs (that make up products) to be different from a list of products.</p>

<p>Hi Rik. Perhaps it seems as such, i don't say it must be a single resource type. I think it should, becauseI don't see another way to have the flexibility I really think is needed. And perhaps my perspective is not clear, so i can try to explain better</p>

<p>From an 'outside perspective' it seems like the differences you are talking about is between a 'data model' and an 'workflow model' (or dynamic/interaction model).    It appears that in order to come to an agreement on the 'data model' there needs to be an understanding of the 'workflow model' to discover what is needed in it.    It would be very helpful if there were a set of workflow models (like the IHE Hospital Pharmacy profile) to help have some concrete use cases to 'test' this 'data model' against.    (To my 'newbie eyes' the IDMP levels seem to be about granularity or specificity of the data model but still do not address the workflow model.)</p>

<p>I think that is the (only good) solution, yes. In my implementation, this was indeed the first thing we established to make the problem solvable - different concepts of product with different characteristics. There is a list of substances a list of packages, the list of "inventory items", all those were independent. our hospital catalog then just articulated all of those.</p>

<p>So, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191651">@Rik Smithies</span> I think the only difference between what you are presenting and I am presenting seems to be this:<br>
PhP, packs, products have a well-defined set of characteristics. So you can conceive three resource types for this, each having their characteristics. then you can share information about those products.<br>
But the moment that you have something that contains a combination of characteristics from more than one level (the "official hospital product code" that is common in South Europe and is basically PhP + Pack size), I don't see how we would handle that - we send the PhP characteristics in a PhP resource and then an extension with the pack size? Or another solution I am not seeing atm? This is a simple example of why we must use IDMP as a reference but there are other definitions of products that do not match IDMP.<br>
So I am orbiting to a solution that is one resource type, that, depending on what attributes are populated, can inform of a PhP, or a Pack, or a MP, or a "generic" or a "CIP" or whichever of the many levels are needed.</p>

<p>hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> , that's great. Thanks. That is just what we need. </p>
<p>Real uses cases that we can try to fit into the models and see if they work, and make changes if not. This is much better than working in the abstract. </p>
<p>Is this one coded item (for the predefined combination of pharmaceutical and pack), or two (with a second code or number for the pack size)?</p>
<p>Assuming the former, isn't that just a product? Perhaps you would call it a virtual one.</p>
<p>But a predefined combination of a drug and a pack size seems to me to fit fine into MedicinalProduct.</p>
<p>Sure it's not like the full use of IDMP where you have names and manufacturers etc, but that's no problem. None of that is mandatory.</p>

<p>When this discussion starts talking about products and packaging it got me thinking that the (US) NDC codes do exactly that.  Although your discussion has been about IDMP shouldn't the MedicinalProduct also consider NDC as well?   The 3 segments of the NDC identify:  the labeler, the product ,the commercial package size.</p>

<p>That is right, but sometimes that is just how FHIR works. Data is split across resources. You often need more than one resource to represent complex things. If you really need one resource instance you can use contained resources. The data needs to be split for some use cases. It can easily be joined back together for other use cases, that is normal for FHIR. But you cannot easily split something that is too coarse grained. As well as the various MedicinalProduct series of resources, you may have DocumentReferences, Organizations etc. It cannot all be in one resource.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194183">@John Silva</span>  Yes the MedicinalProduct certainly should consider NDC - as well as all similar international systems. It is no way meant to be limited to IDMP, it's just that that ISO standard has been developed specifically to cover a large subset of this sort of data (albeit coming at this from the angle of the regulators rather than the prescribing drug catalogues). The resources do have places for the labeller (I assume this is manufacturer, but let me know if not), the product, and the pack size.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contained in what? which resource would you use</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contained in MedicinalProduct.</p>
<p>MedicinalProduct is not synonymous with an IDMP medicinal product. Just because it is inspired by IDMP it isn't meant to only cover things that are exactly like IDMP - at all.  That is just one of the data sets that it aims to cover. It covers things that are "products". </p>
<p>That is something that is prescribe-able, but is more than just a pharmaceutical or a substance. (A counter example might be "give 20mg morphine" - really just an active substance). A product is either something listed by a manufacturer, or something that is a "virtual" product, a combination that is a pharmaceutical and a pack size perhaps. It's a bit of a subtle definition but you know one when you see one :-) Your thing, if it is given a code and it is not just a pharmaceutical/substance/ingredient, is a product.</p>
<blockquote>
