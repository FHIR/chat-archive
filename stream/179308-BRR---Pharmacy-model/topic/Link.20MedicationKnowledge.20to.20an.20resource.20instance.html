<p>The "subject" of a MedicationKnowledge is MedicationKnowledge.code. </p>
<p>This is a logical reference, perhaps to a (non-FHIR) code system (e.g. RxNorm or SNOMED etc). </p>
<p>I assume this can be used to link to a Medication resource, which has the same code. I think there is practical value in linking to an actual FHIR Medication instance (or a MedicinalProductDefinition instance). That's the normal way to link in FHIR, when the data is available in FHIR.</p>
<p>So I suggest changing  MedicationKnowledge.code to be a CodeableReference(Medication|MedicinalProductDefinition). Then it can be used to add "knowledge" - prices, protocols etc etc to any FHIR medication.</p>
<p>Also, and this is independent, we could consider changing the name of "code" to "subject" to show that this is information about another medication (wherever that may be, FHIR or otherwise), and not the code of the actual knowledge, which is how it can be read now.</p>

<p>sorry, thanks, that was meant to say MedicinalProductDefinition, now corrected :-) </p>
<p>I would ask why we would not want to link the knowledge to the medication? That is what we do now, but by code. The Medication can be a definition, and the MedicinalProductDefinition is (more obviously) a definition.</p>

<p>hi Jose <br>
There are use cases where you want to define a product and you want to say about the package and the shape of the tablet, and also its kinetics and price. That needs both MedicinalProductDefinition and MedicationKnowledge, but there is no way to join them. Other than by code. Code is not precise enough, because you don't know if it points to the code in the code system itself, or to some resource that happens to use that code. If this is not needed for Medication (which, in my view, can be definitional - it states that in its description in fact), then maybe not, but it is needed for MedicinalProductDefinition.</p>

<p>ah I see yes. Well that could be extended to allow reference to MedicinalProductDefinition. But I see that as similar to the"code". Maybe better to collapse into a CodeableReference, which seems the preferred pattern to link things that may be codes or instances</p>

<p>no we don't.  Medication is not a "definitional" resource.  it is an identifying resource of something that was ordered, dispensed, or administered.</p>
<p>and the scope for these three resources is quite well-defined in their proposals.  it just needs to get conveyed in the spec itself.</p>

<p>Pharma company creates a new medication product.  They need to submit their product reference information to a registrar such as the EMA or the FDA.  They use MedicinalProductDefinition as their resource as this contains all of the reference information that a registrar needs to evaluate, register, and authorize medication products.</p>
<p>The product is now on the market and a drug knowledgebase such as Medi-Span or First Data Bank includes it in their product.

<p>1) That question was settled by the FMG.  I do not think any group wants to revisit that question.<br>
2) Strangely enough, the regulators in different countries have been working together and created the IDMP specifications which is what MedicinalProductDefinition is based on.  We have active work being done on investigating implementation of these resources by the FDA and the EMA, so that should drive out all of the requirements.</p>

<p>To point it back at you, we've had this conversation before and finally nailed it down and all groups are now trying to move forward and get something that can be implemented and tested.  I'm pretty sure that you were involved in those discussions.  That is why your questioning seems counter-productive to us.  We don't want to go backwards when all groups (BR&amp;R, Pharmacy, and FMG) have agreed on a path forward.  This is quite new ground for the Pharma community so it might be that, once we get actual implementers involved in all of these resources, that some coalescing might occur.  But we haven't seen that yet and we do seem to have three different implementer communities (as I expressed earlier in my scope examples) that don't actually share information between them as much someone would think.</p>

<p>Ok, then please move forward. I maintain my concerns. I was partially involved shortly after I proposed such a topic in Orlando (it was rejected at first), and my input has been documented and has not changed much since. <br>
I truly am sorry if you see this as counter-productive, but my questioning remains the same as from the time of openMedicine, where we explored these requirements. This is why I eventually stopped being involved. Perhaps we need another project like openMedicine. :)</p>

<p>oh yes so that associatedMedication link to Medication is not a subject, that I am looking for, so that is a different issue. It's another related medication (could do with a "type" for the link maybe). </p>
<p>The link to MedicinalProductDefinition would not be that but would be like the code. Those two seem conceptually the same. That could usefully have Medication there too I would say, but if that isn't wanted then I don't have that use case. </p>
<p>Medication  can be definitional I think - it says that in the very first line of its page. You could set up a load of medications and point a series of prescriptions at them. You don't need one per script. But if people aren't going there then no problem.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192166">@Jean Duteau</span> Is the associatedMedication intended to be the medication that the knowledge is about? I see the definition has changed, substantially. Maybe it was never meant to be as it was documented, but the new definition looks like it is the "subject" of the knowledge?</p>

<p>no, it is intended to be Medication resources that represent the medication that the MedicationKnowledge is about.  it points to resources that can be used in the other resources.</p>

<p>to be honest, i'm not convinced we need this attribute.  I really don't think there will be an actual link between the three resources.  In all of the prescribing and dispensing systems I've seen so far, they are all using the medicationCodeableConcept or using a contained Medication for compounds.  No one yet is actually referencing an external Medication resource.</p>

<p>so it is Medication instantiations of the definitional medication (somewhere) that this knowledge is about. I cant see any need for that, because the Medication resources themselves have that, via Medication.code.</p>

<p>Is it the case that the MK is about a coded item (not in FHIR) and the Medication is an instance of the same coded item (not in  FHIR) but the MK is not about the Medication itself. There is pointer from MK to M, but its not an "about" relationship it's a "these two things are based on the same definition" link.</p>

<p>I can add one for the reference yes. But I am thinking that the logical thing is to treat the code (pointer to an external definition) and the new reference to a MPD (pointer to an internal definition) as the same concept, namely the "subject". You could have a choice of code or reference to MPD but then it doesn't make sense to still call it "code".</p>

<p>With my excuses for missing the discussions (i don't know where those are), <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191651">@Rik Smithies</span> you added an ingredient.function.<br>
But is the function of an ingredient an intrinsic characteristic of the ingredient? I think it is a characteristic of the product it is used in. Which means I don't see how this will be managed in real life - if an ingredient can have two different functions in two different products, you think we should have 2 instances of the Ingredient resource?</p>

<p>Hi Jose. Discussions are on the weekly BR&amp;R calls, where we review the Jira change requests. I will try to copy them to here though in future. This one was raised by FDA. <br>
Yes the function of an ingredient is an intrinsic characteristic of an ingredient, because a FHIR ingredient is always in the context of a product (or at least some other thing that it is a part of). Otherwise it would be little more than a substance. <br>
Ingredients have strength, and this naturally is in the context of its use in something else - no ingredient truly has a strength in and of itself. The function is in the context of the same thing. <br>
If an ingredient has two different functions in two different products then yes that would be two ingredients. If it had a different strength in those two products then it would already be two different ingredient resources. The same substance can be an excipient or an active ingredient, and again that would be two different ingredients.</p>

<p>Ok that is clear. Taking your starting point (that this is complex enough to deserve a bunch of different resources) then this makes sense.<br>
