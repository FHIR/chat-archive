<p>How frequently does Inferno CE pick up test updates from BDT? </p>
<p>I have been testing our APIs with BDT directly, I  know BDT has also changed a bit during the past month or so in terms of configuration support and even some of the tests have been modified  that don't seem to be in CE...</p>

<p>I know we are currently a few versions behind right now.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191506">@Yunwei Wang</span> was looking at closing the gap at the last connectathon -- did we get those changes in Yunwei?</p>
