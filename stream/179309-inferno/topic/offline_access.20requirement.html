<p>In Inferno, test for Limited Access, the description states: "This scenario demonstrates the ability to perform a Patient Standalone Launch to a SMART on FHIR confidential client with limited access granted to the app based on user input. The tester is expected to grant the application access to a subset of desired resource types, and to deny requests for “offline_access” refresh tokens."</p>

<p>I know the ONC requirements do require us to show the user/allow the user to enable offline access for an application. It also requires us to provide a management endpoint to revoke it later. However, I didn't believe there was a requirement to remove the scope for offline_access. There <em>are</em> requirements to revoke "resource level" access scopes, but these are different</p>

<p>There is this section in the preamble of the Final Rule (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/p-1254">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “permission-offline” “SMART on FHIR Core Capability” includes support for the “offline_access” scope. Importantly, the implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(a)(3) requires that patients have the ability to explicitly enable the “offline_access” scope during authorization. If the “offline_access” scope is not enabled by patients, patients will be required to re-authenticate and re-authorize an application's access to their EHI after the application's access token expires.</p>

<p>Correct, we definitely describe to the user when the app is requiring offline access so that they realize they're enabling it. And we allow them to revoke later via the required ONC management endpoint. "Enabling" offline access when an app doesn't ask for it seems odd. And they can fully decline the access if needed (giving an app access for 15 minutes only when they wanted offline isn't going to be very functional - at this point the patient is just declining the access).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Enabling" offline access when an app doesn't ask for it seems odd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree, that would be odd, because an app that didn't ask for offline_access probably wouldn't know what to do with a refresh token if given one.</p>
<p>But I think the intent is here is to give the user power to deny offline_access for apps that ask at the time of authorization, not to give the user the power to enable offline_access for apps that don't ask.  Thus we are interpreting it from a test perspective as "if an app asks for offline access, the user gets the choice whether to enable offline access or not.  If they choose to not enable offline access, then the app will get access but only until the access token expires (in your case, 15 minutes), after which point the app will have to be reauthorized"</p>
<p>I think I understand your approach, which is slightly different.  Instead of allowing the user to deny just the "offline_access" scope, thus allowing temporary (15 minute) access to their clinical data, you instead inform the user that the app will receive "offline_access" if authorized but give no ability to deny just the "offline_access" scope. The user can choose to not authorize the app at all, or authorize it with offline_access scope.  If they choose to authorize the app, the user is free to revoke the refresh token whenever they like -- if they did it in 15 minutes it would have the exact same effect as not being given a refresh token at all.</p>
<p>Is my description of your approach accurate?</p>

<p>If the “offline_access” scope is not enabled by patients, patients will be required to re-authenticate and re-authorize an application's access to their EHI after the application's access token expires.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>While it's not optimal, the <em>reason</em> the workflow is degrading is because the patient made a choice not to allow offline access. What is the alternative? If you just deny the app access and redirect back, how will the app know specifically what the problem was? In theory we could define some interoperable way to say the reason for the denial was this specific scope and the app could retry, but we don't have anything like that today (do we?)</p>
<p>In the current workflow, the best practice for apps is to ask for what you need, and be prepared to deal with what you get, degrading gracefully when you can. Wanting longterm access but having the patient decide to only grant 15 minute access is still pretty darn good for a lot of apps</p>

<p>Yes, and I agree about handling degraded experiences. But for apps that may hand these off to servers they may not have a great option in this use case. Also, we've seen that apps don't handle degraded experiences  today :)</p>

<p>Yes. Do you read that language differently?  Maybe if I look hard for a loophole based on precisely what is written there, I could argue that it technically allows you to provide a refresh token if the patient denies offline access, as long as that refresh token cannot extend the life of the access token.  So you can hand out a refresh token, but you can't use it to refresh a token.  Is there any value in that?</p>

<p>Inferno's ONC certification tests might actually allow that loophole today, given how we constructed tests.  It wasn't our intent though.</p>

<p>Hey folks. Just catching up here. Just to be clear, the language referenced above is in a response to a comment, not the rule itself. The comment response says: "Importantly, the implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(a)(3) requires that patients have the ability to explicitly enable the “offline_access” scope during authorization."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/03/04/2019-02224/21st-century-cures-act-interoperability-information-blocking-and-the-onc-health-it-certification#sectno-citation-%E2%80%89170.215">§ 170.215(a)(3)</a> is actually just referring to the SMART App Launch Guide, not any specific language from the rule. So this seems like a very specific interpretation of the SMART App Launch guide that may be in error. In other words, I don't see this "requirement" anywhere in the guide: "that patients have the ability to explicitly enable the “offline_access” scope during authorization."</p>

<p>This is the relevant language from the SMART App Launch Guide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Refresh tokens are issued to enable sessions to last longer than the validity period of an access token. The app can use the expires_in field from the token response (see step 3) to determine when its access token will expire. EHR implementers are also encouraged to consider using the OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection Protocol to provide an introspection endpoint that clients can use to examine the validity and meaning of tokens. An app with “online access” can continue to get new access tokens as long as the end-user remains online. Apps with “offline access” can continue to get new access tokens without the user being interactively engaged for cases where an application should have long-term access extending beyond the time when a user is still interacting with the client.</p>
<p>The app requests a refresh token in its authorization request via the online_access or offline_access scope (see SMART on FHIR Access Scopes for details). A server can decide which client types (public or confidential) are eligible for offline access and able to receive a refresh token. If granted, the EHR supplies a refresh_token in the token response. After an access token expires, the app requests a new access token by providing its refresh token to the EHR’s token endpoint. An HTTP POST transaction is made to the EHR authorization server’s token URL, with content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded. The decision about how long the refresh token lasts is determined by a mechanism that the server chooses. For clients with online access, the goal is to ensure that the user is still online.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The paragraph at § 170.215(a)(3) requires health IT developers to support the SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation Guide (SMART IG) “SMART [on FHIR] Core Capabilities,” including “permission-offline,” which grants support for refresh tokens. The ONC Cures Act Final Rule states, “…Importantly, the implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(a)(3) requires that patients have the ability to explicitly enable the “offline_access” scope during authorization. If the “offline_access” scope is not enabled by patients, patients will be required to re-authenticate and re-authorize an application's access to their EHI after the application's access token expires…” (85 FR 25747). However, the ability of a patient to explicitly enable the “offline_access” scope during authorization is not described in the implementation specification. ONC clarifies that health IT developers must support the ability for patients to be provided information about an application’s request for persistent access prior to the patient sharing their health information, in order to enable patients to make an informed decision during authorization. Examples include, but are not limited to a health IT developer allowing patients to granularly grant “offline-access” scopes during authorization or clearly providing this information as a notice during authorization. The critical requirement is that patients are empowered to deny authorization for offline access.</p>

<p>This seems to be in line with our interpretation: our consent page makes it clear that the application will get offline access and how to manage this later. They can choose to deny access to the app, or grant it, but can't grant access but remove offline access</p>
