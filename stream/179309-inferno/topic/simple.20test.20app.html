<p>I have a need to do some simple client simulations against a FHIR server, so that I can assure that the server is still behaving as I expect. I would likely use US-Core data, and find the Inferno data-set and/or data-scripts fantastic. What I wonder is how do I automate testing the CREATE operations (REST, not operation or batch) against a FHIR Server... Oh, and DSTU2...</p>

<p>Do you want the CREATE operations to be tested regularly, along with searches / reads?  Or are you looking for just a one-time upload and your server doesn't support transactions?  One thing to note is that the data set is fairly reference-heavy, and the nice thing about transactions is that the server is responsible for doing all the internal mapping so that reosurces point to each other properly.</p>

<p>I am not expecting the tool to do the automation. I have automation. I just need discrete app to call upon in that automation. So very limited feature need. commandline.</p>
