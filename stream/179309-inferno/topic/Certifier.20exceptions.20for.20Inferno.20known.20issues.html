Is that something we can do for Inferno as well?  My proposal would be that any github issue that Inferno has marked with the "willfix" tag can be cited by EHRs when going through certification.  I.e. the EHR can get certified even if there is an unfixed issue in Inferno.</p>

<p>Thanks Cooper! Can you please also submit your question to the <a href="https://inquiry.healthit.gov/support/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/2">Health IT Feedback and Inquiry Portal</a> if you haven't already? That will help us formally triage this issue and publicly publish standardized guidance if necessary. Thank you!</p>
