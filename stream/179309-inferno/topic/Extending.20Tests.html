<p>Could you please help us with Inferno 3.1.0 vs 3.1.1?<br>
Couple of things we noticed any specific reason test suite cut down in 3.1.1?<br>
3.1.0</p>
<p>Test suites are more<br>
3.1.1<br>
DAR checks<br>
FHIR Validators<br>
Other questions:</p>
<p>Is there any difference between the architecture/implementation between ONC and community? I know ONC is a subset of tests from respective Community edition?<br>
Does both do the Same kind of validation after running a request URL?<br>
Eg: For CarePlan, after running USCCP-01 while making assertions and validating the results, is there a difference in implementation in Inferno Program edition and community edition<br>
I know this question could be specific but would like to know how do you arrive at the set of test sequences for a given Resource.<br>
Eg: For CarePlan, you have 9 tests in the latest version of the inferno. However, in the previous version v2.9.0, there were 12. So would like to understand the thought process behind it so that I can extend the tests in a logical way</p>

<p>The US Core 3.1.0 and US Core 3.1.1 tests are built based on different versions of the US Core IG and the changes are a result in differences in the IG.  These changes are not a result of any core Inferno changes, which is currently at Version 2.11.0.  See the <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core-R4/#change-notes-for-ver-311-technical-errata-to-us-core-for-review">US Core 3.1.1 Change Notes</a> for more details.</p>
<p>So, for example, US Core 3.1.1 tests not include a sequence for Pediatric Head Occipital-Frontal Circumference Percentile Tests.  This profile was added in 3.1.1.  Both 3.1.1 and 3.1.0 include Missing Data Tests (DAR checks) and FHIR validation.</p>
<p>The architecture of <a href="https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno">Inferno Community</a> and <a href="https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program">Inferno Program</a> is largely the same, but there are minor differences in the implementation for features that are unique to each.</p>
<p>Both do the same type of FHIR validation.  Request validation is dependent on the IG and interaction being tested (tests for bulk data are different than those for US Core).</p>
<p>USCCP-01 is the same between Inferno Program (<a href="https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program/blob/8a7fa4e226dc139f5fb913a6e9ac413a0cd1d648/lib/modules/uscore_v3.1.0/us_core_careplan_sequence.rb#L208">source</a>) and Inferno Community (<a href="https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno/blob/d1e9b92b3283122c8862a99d94eeb1183df5196e/lib/modules/uscore_v3.1.0/us_core_careplan_sequence.rb#L208">source</a>).  In general these tests are largely the same, but there may be some small underlying differences or complementary tests.</p>
<p>Tests are added or removed based on the requirements in the IG.  You can extend tests by adding to the source code directly or subclassing existing tests (<a href="https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program/blob/development/lib/modules/onc_program/onc_standalone_smart_discovery_sequence.rb">e.g.</a>).</p>
<p>I should note that we are actively working on updating the core of Inferno to make it easier for others to use/develop/understand.  We'll have more to report on that in the coming weeks/month...</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="361097">@ashoka p</span> There are three tests removed in Inferno v2.11.0. One is the restrict access test, the old "USCCP-01". Similar tests from all resource test sequences were moved to separate restrict access test sequence. The other two removed tests are optional search test for patient+category+date and patient+category+status+date. They were removed because CarePlan.period is not a must supported data element.</p>

<p>Thank you both for the responses. If there is any architectural diagram of sorts it would be of immense help for developers like us to extend tests. I have already started extending few. Just to be clear we cannot extend Inferno Program I guess since it strictly checks the must support requirements of US Core?</p>
