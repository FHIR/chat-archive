<p>Hello,<br>
We have some queries related to the Inferno Test Cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Every FHIR resource have shall, may, should and cardinalities - of which only shall is mandatory. But Inferno test cases expect all different data pointers. So how will this work? Also, regarding the representation of these data pointers (including shall, may, should &amp; cardinalities) when they are not available, do we need to have nodes created under the json or we don't have to present the entire node itself in json. Please suggest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inferno Test Cases supports only the FHIR version R4, or it can also have support for other previous FHIR Version? Please suggest.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Are you asking Inferno Program Edition or Inferno Community Edition?<br>
Inferno Program edition tests all SHALL, MustSupport, and invariant<br>
Inferno Program Edition support FHIR 4.0.1  and US Core 3.1.1 only for now. It will support newer FHIR and US Core version with ONC SVAP process.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191506">@Yunwei Wang</span> : Thank you so much for the clarity on the supported versions.<br>
We are considering the Inferno Program Edition. Understood that Inferno tests all Shall, Must Support and Invariant data pointers, now considering any shall parameter were we don't have the data then it that case do we still need to use the node under the Json format or we can omit the entire node itself under the json format..? And whatever process for json format will be applicable for Shall, would that be also applicable to Must Support as well as Invariant data pointers? Please Suggest...!!!</p>

<p>Please take a look of the missing data section in US Core 3.1.1 <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/general-guidance.html#missing-data">here</a></p>

<p>I don't understand this question. Can you clarify?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191506">@Yunwei Wang</span> : Thank you, the link gave much clarity for missing elements of Must Support and Shall. <br>
In the other part of the question what we wanted to ask was "In scenario during the certification/executing inferno program edition, if the test data provided to us has the data for data pointers that are May or Should and we don't support those data pointers. As it is a data requirements for certification and which will also be executed in inferno, in such cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can we ignore those test data as they are May or Should &amp; Only target on Must Support and Shall Test data for certification?<br>
OR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We cannot Ignore that Test data. Do we need to have a node created for those under the json response? if yes, how it will work &amp; how we can represent those data in json response when that data is missing? </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The question is towards the Provided Test Data for Certification vs. Actual Execution During Certification along with Inferno.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="408624">@Nihar</span> It is better to get answers from ONC feedback portal.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191506">@Yunwei Wang</span> : Thank you so much. Sure, we will have this clarified on the ONC Portal. But, just wanted to confirm w.r.t Inferno Program Edition. If we ignore that May &amp; Should Test Data Provided to us then Inferno test case will pass as those test cases will only target Must Support - SHALL &amp; Invariant data pointers....Correct...?</p>
<p>Also, one more thing where we need your help: Regarding Inferno FHIR Validator (<a href="https://inferno.healthit.gov/validator/">https://inferno.healthit.gov/validator/</a>), when we are trying to validate the patient resource we are getting error as "Gateway Time-out" and When we are trying to upload the Package.tgz it is giving an error as "failed to upload IG". Is there any specific step that are we are missing here..? Please suggest.</p>

<p>It is up to the server implementer and tester to get data ready. Inferno itself does not "provide" any data but test if the data "received"  conforms US Core 3.1.1 profiles.<br>
The inferno validator is used by many people so it may time out due to the number of request. You can run source code or docker image locally (by following the "Open Source" link at the bottom).</p>
