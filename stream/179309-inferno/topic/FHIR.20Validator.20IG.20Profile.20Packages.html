<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm wondering how often these packages are reset on the validator (<a href="https://inferno.healthit.gov/validator/">https://inferno.healthit.gov/validator/</a>)  I ask because I was trying to test against a CARIN BB 1.0.0 package and I found that it wasn't loaded.  I was able to successfully upload the latest package from <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/history.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/history.html</a>.  I am then able to use the tool to validate resources to conform to CARIN.  I had done this same thing last week and found that I had to re-load the package this week.</p>
<p>I think my question is 2 part:  1.  How often are these reset?  2.  How often are the shipped/included packages updated to the latest versions?</p>
<p>I guess there is a 3rd scenario possible, that someone else uploaded an older version of the same implementation guide that overwrote the latest one I was testing.  Not sure if that is possible.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Fred</p>
