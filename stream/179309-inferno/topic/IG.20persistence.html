<p>Using the 'app' disto with docker-compose build, start, stop.   POST igs works well and I can GET igs-by-profile.  After restart however, they are not there and I do not see where they may be n written to disk.  Is there a way to make them persist across restarts?</p>

<p>By "'app' distro" I'm assuming you mean <a href="https://github.com/inferno-community/fhir-validator-wrapper">this library</a> which is <code>infernocommunity/fhir-validator-service</code> on DockerHub.  This is the container referenced and used by inferno in its own docker-compose.  It's similarly used by the <a href="https://github.com/inferno-community/fhir-validator-app">fhir-validator-app</a>.</p>
<p>I haven't tried it myself, but you should be able to achieve that using Docker volumes and mounting it at the default cache location in the container (<code>~/.fhir</code> IIRC, but might be worth poking around in the container to be sure).</p>
<p>I'd be curious to hear if you have any success with this and we'd happily take a documentation update if you do.  Otherwise, we'll keep it in mind to check out ourselves at some point.</p>
<p>Some (potentially) help links to Docker docs:</p>

<p>I don't see the package.tgz file or any of its profiles  drop into  /root/.fhir.  The only new files I find after the POST are in /sys/kernel and /proc.  All in memory then?</p>

<p>Yup all in memory then.  I think the only ones that <em>might</em> be cached are those selected from the dropdown which come from the FHIR NPM package server.  Something that we could look into at a later date or talk to the developers of the FHIR core libraries about (I know they've been doing a lot of work developing similar capabilities into the core).</p>
