<p>Hi, we are looking into ways of automating Inferno tests, is there a way to export all test results in a structured format?</p>

<p>We don't currently support that, but it would be a nice feature to have. We'd need another rake task that fetched the results from the database and formatted them.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>On the CLI version of inferno, is it possible to run all SMART on FHIR (US Core) test sequences?<br>
we are trying to figure out the input parameters per module, whether we need to generate the token outside inferno or provide credentials in the config file for Continuous Integration systems...</p>

<p>I meant SMART of FHIR tests and not the US Core tests as I mentioned in the parentheses.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="421859">@Guy Bertental</span> -- sorry for the slow response.  The challenging part of the SMART on FHIR tests is that it requires a browser to be driven by a script to click all the right buttons in the authorization UI.  We did experiment with this early on, and was able to get it to work, but found that it was too hard for others to configure and run so we haven't put effort into maintaining it.  I recommend passing the token to the US Core inferno tests, instead of trying to run the SMART sequences.  But if you are really interested in dusting off that capability and seeing if you can get it working, then I can check the current status (working?/almost working?/or completely broken?) and point you to the right spot so you can try it out.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your response <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192576">@Robert Scanlon</span>, we would have liked to make it work if it's possible, issuing the token outside inferno is exactly what we did eventually but manually with Postman because of the interactive nature of the authorization process, we failed to issue the token with REST calls (cURL tool) and authorization code grant type, This is something that we are missing and still trying to figure out, as this will enable a wide array of tests including SMART oriented tests to our FHIR implementation. but unfortunately, we don't have more time to invest in it now, maybe we will come back to this in the future.</p>

I'm getting 504 (the server responded with a status of 504 (Gateway Time-out)) since yesterday when the online validator tried to fetch the drop-down list of IGs or Profiles.</p>

<p>Is there any chance there is variability in the data that you are sending back to Inferno?  Inferno only evaluates based on what it sees in a given test run, so if for some reason a different set of resources is returned then the results would be different.</p>

<p>Note that US Core v3.1.1 requires systems to support BOTH "url" and "data" for this profile, so we need to see at least one example of using "url" in order for the test to pass.  This requirement is very likely wrong and buts us in a difficult position of either enforcing a wrong constraint or relaxing a stated requirement in a consensus standard.  So the tests not passing is the correct behavior in the case you gave.  I do not know why there is variability in results though.</p>

<p>Hi,<br>
We seem to have the same issue every Monday for some reason. For example, I was getting errors on Pulse Oximetry Test under this state: <a href="https://inferno.healthit.gov/inferno/7HPsNTQzLLg/">https://inferno.healthit.gov/inferno/7HPsNTQzLLg/</a> on Monday and without any change to Observations I am getting no errors today on Tuesday. On Mondays, without any changes to server or data, our tests start failing. I wonder if they do some sort of maintenance on Saturdays like cypress does.<br>

<p>Hi there, reviving this topic. We are also looking to parse test results from the inferno CLI in our CI pipeline.  Are there plans to  support outputting test results in a structured format (i.e. something that can be consumed by the Jenkins junit/xunit plugin)?</p>
