<p>What is the current status of Inferno?</p>

<p>Inferno has a full set of tests for ONC's 2015 Cures Update g10 crtieria (standardized patient + population API), which we are packaging into a standalone tool called "Inferno Program Edition" (program as in ONC Certification program).  That is basically the intersection of US Core v3.1, SMART App Launch and SMART Bulk Data as described in the ONC final rule.  We will release a v1.0 prior to the effective date of the rule (June 30th).  But it basically is a single integrated test suite, and closely aligns with ONC's test procedure.</p>

<p>We are also working on making Inferno easier to extend with tests for other IGs, which is broadly referred to as "Inferno Community Edition".  Inferno was written to be a fairly generic FHIR testing platform, but given our initial focus on a certification tool for ONC, it probably doesn't provide flexibility along the right dimensions yet.  Now that we are close to the initial ONC certification tool release, we are spending more time making the platform more reusable and the tests more composable.</p>
