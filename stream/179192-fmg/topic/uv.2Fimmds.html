<ul>
<li>current draft: <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/ImmunizationFHIRDS/">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/ImmunizationFHIRDS/</a>  (claims to be US realm)</li>
<li>github: <a href="https://github.com/HL7/ImmunizationFHIRDS">https://github.com/HL7/ImmunizationFHIRDS</a></li>
<li>version history: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/immds/history.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/immds/history.html</a> (uv realm)</li>
<li>Dependencies: <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/ImmunizationFHIRDS/qa.html">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/ImmunizationFHIRDS/qa.html</a> - depends on US Core</li>
<li>NIB: <a href="http://www.hl7.org/special/committees/tsc/ballotmanagement/ViewPastNIB.cfm?ballot_pool_id=1138">http://www.hl7.org/special/committees/tsc/ballotmanagement/ViewPastNIB.cfm?ballot_pool_id=1138</a> - uv realm</li>
<li>FMG Approvals: <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Clinical+Decision+Support+For+Immunizations+FHIR+IG+Proposal">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Clinical+Decision+Support+For+Immunizations+FHIR+IG+Proposal</a> - incomplete - obviously we never approved this (editor says: "the initial approval of the IG was before proposals were required")</li>
<li>ballot: it was balloted as US realm in the 2019 September Ballot Cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>You might also note that there's a problem with the code. It will stay as immds, not ImmunizationFHIRDS. That, at least, I can just decide. But the realm thing.... It's not being submitted for ballot, but for publication. So there's no urgency, so discussion about this at the next FMG meeting please</p>
