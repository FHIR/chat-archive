<p>Bob let me know this morning that he's going to end up having to rebuild the IG from scratch anyhow - for another reason.  So he's open to changing the URL from what we had previously discussed.  He <em>can't</em> keep sdoh-cc due to limitations of the Trifolia tool - and while he'll ask them to fix that limitation, there's no chance of them doing it in the time he needs.  However, he's open to moving to sdoh-communitycare.  Given our discussion, I think we'd prefer that.  I need to create the Git project for him one way or the other by the end of the day.  Does anyone <em>NOT</em> prefer sdoh-communitycore to  sdoh-cc-dm?</p>
