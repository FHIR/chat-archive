<p>We're having a problem with tasks that were re-opened for R4 after being deferred in the past. The problem is illustrated by the following advice on the wiki:</p>

<p>Note: If an item is associated with a ballot, it cannot be re-opened once the final disposition spreadsheet has been prepared for that ballot. (If a WG isn't sure, contact the FHIR Management Group) It's always possible to raise a new tracker item, but that item should reference the original and provide some new argument for re-visiting the decision.<br>
Items that are marked as "deferred" will automatically be re-opened after a new release of the product has been published. (Deferred is never a 'final' resolution.)</p>

<p>these two sentences disagree with each other</p>

<p>the correct process is far from clear</p>

<p>Not being able to update "deferred" items would be very problematic.  We could get away with creating new trackers when re-opening other items, though enforcing this will be next to impossible.  We have a full history so we can always reconstitute.  So my preference is to have guidance that previous resolutions be moved into a comment so they're easily visible/discoverable, but to otherwise allow items to be re-opened/reactivated and changed.</p>
