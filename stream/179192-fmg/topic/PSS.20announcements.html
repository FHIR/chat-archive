<p>Announcements here on Zulipare great, but the actual content is missing the point. Rather than repeating the same boilerplate each time, can we see if there's a way to ensure the announcement includes a 1-2 sentence project description?</p>

<p>There's no element in the current Zulip that captures the project summary that includes a 1-2 sentence summary, so that would have to be added to the authoring requirements.</p>

<p>Project description is close enough. Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Continue work on the HL7 DEV FHIR implementation guide that was part of PSS 1277, that is now headed to publication and project completion. This 2nd edition project will continue mapping of ISO/IEEE 11073 SDC and the IHE SDPi profiles to FHIR, as well as addressing FHIR-based device alerting, and additional data reporting capabilities such as waveforms (snippet &amp; streaming).</p>
<p>NOTE: The original Project #1277 for FHIR-based Device Data Reporting was opened in August 2016 with an initial set of intended capabilities, but these continued to get extended over the years with additional project scope. The PSS being proposed will allow this multi-year work program to continue while allowing completion of the #1277 project.</p>
<p>This project will also directly support closely related work in the joint HL7-IHE Gemini SDPi+FHIR project.</p>

<p>If it's longer than 250 words we could truncate.</p>
