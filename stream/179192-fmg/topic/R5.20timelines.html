<p>We had said we were going to raise the question with implementers about their desires wrt R5 timelines after the U.S. rules had dropped - which they now have.  However, obviously circumstances have changed and I expect R5 is not high in most people's priority list right now.  Do we still intend to send out a request for feedback, or are we going to hold off for a bit?</p>

<p>I suspect if we asked right now, we would get an overly pessimistic response, that is asks for pushing out farther than it should be. Seems we should wait until the world is less frantic so that the response we get is based on evaluation of need.</p>

<p>of course we could ask, and treat the results with a grain of salt</p>
