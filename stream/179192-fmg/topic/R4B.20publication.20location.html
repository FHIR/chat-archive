<p>I'm assuming R4B will replace the content at <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir">http://hl7.org/fhir</a> as "current version of FHIR"?</p>

<p>so what is the plan for all of the IGs that are today based on R4. Will they be compelled to revise to R4B? If not, what does that mean?</p>

<p>If/when you update your IG, you can choose whether you move or not.  I don't think we'd force it the way we did with 4.0.1, but I'd expect the FMG to ask questions if you didn't move to 4.3.0</p>

<p>I'm not sure what factors you're looking for.  No breaking changes (and generally no changes at all) to anything other than EBM, Med governance and subscription stuff.  (And subscription stuff and EBM are net new, not changes per se.)  The "breaking" stuff is things like "enumerations of possible resources" will now allow additional resources, Bundles now allow new resources, etc.</p>

<p>I thought subscription stuff was in an IG, not being pulled into R4B. Why is the IG not sufficient?</p>

<p>but if these are the three things.. then I think it should be clear when and why an IG would need to care about R4 vs R4B... and thus they should not be based on R4B unless they need one of these three things. right? Thus, if anything the IG population should be discouraged from building off of R4B.</p>

<p>Re: subscriptions, there are two new resources: <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> and <code>SubscriptionStatus</code>.  Modeling them in R4 was a <em>lot</em> of Parameters/Basic/Extension.  Given that anyone implementing topic-based subscriptions is at least doing a software update (to actually implement them), adding the new resources seemed like a lower bar.  Especially given the context of a not-too-distant R5 publication.</p>

<p>On John's other note: R4B also contains technical corrections on top of R4:4.0.1, so I assume we want to direct people to 4.3.0 over 4.0.1 as a general rule.</p>
<p>I spoke about it offline with someone, but assume there is a need for further technical corrections in R4 about a year out.  Applying them to 4.0.1 means also trying to backfill changes from 4.3.0... I think that makes publication of 4.3.1 significantly more likely than 4.0.2.  I also assume trying to publish <em>both</em> a 4.0.2 and 4.3.1 release would cause a lot of people to resign their positions   ;-)</p>

<p>They should absolutely be based on R4B whenever possible because R4B includes a lot of technical corrections.  They should only use 4.0.1 when absolutely necessary (and I can't think of a situation where that would occur...)</p>

<p>because it introduces breaking changes. Is it the new current? I'm not sure...</p>

<p>Yeah, I agree this isn't an obvious call -- I was basing my assumption on the wya Lloyd has characterized R4B as "technical correction"</p>

<p>(I know it's not purely one, and I'm not suggesting Lloyd has said that either! Just characterized it as having strong technical correction nature.)</p>
