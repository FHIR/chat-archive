<p>I just filled out the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3KB3GKR">connectathon survey</a> and there were a couple of questions where I was limited to a single response even though more than one option applied; I noted this by filling out the "Other" field, but it might be worth converting these to multi-select (checkboxes rather than radio buttons) in the future.  This applies to Question 3, and Question 8 FYI <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194993">@Sandra Vance</span> .</p>

<p>I believe that we switched it to single answers a few connectathons ago. Will put this on my list of things to follow up on after the event. Thanks Josh.</p>
