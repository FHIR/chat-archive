<p>During OO call a question came up whether in case of changing an attribute from normative to STU for a structural change whether the entire resource then becomes STU again or just the attribute.  My understanding is that just the attribute turns STU, not the resource.  Can we clearly confirm, refute that understanding?  BTW, there were still some folks on the call who believed that in an earlier call (not OO but another one - not clear which one) it was indicated that everything in R5 would turn "automatically" STU, which was a clear misunderstanding, but nevertheless still present among some.</p>

<p>I don't think you can change an attribute from normative to STU.  You can make changes (e.g. adding additional choice types or target resources) and those additional elements might be STU.  The resource as a whole can't become STU once normative.  Changes to a resources can be flagged as STU though.</p>

<p>Changes to normative elements need to comply with the inter-version compatibility rules</p>
