<p>How about this governance wording?: </p>
<p>With regard to relationship between Standards and Regulations, and appropriate mentions of Regulations within Standards;  Standards conformance can be required by Regulations (no reference should be made of the regulation in that standard),  Standards can have clauses traced back to Regulations ,  Standards can aspire to be required by Regulations,  but Standards should not require Regulations conformance.  </p>
<p>Note "should not", as a indication of trend guidance<br>
also, this is very similar to REST guidance on pointers directionality, that thing that comes later points at the thing that existed before.<br>
But the main point is that a declaration in an Standard (implementation guide) of a "shall be compliant with regulation X", is a legal opinion. HL7 is not an organization authorized to make legal opinions. It is a standards organization, authorized to publish standard.  It is very appropriate for HL7 Standards to remind their reader of potential legal obligations.</p>

<p>SHALL be compliant with regulation X isn't a legal opinion.  It's a statement of expectation.  A standard could require adherence to a regulation (in order to be compliant with the standard) even if a legal opinion indicated that adherence wouldn't otherwise be needed.  (Side note - Da Vinci doesn't mention the specific regulations when asserting SHALL/SHOULD language)</p>
