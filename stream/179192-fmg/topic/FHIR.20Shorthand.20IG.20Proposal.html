<p>FMGers, FHIR-I has approved a NIB for FHIR Shorthand targeting the May ballot cycle. Can you please consider at your earliest opportunity the IG proposal for FSH:  <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Shorthand" target="_blank" title="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Shorthand">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Shorthand</a> . I guess the official deadline was Feb. 16, but in some sense this isn't a "normal" IG with clinical content and profiles, but rather, using the IG as a vehicle to deliver content to the ballot. Nonetheless, it needs some attention and perhaps the official blessing of FMG.</p>
