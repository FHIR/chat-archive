<p>DeviceDefinition productShelfLife changes in R4B because the ProductShelfLife datatype was changed by the med governance folks.  I think we should look at splitting the datatype in R4B into ProductShelfLife (remains unchanged) and ProductShelfLife2 (has med governance changes).  For discussion tomorrow.</p>

<p>Also would like to discuss the broader point from that thread: do we think R4B is consistent with our current versioning rules, given what we expect to be included in the release? For the reasons I listed there, I think the answer is "no, R4B counts as a breaking change as currently defined."</p>

<p>R4B <em>is</em> technically a breaking change.  There's no question about that.  However, most systems will be able to treat it as a technical correction - because they don't use the parts that are breaking.  That has always been the objective.</p>

<p>If we agree it is a breaking change, why do we not apply our <del>typical</del> normatively documented versioning rules from <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/versions.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/versions.html</a> so that everybody understands this? I don't see how this would make R4B less useful for implementers; to the contrary. Still: if we want to break our existing versioning rules, why don't we amend them?</p>

<p>It's NOT a breaking change for the vast majority of the community and we <em>want</em> everyone who can to treat it as a technical correction.  We carefully scoped the specification to ensure this could occur.  I don't understand why we would suddenly decide to change a direction that was agreed on over 2 years ago when we're perhaps a month from publishing.</p>

<p>My position is that we <em>might</em> change now there's a clear picture of what's on the table, and it's clear how this contradicts our published process. Or maybe we just need to change our process.</p>
<p>(It has also taken us a lot longer to get to the point of this publication than we thought, and as a result we also have a much better sense of what is in scope for future versions. Just saying we have been surprised by the process as it has unfolded already, and we might change our minds because of this.)</p>

<p>(I'll stop repeating myself right after this, I promise -- just want to make sure this thread reflects our back-and-forth up to now, since it has been split across FHIR-I and Zulip.) Our current rules do not incorporate this kind of consideration into the definition of a breaking change.</p>

<p>We're not changing our definition of breaking change.  We're clear that there are <em>pieces</em> of what's happened in R4B that are absolutely breaking.  However, they've been isolated in such a manner that for most implementers, there is no breaking change at all.  And many of the intended implementers of the breaking pieces of R4B have not implemented R4 - and thus there's nothing to "break".  The end result is a release that, for most implementers, should be no different than 4.0.1 was.</p>

<p>(For the record: Grahame settled this neatly by pointing out that <code>4.3.0</code> <em>is</em> a major version update over <code>4.0.1</code>, since the versioning scheme is "[publication].[major].[minor]" (with an optional ".[patch]" as a fourth component) and therefore breaking changes are allowed.</p>

<p>Exactly what breaking changes? We need to be able to be very clear to all of the IG authors, toolkit implementers, applications, servers, etc... WHAT should they lookout for? It seems our message today is vastly different than originally, as originally R4B was only going to change the medicine product stuff that few care about.  If someone is fully focused on US-Core, or IPA, or IPS... should they have worries with R4B?  Meaning I feel that there has been some "breaking changes" float into R4B that are not as transparent as the FHIR-core members feel they have been transparent about.</p>

<p>I still think the answer is "no worries" here. consistent with our original messaging. The concern I expressed this week is more about clients that are interacting with wider "FHIR native" server capabilities like <code>/_history</code> that can return diverse resource types</p>

<p>Right.  If a server starts hosting SubscriptionTopic, for example and a 4.0.1 retrieves a history dump of everything (the latter being exceptionally uncommon in real production systems, and even less common where the versions of source and target aren't carefully coordinated), the Bundle would contain resources that the 4.0.1 parser wouldn't handle.  From a practical perspective, low risk because anyone who's doing a full data dump is generally going to have a tight business relationship with the source.  But technically, still a possible failure mode.</p>

<p>Right, but wouldn't the clients accessing that server for analytics have a deep and specific association with the server - particularly if they're grabbing an unfiltered set of "everything", not limiting to only patient data or some specific subset (whether defined by the request or policy).  <em>That</em> should be pretty rare...</p>
