<p>Hi all! While FMG  discussed the use of Pacific time for the January WGM, we did not discuss it in terms of the Connectathon. While it seems safe to assume that we would align the time zones of the two events, we wanted to get official confirmation from FMG. If you could respond with an up or down on that, I'd appreciate it. </p>
<p>Sandy would like to discuss timing for opening and closing sessions, but I haven't heard back from her yet on her specific question.</p>

<p>That makes sense, but the (rather minimal) documentation that I've found so far does state the times as Eastern.  I was looking for it because I was making a slide with the Connectathon details for a presentation tomorrow and I used Eastern because that's what I saw (I don't recall now exactly where it was that I saw it, but I'm sure I can find it).  If it's going to be Pacific we had better decide and document that now.</p>

<p>I think that setting the precedent that the kick-off and conclusion of the connectathon will be in the same timezone as the WGM means that people in varying timezones will all get an opportunity to experience one of those.</p>

<p>I agree, and that's what I expected.  It was just confusing when the only information I found stated it otherwise.</p>
