<p>recommend we rename "Announcements" to "Announcements, Official". It is common to have an 'Announce' location for people to test if they have attached to a forum, and indicate they exist... simple misunderstanding...</p>

<p>Official sounds like it needs to come only from us.  How about "Announcements, Formal"?</p>

<p>Not sure what the difference between Official and Formal really would convey.  What is it that we want the audience to do differently than "regular" announcements?  Still leaning towards Official though.</p>
