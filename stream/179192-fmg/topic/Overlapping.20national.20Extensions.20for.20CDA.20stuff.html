<p>There are currently several national extensions (US, CH an AU as far as I can tell) aiming to add CDA header information (e.g. information recipient) to Composition resources but none are reusable because they all reference nationally profiled target resources.<br>
A CR to harmonize this in R4 was raised, voted and resolved in 2017 but never applied: <br>
<a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-13635">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-13635</a></p>
<p>We currently have an identical requirement in Germany. Should we create yet another national extension or is there a better way for us to move forward?</p>

<p>We would very much prefer to create a generic R4 extension to preadopt added elements in R5 but at this point there is no way of telling whether the elements will indeed be added in time and what the Canonical URL for  the extension should look like...</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191450">@Simone Heckmann</span> Have you followed up with the Structured Documents WG?  They're on the hook for applying the change.  I know the TSC is looking at organization health metrics tied to timely resolution of tracker items, but until that's in place, the only thing to do is chase the work group (or alternatively, apply the tracker item yourself...)</p>
