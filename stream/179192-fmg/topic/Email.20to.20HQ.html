<p>Hi there! We go the following message from a person who doesn't want to go through public forums - where should I direct him?</p>
<p>Dear Sir / Madam,<br>
my name is Erkka Nurmi and I work as a research assistant at University of Jyväskylä in Finland. We are currently researching a national (in Finland) level use-case in which FHIR could be a very good solution.<br>
We have a short list of requirements and according to our initial research FHIR does fill almost all of them. We would like to however get an opinion from a source with more experience with FHIR than ourselves. Some of the related information is confidential so we are unable to use FHIR-forums for expertise.<br>
Could you direct us to a source we could use? We are thankful for any help you can provide.</p>
