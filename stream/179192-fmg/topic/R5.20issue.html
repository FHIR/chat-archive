<p>Our purpose in putting out the R5 "for comment" ballot was to get the answer to one question - "Are you comfortable with the proposed list of Normative artifacts and the data elements within them that have been slated for normative status?"  However, when we reviewed and approved R5 to go forward for ballot last Wed, none of us twigged to the fact that nowhere in the ballot intro, or in the documentation of the resources themselves, did we either a) ask the question; or b) indicate what the candidates were.  In short, our "for comment" ballot isn't accomplishing much <span aria-label="sad" class="emoji emoji-2639" role="img" title="sad">:sad:</span> </p>
<p>We need to discuss whether we want to submit a ballot correction that updates the ballot to have the relevant information.  We also need to decide what the relevant information is because though we have solicited feedback from various WGs over time as to what resources they wanted to make normative, we've never put together a finalized list, nor reviewed it.  I think at this point we're going to have to forego any discussion of what data elements are flagged as "STU only" because there's little chance of getting that information.  However, we could theoretically identify the candidate resources.</p>
<p>In preparation for the discussion, my lists of candidate resources are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>resources where work groups have indicated approval for the resource to proceed to normative:<br>
AllergyIntolerance<br>
Condition<br>
Procedure<br>
Questionnaire<br>
QuestionnaireResponse<br>
SearchParameter<br>
ImplementationGuide<br>
AuditEvent<br>
Provenance<br>
MedicationRequest<br>
Medication</li>
</ul>
<p>Resources where there's been discussion, but no formal approval (and even sometimes outright resistance) to a resource going normative (though in some cases, reality is that they're defacto normative anyhow):<br>
Composition?<br>
ConceptMap?<br>
Consent?<br>
Device?<br>
DocumentReference?<br>
Encounter?<br>
ImagingStudy?<br>
Immunization?<br>
Practitioner?<br>
PractitionerRole?<br>
RelatedPerson?</p>
<p>Can we please add this as a high-priority item for our call tomorrow?  (And please review and see if there are any that should be on one of these lists that are missing)</p>
