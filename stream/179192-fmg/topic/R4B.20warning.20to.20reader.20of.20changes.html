<p>I am concerned that we will be inconsistent with our warnings to readers about future changes. Discussion today was around ConceptMap, but are we then going to look at the delta between R4 and current build for other resources that we can predict will have major changes? For example Media has been merged into DocumentReference...    If we choose to put the dragon in to all resources that are predicted to have major changes, then R4B will look very scary relative to R4... do we really want to do that?</p>
