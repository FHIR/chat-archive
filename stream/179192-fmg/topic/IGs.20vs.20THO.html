<p>I have heard of many IGs that have received a comment that defining URL for vocabulary should be anchored in THO. (see <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-35612">FHIR-35612</a> ). I don't think there is such a rule, and it does not seem appropriate as a general rule. It certainly is good QA modeling rules. But good QA modeling rules should not be appearing as member ballot comments.</p>

<p>The rule is that if an artifact is FMM3+, it's expected to leverage an external terminology (which includes THO).  Continuing to use a FHIR-managed terminology for anything other than elements of type 'code' requires approval from the TSMG.  (Which generally means that there's an agreement that it's not going to be useful anywhere else, that there's sufficient oversight of the terminology quality of the content, and that maintenance on an ever 2.5-3.5 year basis is sufficient.)  <em>Prior</em> to FMM3, then local terminologies are fine, but they should have a URL that indicates that they're "temporary".</p>

<p>However, for IGs, we're generally not surfacing FMM yet, so it might be a bit difficult to know what set of rules to apply.  The general rule though is:</p>
<ul>
<li>url that indicates it's temporary</li>
<li>external (e.g. THO) URL</li>
<li>approval received from TSMG</li>
</ul>

<p>I can understand the intent, but I think this rule needs to be defined better than even what you express. </p>
<ul>
<li>I think it is quite common for a valueSet to be defined and only live in an IG, as the valueSet is specific to the use-cases covered by the valueSet. In some cases the valueSet is there purely to enable rules such as slicing.</li>
<li>what does a temporary url look like? Have we ever defined this concept?</li>
<li>TSMG needs to be far more approachable. <ul>
<li>I still can't submit anything, as I can't get the terminology build to succeed. This alone keeps me from addressing 5 CR for FHIR core. </li>
<li>Not clear to me how one addresses a CR filed against FHIR core or an IG and re-invents that CR to submit to TSMG in a way that results in original CR getting addressed properly.</li>
<li>the HL7 co-chairs hardly understand how to approach TSMG, and many IGs are written by non HL7 members</li>
</ul>

<p>FMG is unlikely to do that.  The work group will need to do one of three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>change to a URL that indicates the code system is temporary</li>
<li>put their terminology into an external source</li>
<li>get TSMG approval to have their code systems maintained within their IG</li>

<p>If you're below FMM 3, the first bullet applies.  And you can seek TSMG at any point.  If you're FMM3 or above, you must have done one of the latter two.  So regardless of FMM, one of the 3 bullets holds.</p>

<p>For value sets, no.  There has to be a good reason to put a value set into THO - i.e. it's both complex in its definition, it's likely to be re-used elsewhere, and the rules around its maintenance can be clearly expressed such that maintenance by a process other than WG ballot is 'safe'.</p>

<p>Yes.  I'm putting together a presentation that will go out at the next co-chairs meeting that will outline the expectations for all work groups, along with the expectation of when the FMG will start enforcing the rules (Sept. ballot cycle).  If you have balloters driving you to fix sooner, you'll need to negotiate with them if you want to delay until that cycle - given that you'll have to do it eventually regardless.</p>
