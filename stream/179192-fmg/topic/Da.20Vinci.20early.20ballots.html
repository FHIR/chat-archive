<p>The TSC has approved a couple of specs going to ballot opening Oct. 25th.  I've been asked what the other deadlines are.  One obvious issue is that management groups should presumably be asked as part of the approval process for out-of-cycle ballots.  Typically we say final freeze about 4 days before ballot open (so Oct. 21st) and initial QA deadline either 2 weeks prior (or 1 week prior with WG sign-off) which would be Oct. 7 or 14.  Substantive content deadline would be 2 weeks prior to the 7th - which would be yesterday.  Can we confirm these dates on our call Wed?</p>

<p>i won't be on the call, but seems reasonable</p>

<p>Actually, I just remembered that we cancelled this week's call.  So I'll plan to confirm these dates unless anyone yells by call time tomorrow.</p>
