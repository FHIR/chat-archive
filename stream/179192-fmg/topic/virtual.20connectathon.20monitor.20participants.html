<p>Given that FHIR Connectathon is virtual, I have a situation that I think others are also in, that I want to get clarification around. I have a formal role to participate in connectathon tracks as a human monitor and SME and not as a system connecting to other systems. (i.e., SANER as a monitor, and careplan as a Patient Empowerment advocate). What kind of registration is expected of me? I am not worried about the nominal cost. I am more wanting clarification of the correct/proper pathway, which is related to discouraging the incorrect/improper pathway. If there is no need to formally register, and just  work with the track leadership; then this is a fine conclusion. I simply don't want to encourage formal registration for some people in my situation, while others come in with no formal registration.  My recommendation  is that these monitoring roles can be done with no registration and just working with the track lead.</p>
