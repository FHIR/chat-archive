<p><a href="https://www.hl7.org/events/fhir-connectathon/">https://www.hl7.org/events/fhir-connectathon/</a> makes it look like a 3-day event, but it's really (right??) two days, with a kickoff Monday. Some tracks though are bleeding into some or all of Monday, and some attendees are expecting a three-day event. This is causing confusion and disappointment.</p>

<p>Yes, it is nominally a 48 (actually about 49 1/2) hour period - with the bulk of it in 2 approx. 8 hour sessions (based on Central time for this round), but with parts of it occurring on 3 different days.  So I agree that can be confusing and I don't think we have been doing anything that makes it especially clear.</p>

<p>You are correct. When we went to virtual it was decided that we would do a kick off on the afternoon before because of time zone issues. Publishing the kick off for the day before then prompts some track leads to kick off the day before. If we put the start date for the day after the kick off people may be frustrated that they missed the kick off. Perhaps we can clarify on the events page that it is two days but that preparation calls happen in advance. Thoughts?</p>

<p>We can be explicit: Connectathon is:  "Jan 11-12, with Kickoff on the evening of Jan 10". The trick is to be consistent about this across the various pages.</p>

<p>Maybe label it as "48+ hours of coding, testing and technical discussions"?</p>

<p>Depending on the timezone and the project, sometimes lots of work happens on the day of the kickoff, sometimes not much</p>

<p>Certainly our European time virtual connectathon had a lot happening on the kick-off day and much less on the closing day.</p>

<p>We can certainly clean this language up. Thank you for bringing it up as we didn't realize it was an issue for anyone but it makes sense!</p>
