<p>Here's the email I sent to TSC for discussion re: google sheets</p>
<div class="spoiler-block"><div class="spoiler-header">
</div><div class="spoiler-content" aria-hidden="true">
<p>Future agenda item: often groups within HL7 use spreadsheets (formally or informally) as:</p>
<ul>
<li>venue for collaborative work upstream of standardization (e.g., <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaFYPSSq4oplTvw_4OgOn6h2Bs_CMvCAU9CqC4tPBgk/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaFYPSSq4oplTvw_4OgOn6h2Bs_CMvCAU9CqC4tPBgk/edit#gid=0</a>),</li>
<li>tool for analyzing standards (e.g., <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15hNGV7Hol76pA73C5XCx_rHOoSYfG8E56PboF3ij9-k/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15hNGV7Hol76pA73C5XCx_rHOoSYfG8E56PboF3ij9-k/edit#gid=0</a>), or</li>
<li>system for tracking granular data about the use of standards (e.g., <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1COTmtlXgGWuFpoSr1ZQQK30S7ReCpVsk_NZI6xIeSHI/edit#gid=1272626212">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1COTmtlXgGWuFpoSr1ZQQK30S7ReCpVsk_NZI6xIeSHI/edit#gid=1272626212</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>FMG would like to request that TSC establish guidance condoning the use of these kinds of spreadsheets, would like for HL7 HQ to establish a shared drive or other system where such resources can be stored and managed by HL7. As we see it, the requirements are for a collaborative editing environment that supports (realtime shared editing, comments, resolution) and spreadsheet capabilities (formulas, sort, filter). As long as these documents are managed in a location that HL7 approves, we think they're a useful adjunct to Confluence's native capabilities, and links to such documents could be included in Confluence spaces.</p>

<p>The only other thing I'd add is that Confluence's "spreadsheet" capabilities are limited and there are times when a more sophisticated tool is needed.  Obviously, where Confluence meets the need, it should be used in preference.</p>
