<p>Out of DevDays, a couple of action items for FMG:<br>
- Consider extending the IG proposal process to require a section of "patient impact/relevance" which describes (in patient-friendly language) how the implementation guide is relevant to patients<br>
- Add to the QA criteria for FHIR IGs a requirement that every IG will have a section that explains - in patient-friendly (which will presumably also be media-friendly) terms - what the intention of the IG is in terms of patient impact.  Obviously a few IGs will exist that will have no patient impact.  But most should have something useful to say.  While our focus needs to be on implementer-targeted, we want to ensure that our specifications are patient-accessible.  I.e. patients who come to our community should be able to understand how the different pieces we build are relevant to them - and for some, are directly usable by them.  That will enable them to either use stuff or advocate for change if what we're producing isn't actually meeting their needs.</p>
<p>The above are candidates for our meeting next week</p>
