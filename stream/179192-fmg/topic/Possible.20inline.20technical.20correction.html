<p>Is this something that FMG can just authorise me to remove directly without requiring a technical correction via TSC? (note that as product director, I can fix URLs, and alter header and footer versions and links and so forth, but removing this paragraph is byeond my authority)</p>

<p>The part about the Comments section on the bottom of each page? The spec hasn't had that in a very long time. It hasn't been a problem. I could agree to remove it, but am not compelled that it is important to remove at this time. I would rather accept that the publication is what it is.</p>

<p>We know we have to make a technical correction shortly.  This was wrong in STU 2 as well (and we lived with that for 1.5 years).  An extra week isn't an issue.  That said, this is a very simple technical correction - the removal of content that is unambiguously wrong and has no substantive impact on implementers or the interpretation of the spec, so I have no problem with that occurring without a formal change request.  However, a more relevant question is what the TSC is comfortable with given that it's their call . . .</p>
