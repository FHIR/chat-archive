<p>For next call: when we agreed to proceed with R4B, I thought we were making a one-time expedient decision to produce a quick narrow release. But now I see discussions about R4C, and forking off of future releases, etc -- and I worry this will lead to confusion and madness!</p>

<p>The notion of R4C I think is more about Grahame's concerns that R5 might be the last release as well as "core FHIR" moves very slowly.  We want to be able to iterate certain content faster.  We haven't really figured out how we can do that in as painless a way as possible.  There are no concrete plans for an R4C at this time, but there's absolutely a need for a discussion around how we can realistically manage differing needs for change cycling speed going forward.</p>
