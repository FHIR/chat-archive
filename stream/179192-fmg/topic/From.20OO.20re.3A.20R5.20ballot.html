<p>Report from OO (thanks Hans!) is they are looking at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>taking Device normative (certain elements), but unclear if this is ready in the Jan timeframe. Would like to do more connectathon testing to get there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>maybe</em> taking Specimen normative (certain elements), but unclear if this is ready in the Jan timeframe. Would like to do more connectathon testing to get there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some changes to Observation in R5 to introduce richer support for specimens + devices (currently backed by normative elements)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing maturity of NutritionOrder</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>... all of these would benefit from more connectathon testing; none is a sure thing as of today.</p>

<p>Also for discussion: we're seeing the pain of normative resources with <code>0..1</code> elements that really <em>should have been</em> <code>0..*</code>. Perhaps as new resources are designed and as existing resources climb up the maturity scale, we should be asking editors to bias toward allowing <code>0..*</code> by default, unless they can <em>robustly reject the possibility</em> that they will ever want more than one element in a slot.</p>

<p>had I known OO was going to be asked this, I would have been there to promote DocumentReference. This has had extensive testing in both US-Core and IHE. And has signrficant implementations in the EHR vendors</p>
