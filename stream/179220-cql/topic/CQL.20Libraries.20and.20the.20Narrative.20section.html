<p>In looking at many FHIR Library examples I see that the narrative section is filled with text that claims to be generated, can anyone point to the tool/tools that is doing this generation?</p>

<p>It's most likely being done by the IGPublisher.  It has the ability to generate at least rudimentary narrative for most resources.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span> can confirm whether anything special is happening for CQL, but I doubt it.</p>

<p>We use the narrative generation from the tooling, but because it also requires some CQL-specific tooling, we haven't been able to plug it in to the base publishing pipeline yet. There is tooling in the <a href="https://github.com/cqframework/cqf-tooling" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/cqframework/cqf-tooling">CQF-Tooling</a> project that we use to generate the narratives for libraries and measures, then we keep that narrative in the examples we put in implementation guides so the publication tooling leaves it in place.</p>
