<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span>  / <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194178">@JP</span> Have you guys started to think about FHIR R4B support in the Java Engine? There are a number of model changes that will necessitate a new model info file for the translator and I think a new FHIRHelpers library maybe. Having those would be useful in preparation for updating my IBM FHIR CQL backend to R4B.</p>

<p>Yes. We need a couple upstream changes from HAPI due to the way our ModelInfo generation works. Those should be landing in the next few weeks based on the chatter I see in the hapi stream. Also upcoming: R5.</p>

<p>I expect it'll take another while after that before we're able to do the actual implementation. So, maybe a month or two out before we get it done. You have any specific timeframe in mind?</p>

<p>I wasn't given a specific timeframe for this work. It will probably depend a lot on when the spec becomes GA, but I will check with the server team and see what they think and get back to you. Right now, my stuff is failing during model resolution because there are quite a few code class differences between 4.0.1 and 4.3.0. We've got some stuff in the ModelResolver that smooths out the differences between 4.0.0 and 4.0.1, but this seems like a much larger hack to patch from 4.0.1 to 4.3.0.</p>

<p>I talked with the server team. They expect R4B will be published late January or early February <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/R4B">see</a> and the plan is to release a new server version that supports R4B at that time. The IBM FHIR server is inherently single version right now, so I need to have something working around then. That said, I spent some more time debugging why the engine was failing in our R4B branch and I was able to get over the immediate hurdle by patching the ModelResolver. I can run with the 4.0.1 definitions now, so it isn't urgent to have the 4.3.0 models until someone comes wanting to write CQL against the new resources.</p>
