<p>hello,<br>
I have gone through the AHRQ project(<a href="https://cds.ahrq.gov/authoring/build" target="_blank" title="https://cds.ahrq.gov/authoring/build">https://cds.ahrq.gov/authoring/build</a>) . I got some doubt , can we generate cql file for MeasureReport by using this tool or this tool has only generated cql for cds-hooks i.e. for PlanDefinition ??If yes then can we have any open-source tools that can generates measure-report related cql file.<br>
Thank you in Advance.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="212752">@Surya</span> -- I moved your question to a separate topic where it might get better response.  The AHRQ CDS Authoring Tool that you referenced is designed for the CDS use case (rather than eCQMs).  That said, it exports normal CQL logic, so it's possible that the exported logic could be used in eCQMs too (as long as you want <em>FHIR</em>-based eCQMs).  If you want QDM-based eCQMs, however, then FHIR-based logic won't work for you.  The task of creating the more measure-specific aspects (like MeasureReport) is not supported at all by CDS Authoring Tool.  The only authoring tool I'm currently aware of for creating CQL-based <em>measures</em> is the <a href="https://www.emeasuretool.cms.gov/" target="_blank" title="https://www.emeasuretool.cms.gov/">Measure Authoring Tool</a>, which uses the QDM data model.</p>

<p>Thank You for the reply Chris...Let us suppose,I want to create a cql file for generating MeasureReport(eCQM specific cql files ) in FHIR DataModel then AHRQ CDS-Authoring Tool  is useful or not??</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="212752">@Surya</span> -- Many measures are defined using "Initial Population (IPP)", "Denominator", "Denominator Exclusions", "Denominator Exceptions", and "Numerator".  The CDS Authoring Tool has tabs for "Inclusions", "Exclusions", "Sub-populations", and "Recommendations".  You could use the CDS Authoring Tool to write most of the logic -- "Inclusions" is basically the same as eCQM "Denominator".  "Exclusions" is basically the same as eCQM "Denominator Exclusions", and you could use "Sub-populations" to craft "Numerator" criteria.  Then you'd export the CQL from CDS Authoring Tool and have to modify the rest by hand (renaming expressions if necessary, adding IPP or Exceptions if necessary, etc).</p>
<p>The CDS Authoring Tool is not going to export HQMF or FHIR PlanDefinitions, Measures, etc.  So you would need to create those yourself.</p>

<p>Hello <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191469">@Chris Moesel</span> ,<br>
Is there any tool available which is supporing FHIR DataModel and generating eCQMs related cql(like measure related) ?? I have seen MAT(Measure Authoring Tool) but It is on QDM(Quick DataModel).so basically I am searching for a tool which can generate cql for eCQMs on Fhir DataModel.</p>
<p>Thank You in advance</p>

<p>There is a plugin for the <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank" title="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> editor that supports QDM as well as all versions of FHIR. It allows you to write CQL, validate it against the data model, and generate the ELM. Search for langage-cql in the packages.</p>

<p>Hi @Surya, OpenCDS refers to a consortium, as well as an architecture for CDS distribution and evaluation services, I'm not aware of any authoring tool there. Can you provide a link to a more specific tool you are asking about?</p>

<p>I have seen AHRQ(<a href="https://cds.ahrq.gov/authoring/build" target="_blank" title="https://cds.ahrq.gov/authoring/build">https://cds.ahrq.gov/authoring/build</a>) for cds-hooks related cql files generation which is in Fhir DataModel and MAT(<a href="https://www.emeasuretool.cms.gov/" target="_blank" title="https://www.emeasuretool.cms.gov/">https://www.emeasuretool.cms.gov/</a>) for generation of eCQM related cql files but it is in QDM. I have just found some reference of openCDS(http://www.opencds.org/),so I keen to know about that...like do CDSopen provides any authoring tool related to eCQMS or PlanDefinition.</p>
<p>Do you have idea about any tool which generates eCQM cql files for measures on Fhir Datamodel??</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="212752">@Surya</span> -- CQL provides the logic used in measures and CDS.  To write a complete eCQM (using FHIR) you would also need to author instances of the appropriate FHIR resources from the FHIR Clinical Reasoning (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/clinicalreasoning-module.html" target="_blank" title="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/clinicalreasoning-module.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/clinicalreasoning-module.html</a>).  I'm not aware of any tools that will help you author these using a graphical interface.  You may need to manually author them using a text editor (if you are on Windows, perhaps Notepad++ with the FHIR plugin).  As for authoring CQL, I noted how the CDS Authoring Tool could <em>potentially</em> be used for this, but since it is designed for CDS, it would still require some manual adjustments to the output.  I would recommend you try <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191359">@Bryn Rhodes</span>'s suggestion and use atom with the CQL extension.  It means you will need to learn how to author CQL manually, but this is a worthwhile investment -- and CQL is designed to be easily learned.  I'd start by looking at the Author's Guide (chapter 2) of the specification at <a href="https://cql.hl7.org/" target="_blank" title="https://cql.hl7.org/">https://cql.hl7.org/</a>.</p>
