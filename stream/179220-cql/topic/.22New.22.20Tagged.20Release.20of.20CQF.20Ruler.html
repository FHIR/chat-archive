<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194178">@JP</span> is there going to be a tagged release for CQF Ruler in the near future? We're using it as part of a pipeline and would prefer to use a tagged release,  however the biggest feature we want is the recent switch to it only being a singleton FHIR server (versus the previous STU3 and R4), so there's no release with that yet. If there's not going to be one in the near future, can we consider the current master as stable and working or is there a previous commit you'd recommend for that?</p>

<p>Yes. We’re working through regressions caused by the refactoring. The last one I know about are some issues with Measure evaluation. After that we plan to start a release train for the CQL components. It’s probably a couple weeks away.</p>
