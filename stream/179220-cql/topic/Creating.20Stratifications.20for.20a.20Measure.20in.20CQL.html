<p>Hey all,<br>
Hopefully this is the right place to ask this question.  I'm currently trying to create logic for a measure and have run into a roadblock when trying to create stratifications for the populations.  I've checked the HL7 CQL author's guide and the developer's guide (along with almost every page available on the CQL Release 1 site) but have found no hints on how to proceed.  Does anyone know how this is supposed to be done or could point me to an example that I can work off of? I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>The ecqm-content-r4-2021 repo has <a href="https://github.com/cqframework/ecqm-content-r4-2021/blob/master/input/resources/measure/PrimaryCariesPreventionasOfferedbyPCPsincludingDentistsFHIR.json">this</a> example Measure which contains stratifiers. I'm not sure it is super clarifying, but that repo is a good place to poke around for real world usage coming from CMS.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191919">@Arvind Jagannathan</span> are you by chance using FSH to create Library/Measures? If so I can provide a minimal example.</p>
