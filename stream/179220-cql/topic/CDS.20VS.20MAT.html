<p>Hi, folks!<br>
I'm on a starting point of authoring an cql measure. Haven't used CDS Authoring tool before as well as MAT.<br>
I can't try MAT as it requires HARP User ID (I'm not a resident of the US)<br>
I was wondering what's the core different between the tools?<br>
Thanks!</p>

<p>They are quite different.</p>
<p>The MAT is specifically designed for developing measures, so it has many measure types and concepts built in.  It will export a measure package that contains measure specifications.  It also assumes that authors know CQL, as it requires authors to type CQL into the tool.</p>
<p>The CDS Authoring Tool is designed for developing Clinical Decision Support.  While it shares some ideas w/ measure (e.g., Inclusions and Exclusions), it doesn't support any official measure types and does not export CQL as measures. In addition, it assumes users do <em>not</em> know CQL, so it provides simpler web-based interfaces where logic can be defined by filling out forms -- but does not allow authors to directly type in CQL (although it does allow CQL uploads).</p>
<p>If you need to author measures, the MAT really is a better choice for you.  If you're not able to get an account then perhaps you can install a local version?  Last time I checked, the MAT was open source software.</p>

<p>Hi, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191469">@Chris Moesel</span> !!! <br>
Thanks for responding! Definitely I'd like to try MAT as well, I didn't know it was open source.<br>
That is amazing idea. We are going to try it<br>
