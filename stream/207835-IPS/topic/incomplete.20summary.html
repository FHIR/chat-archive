<p>I was asked by an implementer for the appropriate action to take when creating an IPS from a back end data store that has errors or omissions. </p>
<p>The scenario is a FHIR facade in front of an EHR which produces an IPS document on request by (using a FHIR operation) retrieving data from the back end system and assembling the summary from that. If there is an issue assembling the summary due to issues in the underlying datastore (say a medication refers to a non-existent drug or there is an invalid value for some element) then what should be in the IPS? </p>
<p>I would imagine that there should be an OperationOutcome in the document describing the error but should this also be a Composition.section? (ie 'Errors assembling this summary')</p>
<p>Should there be a note in the section.text / composition.text that indicates that the contents may be incomplete?</p>
<p>Should the status response to the operation be something other than 200 (eg 206 - partial content)?</p>
<p>And with regard to the affected resource (say with an un-mappable value) then should the resource be simply omitted or should the data that can be retrieved be included, but something on the resource (say a tag) to indicate that it is incomplete? And/or text in the narrative explaining the omission</p>

<p>in the case of medication the code is "no-medication-info". So, if for any reason you are not able to fill the medication section a single MedicationStatement valued with a medicationCodeableConcept = no-medication-info has to be provided.</p>

<p>the 'no-medication-info' should not be mixed-up with the 'no-known-medications' that is the one that should be used to say no medications to report for the purpose of the IPS.</p>

<p>IMHO: OperationOutcome: yes. Mention it in the text: Yes. Status code on the operation being 206: sounds good. All of these are best practices when it comes to error handling and traceability. There's also a <a href="http://meta.security">meta.security</a> tag which can be used to label a resource as being 'unreliable'. </p>
<p>In terms of patient safety: is it better to have at least some information (clearly labelled as being partial) or to have no data at all ? What would more likely lead to clinical errors ?</p>

<p>Maybe I misunderstood the initial question :-) <br>
my answer was referring to the non-availability of information for a specific section.  <br>
A different situation is the case in which you may be aware that the list might be incomplete because - for example - one of the sources is not available. In this case you cannot use 'no-info' codes...</p>

<p>The IPS is in any case a summary and does not pretend to document all the possible patient data (it is by design partial). <br>
If and when to share a PS I believe it is a jurisdiction decision.<br>
There are countries in which the PS shall be human curated and/or validated: in this case, it is a professional evaluation if an incomplete summary can be shared or not.<br>
If it is automatically generated, I'd expect that rules are defined to determine the minimal content for disclosing the summary</p>

<p>I agree with Giorgio's and Rene's thoughts on this (and if I'm reading them correctly, I believe they should work together).  As Giorgio said, I think the decision to share (and probably also what specific data is shared) will ultimately be jurisdiction-specific, but likely also there should be some general guidance that we can and should share in the IG.  It seems that it's probably time for us to begin actively developing and compiling this for inclusion in future IG updates.</p>

<p>Key thing is that the EHR must generate a 'valid' document - so if missing/corrupt/untranslatable elements would cause the element to be invalid, then you may have to omit containing elements until you get to one that's optional - and the error, whatever it is, would need to be reflected in something human-readable at that point.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that including an OperationOutcome is going to be terribly human-friendly.  Most software that would spit out an OperationOutcome is going to be focused on conveying information to developers, less so to end-users.  And the convention of a list of issues with pointers into varying portions of the document doesn't seem terribly human-friendly to me.  I think it would be better to acknowledge errors/omissions/conversion issues as close to where they occur in a human-readable form than to have a summary in some separate section.  (Particularly because portions of the document might be hived off and incorporated into the record and an OperationOutcome in a separate section almost certainly wouldn't come along for the ride.)</p>

<p>I understand the technical constraint that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> is mentioning, but it seems this would result in missing information that could be supplied simply because it points at something that can't be supplied.

<p>Hi José, <br>
referring to the only real case of cross-border exchange of Patient Summaries I'm aware of (the EU case), this is not a feature supported.  <br>
An EU-PS can be exchanged X-border if a set of agreed rules are fulfilled. Agreed rules include also the data that shall, should or may be included in the EU-PS for cross-border exchange.</p>

<p>If this algorithm need is strong enough we can add it to the justifications for the Permission resource to model.

<p>The use of MASKED code would be logical on the data Resource that has been degraded. This is very much similar to the instructions under FHIR "Summary" to use SUBSETTED code to indicate the data has been reduced to just the summary elements.</p>

<p>The location of the codes for Obligations is not as obvious. This is where I prefer to put these obligations on the Bundle, as they are instructions associated with the interaction that caused the Bundle to exist, thus I see them existing on <a href="http://Bundle.meta.security">Bundle.meta.security</a>. To put obligation codes on the data Resources does not seem right, as the data has not yet been MASKED or that would be the code of interest.  However there is discussions that this plan to put obligations on the Bundle seems close to the dreaded context-conduction, which is forbidden in FHIR. I agree with the principle, but disagree that this is about context-conduction. It is a statement of "meta" about the "Bundle", therefore is <a href="http://Bundle.meta.security">Bundle.meta.security</a>...</p>

<p>I was thinking of the Permission that comes along with the resource, saying "these are the constraints the resource went through and that the resource is expected to follow whenever used"</p>

<p>BTW: The FHIR Validator reports an "Unknown Code System" error for <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/CodeSystem/absent-unknown-uv-ips">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/CodeSystem/absent-unknown-uv-ips</a></p>

<p>I didn't get that error with the IG Publisher when I built IPS this morning (and I'm sure I've never seen it for absent-unknown-uv-ips).  Maybe the validator is behaving differently?  We should look at an example.</p>

<p>I only get that error for the AllergyIntolerance Resource when used to populate the mandatory code element where there is no information (and the slicing in the IPS Profile definitely allows the use of that Code System in that element). </p>
<p>Using concepts from that Code System in Condition.code, MedicationStatement.Medication and Immunization.vaccineCode, on the entries created where there is no available information, doesn't upset the Validator.</p>

<p>Yeah, that seems odd.  It still might be good to look at your example that's giving the error.</p>
