<p>Hi <span aria-label="wave" class="emoji emoji-1f44b" role="img" title="wave">:wave:</span>. Looking through the IPS profiles, I see that the some of the  profiles for the <em>Diagnostic results</em> section  fix the <code>status</code> to be  "final"/"completed" (the corresponding profiles on Observation and Media). Other profileS used in this section (e.g. on Specimen or ImagingStudy)  or in other sectionS (e.g.on  Immunization, ImagingStudy, MedicationStatement or Observation) do <em>not</em> constrain the <code>status</code> field. What is the reasoning behind these differences? Having looked at the fixed-status profiles first, I initially thought fixing the status was a general principle reflecting the idea that a Patient Summary should only contain "finished &amp; known good" data , and no data that is unfinished, known to be incorrect etc. But that theory clearly does not hold up.</p>

<p>Typically status would be completed. Some more discussion on the status is here: <a href="http://international-patient-summary.net/mediawiki/index.php?title=IPS_implementationguide_1#Determining_the_Status_of_Clinical_Statement">http://international-patient-summary.net/mediawiki/index.php?title=IPS_implementationguide_1#Determining_the_Status_of_Clinical_Statement</a></p>

<p>Does it need to be fixed in the profiles? Maybe it's left to the sender to express something useful here, without constraints.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reference! - was an interesting read.  One key distinction I took away was that between the status of the data capture (a specific observation made at one particular point in time) vs. the status of what is being captured.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Status of the condition and related times</strong><br>
Each Observation contained by a Concern Act is a discrete observation of a condition. Its statusCode is always “completed” since it is the “status of the activity of observing, not the status of what is being observed”. <br>
Another aspect that became clearer to me on further research is that possible values for <code>status</code> differ significantly between resources. Thus, for MedicationStatement I understand you would want to be able to indicate both that the medicine is being taken ("active") or that it has been taken but no longer is ("completed").</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having said that, I  wouldn't say I can now completely understand the fix/non-fix choices in IPS (say, why <code>Specimen.status</code> is not fixed to "available").   I don't feel competent to say if this is something that should be changed in the profiles. However, I do think it would be very helpful to have a discussion of this in the IG, clarifying (1) what principles/distinctions are used when fixing <code>status</code> values, and (2) what expectations  (if any) there are for the status of the data put into the IPS, where not fixed - e.g. is non-final (or equivalent) expected to be an exception and, if so, for which cases?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194703">@Morten Ernebjerg</span>  if you are available we can talk about this in the today IPS call (<a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PC/IPS+2020-07-01">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PC/IPS+2020-07-01</a>) ; otherwise we can schedule for one of the following calls.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191415">@Giorgio Cangioli</span> Thanks for the ping, I'm afraid I will have no time today. But I would be happy to join on a later date if the input would be helpful (will be away on summer holiday until end of July, though). When would the next call be?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="194703">@Morten Ernebjerg</span>  the IPS project has weekly calls. I'll put this topic in the IPS parking lot.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191415">@Giorgio Cangioli</span>, I'll get in touch when I'm back to check where it might fit in</p>
