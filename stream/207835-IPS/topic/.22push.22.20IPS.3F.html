<p>I understand that we're in the process of specifying how IPS documents can be queried ($docref, $summary). Has the group discussed how IPS documents should be pushed?</p>

<p>It seems like a simple <code>POST /Bundle</code>would work, right? </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/documents.html#bundle">http://www.hl7.org/fhir/documents.html#bundle</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that <code>POST /Bundle</code> implies that the Bundle is persisted as is, and available to subsequent read and search interactions. I am not sure that there are many servers ready or willing to do that.</p>

<p>If the Bundle is persisted intact as a document bundle, I think that HAPI and many other servers shouldn't have any problem with that.  What we <strong>may</strong> need for IPS though, is some kind of "hybrid" behavior on a server, possibly where the document bundle could be persisted (or re-assembled without loss), <strong>plus</strong> the ability to also break down the bundle into its components that are available for secondary uses (e.g., generating a vaccine certificate or incorporating into the expected locations in an EHR?).  That would be custom behavior for IPS, but I don't see in principle why something like that couldn't be done.</p>

<p>Yeah, we've certainly been wondering about the receiving end of IPS. Lots of work going on with generating them and getting them into a patient's hands, but little discussion about what to do to get it back into a clinician's system. Do we expect the documents to be persisted as received, or document patient resources replaced with system patient resources, etc. We don't have an answer for any of this yet.</p>

<p>You can do that on my Server (Terminz) subject to the following...<br>
Bundle.Type == Bundle.BundleType.Document<br>
Composition.Type.coding.system="<a href="http://loinc.org">http://loinc.org</a>" and code="60591-5" <br>
Contains one Composition and one Patient Resource<br>
Contains at least one of each of these resources - AllergyIntolerance, Condition and MedicationStatement (or MedicationRequest).<br>
Includes at least one Patient.Identifier with populated system and value elements (these are used for persistence and $summary request purposes)<br>
Requests are via the patient/$summary operation <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32014">deferred to R6 by PA yesterday</a>.<br>
I don't support requests for the individual resources within the Composition.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191380">@Elliot Silver</span>  Yes, a work in progress (just beginning).  Likely to have at least a few possible answers.  And definitely time to be thinking about it.</p>
