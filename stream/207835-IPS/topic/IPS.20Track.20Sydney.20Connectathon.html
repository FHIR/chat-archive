<p>At the last WGM it was announced by IHE (in the meeting for reviewing the IPS Ballot) that a connectathon track was supposed to be scheduled about the IPS in Sydney. Does anyone know more about it? HL7 Germany would highly be interested in testing their national profiles which heavily rely on the IPS, especially mapping to other profiles that are derived from the IPS. Is anything planned for the IPS?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193430">@Alexander Zautke</span> I am a bit behind in submitting track proposals, but I'm still planning to do that today (discussed with Sandy Vance this morning).  If you have some specifics that you would like to have including in the IPS track submission send it to me as soon as you can.</p>

<p>Ah, perfect! Some issues around Observation.effective[x] in combination with the ips-1 constraint. As well, as a follow-up question about JIRA Ticket FHIR-23906.</p>
