<p>What clinicalStatus value should I use in a Condition, when the Condition.code is no-known-problems? ClinicalStatus has a min cardinality of 1, and Condition is required to be included in an IPS.  Is the lack of problems "active" or "inactive"?</p>

<p>Also, the analogous question for AllergyIntolerance: what clinicalStatus goes with a code of no-known-allergies?</p>

<p>I guessed "inactive" but none of the 3 available values are satisfactory in those contexts as their descriptions all refer to an "identified substance".</p>

<p>"active" means the "The subject is currently experiencing the condition or situation". no-known-problems is a "situation" that patient is current has/experiences. So my vote goes for "active"</p>

<p>I think that 'active' is the <strong>best</strong> of those choices - but it's not a good one.  This is something that we need to figure out.  We may need to bring this up with PCWG and change the cardinality to min=0 with an appropriate invariant.  That's actually already the case in the CI build for R5 with AllergyInterolerance, but not with Condition.</p>

<p>Might also want to ask this on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="294552" href="/#narrow/stream/294552-Patient-Care-WG">#Patient Care WG</a></p>
