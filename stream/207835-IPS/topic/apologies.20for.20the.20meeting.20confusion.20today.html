<p>Apologies for the problem with the original Zoom meeting today.  I'm not sure what happened, but I was unable to log in and start the meeting (and I double or triple checked the username/password).  But I am able to get into it now - so either it was a transient issue, or I screwed up! :(  Anyway, it's good that many of us were still able join.  I'll get the recording linked and will post that shortly, so any of you who missed it can review.</p>
