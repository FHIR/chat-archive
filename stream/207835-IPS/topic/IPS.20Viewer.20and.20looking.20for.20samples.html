<p>As mentioned during the kickoff, I've adapted a previous tool (developed by Diego Kaminker and Fernando Campos) for IPS viewing. Here's the link to it online: <a href="http://www.ipsviewer.com/">http://www.ipsviewer.com/</a> (please use for test samples only). Right now I've only checked out 2 sample IPS bundles in the tool, and there's certainly more work to do. If you can share links to a few more IPS samples in this thread, that would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi John I tried with two samples I had and this is the returned message "Invalid IPS - TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'reference')". I'll send you the samples .</p>

<p>I will take a look today and let you know. There were several reference complaints when I worked with a sample from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191364">@Peter Jordan</span> server yesterday, so definitely some things to iron out</p>

<p>I've asked John if he would show us where he is with the viewer during our Touchpoint session - which is starting now.  And he graciously agreed to do that. :)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191415">@Giorgio Cangioli</span> I have debugged and updated <a href="http://www.ipsviewer.com">http://www.ipsviewer.com</a> <br>
Those two samples you shared should now render to the viewer. The viewer was expecting a custodian, which is why it errored earlier. In addition, there was another thing I debugged on the display of ingredient information. I've added them to the repo, but please try them out and let me know what you think. I've also got a sample now from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191427">@Jens Villadsen</span> which I'll try to see if that's working next.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="196446">@Li-Hui Lee</span> I was looking at your sample. Right now, it looks like the immunizations section (11369-6) of your sample has references to 3 resources. The first is an Immunization Resource (urn:uuid:c220e36c-eb67-4fc4-9ba1-2fabc52acec4) which works fine for display. The second is a  ImmunizationRecommendation (urn:uuid:15d9e5d7-4c89-4e63-a523-efc4c442acfd) which isn't displaying. The third is a DocumentReference (urn:uuid:25f477da-8281-4201-b98b-3b142eb6c721) to a serialized QR code which isn't displaying. Should the second and third resources be included in the immunizations section? I will try to create an alert but right now the tool won't display immunization section with references to non immunization resources.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197638">@John D'Amore</span> Yes, you are right. <br>
I just spent time checking the example I provided to you. After I removed the second and third resources, the immunization resource was displayed. Also, I have read your modification. Thanks for your help and guidance! :)</p>
