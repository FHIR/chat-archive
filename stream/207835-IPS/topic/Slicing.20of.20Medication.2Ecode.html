<p>Hi,<br>
one question regarding slicing of Medication.code. In the  textual explanation there are described five levels of IDMP-codes, but these are not reflected in the build-profile for Medication. In the build profile there are only slices for atc and snomed. Is there are reason for this?</p>

<p>As IDMP is still developing, the five levels are anticipating the future logical structure of IDMP identifiers. But no practical use as of today.</p>

<p>Thank you Christof, so the plan might be to add slices as identifiers/ codes for the 5 IDMP levels are developed? Is there expected to be any guidance on what levels  of IDMP SNOMED CT-codes could be used?</p>

<p>I think it is SNOMED CT <em>instead</em> of IDMP identifiers, for the time being. In that sense, this is a valid question: should we use value sets of SNOMED codes to "simulate" the IDMP levels? And how would the slicing work in that case?</p>

<p>These slices gives the idea that ATC and SNOMED are for the time being the most reasonable solutions for cross-jurisdictions product identification, waiting for more widely usable product identifiers (IDMP)</p>

<p>based on the latest discussions the basic idea is that the IDMP identifiers will go in the medication.code, but since the cardinality is 1..1 they need to be represented into different codings. The question here is if they are actually representing the same concept... I hope this might be part also of the discussion in the UNICOM project (<a href="https://unicom-project.eu/">https://unicom-project.eu/</a>)</p>

<p>current guidance in FHIR is:<br>
"The concept may be coded multiple times in different code systems (or even multiple times in the same code systems, where multiple forms are possible, such as with SNOMED CT). Each coding (also referred to as a 'translation') is a representation of the concept as described above and may have slightly different granularity due to the differences in the definitions of the underlying codes.

<p>In my opinion, this (or several other cases),  are NOT slightly different granularity - these are completely different concepts - a PhPID and a PCID are really not a translation.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> isn't this the old well-known TERMINFO problem? i. e. choose between creating complex data structures to capture those different granularities vs. "hiding" the complexity in the code system?

<p>Slicing is a good choice. The thing that I am concerned is that the slicing is done on a data element that is (by its definition) meant to support translations, i.e. same granularity or slightly different</p>

<p>The slicing on Medication.code is on the element, and therefore at the CodeableConcept level.  So in an given instance, whichever slice (or no slice) is matched, multiple Codings can be included which can deal with the differences in granularity (even potentially "extreme" differences) as long as the overall meaning is the same (i.e. all of the Codings are representing the same "medication" [e.g. "penicillin"] at whatever "level" each code represents).</p>

<p>What we are doing is slicing on the 'code' element (a 1..1 non-repeating element, by the way), at the CodeableConcept data type level.  The slicing is <strong>not</strong> at the Coding level.  Multiple Codings, according to the usual rules, are allowed for any instance.</p>

<p>This is what I had in mind writing "more layers between codesystem and data elements". Let's say I have one data element 1..1 and I am using certain codes (ATC, or national etc.) to describe my concept, I am looking for a way to say "I am using this code from that codesystem with the following intention or implied meaning in relation to the given data element : <code>{ exact | broader | narrower | example | attribute | instance-of | similar-to | part-of | has-part | ... }</code>". Probably I am thinking of something like qualifiers or annotations, as it can be done within SNOMED per post-coordination. But how can it be done for ATC? Or for a national medication code? If such logic is implemented as an attribute of the slicing or of the value set binding, it is not visible to the receiver. <code>Coding.userSelected</code> is possibly just one specific example of such a "qualifier".</p>

<li>
<p>we can expect that all systems will understand from that PhPID L1 <strong>is broader than</strong> PhPID L4, or that PZN <strong>has really nothing to do with</strong> MPID...<br>

<p>at this moment we can create slices for a non-repeating element (I thought that was not kosher). <br>
I don't know what value we add by slicing .</p>

<p>I think the primary added value of this is visibility of the explicitly modeled choices.  It makes it easier to see that you can use a SNOMED code, or an ATC code, for example.  Or it could include one or more of the levels of the IDMP codes, if we want to make that explicit (we did pretty much have that in IPS at one point - but, as noted, IDMP isn't really "there" yet, so we removed that for now).  When there are separately modeled slices the choices seem much easier to see than if instead you simply create and bind to a value set including the content from all of the possible code systems (and in IDMP the multiple "levels" of the codes).  One aspect to consider is that If multiple Codings (with different terminologies and/or levels of granularity) are used in an element instance, as we've described, there is a risk (and likelihood) of having a particular instance match multiple slices.  That generally has been frowned upon, if not prohibited - but I think that actually the same considerations apply when the element is repeating, so I don't think this is (or it shouldn't be) necessarily a show stopper.</p>

<p>I am no sure I get why there is a likelihood of instances matching multiple slices. Lets say if you divide according to the 5 IDMP-levels, the granularity of the code will depend on the level that is expressed and all codes on that level will contain the details required by that level. An an instance will be categorized in the slice according to the level of detail. Or the instance might use a different code system like SNOMED or a national code system. How would an instance match multiple slices (unless one count that they are all more detailed descriptions of a pharmaceutical product)?</p>

<p>OK, my understanding is then that it would not be possible to have an instance satisfying multiple IDMP-level based slices. Unless you populate several levels on purpose because you dont know what the receiver can read? The same level of coding could also be represented in SNOMED CT, but there are maybe not so many instances that would populate both SNOMED CT and IDMP? On the other hand I expect a need for ATC to be used as a parallelle coding scheme in Norway, as this is basis for some reporting requirements.</p>

<p>It would be common to populate with multiple codings expressing different levels - not just because you might not know the recipient but because the same instance might be sent multiple places.  As a rule, you want to send the same information to everyone, not to have custom interfaces for each recipient.</p>

<p>So long as the code is a proper coding for the drug, the granularity can be very different - one code that says "Penicillin" and another that says "APO Amoxicillin 100mg caplets" and any concept between those granularities is completely fine to appear as alternate codings.  What you <em>can't</em> do is send a code that says "blue" and another code that says "oral" - because those aren't codings for the drug.</p>

<p>that is what I understand from our discussion last week - you can send largely variant codes - my comment is that the spec says this:<br>
Each coding (also referred to as a 'translation') is a representation of the concept as described above and may have slightly different granularity due to the differences in the definitions of the underlying codes. <br>
Those examples are not slightly different granularities. Am I misreading the spec?</p>

<p>Yes, that's right.  It can be confusing. "Penicillins" (or maybe "Penicillin-type drug") is a drug class, which does include Amoxicillin, but "Penicillin" is a specific drug in that class which is different from Amoxicillin.</p>

<p>I think that including a Coding for both the drug class and the specific drug in the same data type instance is really stretching the idea of the CodeableConcept to (and maybe beyond) the limits.  But various "levels" of description of a particular drug would generally be fine (in my opinion).  So you could have Codings for "Lisinopril" and "Lisinopril 10 mg tablet" and "Zestril 10 mg tablet bottle of 100" (or the equivalents), but if I want to also convey that they are in the drug class of "ACE inhibitors", I would do that separately.  That's my take.  I'm not entirely certain what Pharmacy is recommending on this, so I would be happy to hear from Melva or anyone else about that.</p>

<p>I should also add that when prescribing Penicillin as a drug (not the class), it's going to be specified as "Penicillin V" (typically Penicillin V potassium) or "Penicillin G" (as sodium, potassium, benzathine or procaine), so just stating "Penicillin" (singular) alone probably isn't sufficient and it normally wouldn't be used.</p>

<p>Sorry to come in to this late.  I was trying to understand the use case for including multiple levels of code in a single instance of medication.  As far as including ATC in a different attribute, there isn't another attribute in medication, but there is in medicationKnowledge.

You can use the MedicationKnowledge.medicineClassification attribute.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191759">@Melva Peters</span> - the discussion In Norway was related to whether ATC is a good fit for coding in Medication for use-cases like prescribing, dispensing that we are about to implement (like IPS), or if it would better be defined as an attribute (like form). To what extent do you support the argument that ATC could better be defined as an attribute in Medication?

<p>Yep, and the question is then, maybe somewhat philosophical - should classification in the Medication resourcce be coded in the same manner as product code (as it is done now), or would it be as good to put it in a separate attribute  (ex called classification) in the same way as is done for  MedicationKnowledge.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192654">@Øyvind Aassve</span> I don't believe that ATC is a good fit for coding for medication for prescribing and dispensing.  My understanding is that ATC is a classification system.  According to the WHO website "The purpose of the ATC/DDD system is to serve as a tool for drug utilization monitoring and research in order to improve quality of drug use."   There are 5 levels to the ATC hieararchy and the most granular level is "metformin" or "amoxicillin".  While this might be suitable for prescribing in some cases, it definitely isn't appropriate for dispensing.  Since this is a classification system, that's why I support it being an attribute in medication - it would need to be an extension as the medication resource has been stripped down to include only those attributes that we believed are necessary for prescribing, dispensing, administering medications.  The classification of the drug isn't one of those attributes.  It was included in MedicationKnowledge as it is information about a drug.  You can use the medication code to look up the medicationKnowledge to get the classification.</p>

<p>The degree of coding of a Medication isn't binary where you've got classifications and product codes.  Rather, it's a continuum from high level classifications down to very fine-grained codes.  It might be possible to get agreement on dividing those potential codes at the extremes, but it would be rather hard to do as you get into the middle.  It's not clear why there's a problem simply sending alternate codings.  If we split it in two, then people will argue that they need a high-level classification and a low-level classification or a general product code and a detail product code - essentially wanting a separate attribute for each level of categorization or coding they care about - and there's no way we're going there.</p>

<p>Right, and I don't think that the fact that levels are different is the main driver for separating. The main driver I'd consider is what has happened in recent projects - I think EPSOS, openMedicine (UNICOM is just starting) - that people will use that continuum to imply equivalence, or use only that for interoperability. Given that history (and the fact that people ATC and later we found out that ATC was not adequate as a drug identifier), I do support that classification (ATC, schedule etc) is not in the same place as product code(s) - at least for prescription and dispense. Product code uniquely identifies a concept, independently of how broad that concept is. ATC doesn't serve that purpose.</p>

<p>"Useful" is dependent on use-case.  Generally when it comes to medications you want a reasonably fine level of detail, but some use-cases just want high-level categorizations.  E.g. "Is the patient on an ace inhibitor? (Y/N)".  Because the objective with FHIR interfaces is to spit out the data that any consuming system might want, good practice is to share whatever codings you know at whatever level of granularity they exist.  Consuming clients will pay attention to those they find useful.</p>

<p>OK <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> , do I understand you correctly as in theory we can have some use-cases where ATC might be useful as concept identifier, in other use-cases not. The next question then is if the profiles should reflect this, they should place ATC  accordingly - in either an extension or as a coded element - depending on the use-case? If so - in the context of this stream another follow-up question could be what would be the right approach for IPS?  Or would it be better to desribe this in the same way in all FHIR-profiles, so that ATC is always put in code - even if in the applicable use-case it would have been better to put it as an extension - in order to drive more large-scale consistency across Medication-profiles.</p>

<p>In following and thinking though this later part of the discussion, I think we should go back to how the element itself is defined.  In this case, Medication.code is defined as "A code (or set of codes) that specify this medication ...".  So, if the ATC code is being used in the system to specify (i.e. select, identify, etc.) the medication (for prescribing, dispensing, etc. ), then it should be appropriate to include as one of the Codings, as Lloyd has said.  If it's being used in another way, then possibly it shouldn't be included there (would want to see actually how it's being used in that case).</p>

<p>From an outsiders perspective on IPS - I am thinking patient summary is possibly not the most problematic use-case with regards to the use of ATC. It is a summary of historic medications given a patient, and I dont see a big problem if an ATC-code tags along. It gives the clinican an idea of the medication the patient has used. However, in Norway, IPS is now being used as a template for Medication-profiles that are more directly targeted towards prescrption and dispensing, and for those use-cases ATC is not ideal for identifying medications.</p>

<p>I guess it probably would be good to say that the reason that there currently is an explicit slice for atcClass on Medication.code in the IPS Medication profile is that it has been felt that there <strong>are</strong> ATC codes available at a sufficient level of granularity to be useful to represent the medications that a patient is taking (i.e. prescribed/dispensed), in the context of a patient summary.  That is consistent with the statistics that Christof provided on the ability of ATC to represent the "clinical drug".  Another factor for explicitly including it in IPS is that ATC happens to be one of the few reasonably comprehensive medication terminologies that is currently available and is (at least potentially) usable globally.</p>

<p>I'd think, based on what I saw in previous projects: ATC was used because there was nothing else before IDMP. Depending on the use cases, adding ATC cn be useful of absolutely useless. So we just provided whatever information we had, hoping it would be useful (that is what I understand from the use of ATC which AFAIK was designed for monitoring purposes, not for clinical purposes).</p>

<p>Not sure this is agreeable: <br>
ATC does not intend to have granularity to identify medications - it does identify the part of the body that is targeted and the therapeutic mechanism. that is it - it is just additional information. The fact that it is coded information does not mean it is a product code.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of the ATC/DDD system is to serve as a tool for drug utilization monitoring and research in order to improve quality of drug use.</p>

<p>So <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> you are quite correct that ATC was designed for monitoring and research, but I guess I would say that does not entirely mean that it "was not meant to identify medications" - as to be able to monitor their usage it must be able to identify them (at some level).  And, I do agree, that in large part in IPS (and elsewhere) you are exactly right that ATC was used "because there was nothing else before IDMP" - and I might add that there still isn't, because IDMP isn't actually "real" yet.  And the other potential alternative of using SNOMED CT is not feasible globally (at least not yet) due to the licensing issues, as the number of drugs needed to sufficiently represent clinical practice is far too large for the full set or any reasonable subset to ever be included in the GPS.</p>

<p>I don't mind this minor disagreement (and it's my spider sense that is causing me to amplify this), but for correction if appropriate: <br>
I'm not a pharmacist but I learned that ATC classifies where the drugs work in the body and the mechanism of action. <br>
There are drugs without ATC classification, drugs with several ATC classifications, or drugs whose ATC classifications change (<a href="https://www.whocc.no/atc/application_for_atc_alterations/">https://www.whocc.no/atc/application_for_atc_alterations/</a>)</p>

<p>I think you have to be careful about the multiple codings so that they imply the same thing.  I don't think you want a set of codes included where one code is Penicillin (using ATC) and one code is Amoxicillin 250mg (using SNOMED-CT) and one code is Amoxil 250mg capsule by GlaxoSmithKline - while they are related, they clearly are not the same.    I'm with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> on this one - I don't think ATC is a good fit for identification of medication for the purposes of prescribing and dispensing - that isn't the intent  of it from what I understand.  Its the same argument about why ICD isn't a good fit for diagnosis - it is a classification system.  If you need to include the classification, it should be in a different attribute - so in Medication it would be an extension or you use the medication.code to look up the MedicationKnowledge.</p>

<p>They don't have to be the same.  They just have to be appropriate codings of the medication in their respective code system.  It's no different than allowing ICD9, ICD10 and SNOMED codes for diagnoses in the same element.  The granularity might be quite different, but they are all coding "what is the condition" within their respective code systems.  There is <em>zero</em> expectation that multiple codings within a CodeableConcept will reflect the same granularity.</p>

<p>One thing that this discussion is making me think we really should consider is, let's say using MedicationRequest.medication did I order an "ACE inhibitor" or a "Lisinopril 10 mg tablet" (for example)?  I guess you could try to infer that based on assuming that the most granular (detailed) code is what was actually ordered, but that doesn't seem very satisfying or necessarily reliable or even possible.  You could also look for userSelected on one of the Codings, but that might not be populated at all (I'm not getting the sense that it's been very popular so far), or if it is populated it might not be reliable (if it's populated on the wrong Coding or more than one Coding then it would be of no actual value).</p>

<p>Right.  I think that illustrates, though, that we need to consider how far is reasonable to go with the notion of "translation".  As <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191832">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> already quoted, the CodeableConcept spec says (emphasis mine) "Each coding (also referred to as a 'translation') is a representation of the concept as described above and may have <strong>slightly</strong> different granularity due to the differences in the definitions of the underlying codes".  "Slightly" may actually be stating it somewhat too narrowly, but I don't think we should go so far as to interpret that to mean "any degree of".  Each individual Coding should be a reasonably faithful representation of the intended meaning of the concept, as expressed in its particular terminology (normally choosing the most specific matching code available).  So if I'm prescribing Lisinopril 10 mg tablet and I am going to include an ATC code in addition to whatever other code(s) I may have, then I think the expected choice would be 'C09AA03' for "lisinopril", rather than 'C09AA' for "ACE inhibitors, plain" (or anything at a higher level than that).</p>

I believe the expectation is for the International Patient Summary to be used inside a country and across borders.<br>

<p>OK, good, as we also discussed earlier - to me there seems to be a need to make profiles domain specific . What is appropriate in a summary might not be appropirate for other use cases that might require more detail. This is what we are doing in Norway differing between base profiles - national profiling that applies to all use of a resource on national level - and domain profiles - national profiling that applies to a certain context - ex summary, prescription, exchange between EHR and charting systems etc. But it is interesting to ponder the cross-dependencis - what effects, if any, will a choice done for a summary use-case influence a lets say prescripton use-case.</p>

<p>My starting point on this is: By default, nothing about the medication in a summary is  appropriate for other uses. because summary removes details by design. <br>
In other words, inappropriate until proven OK.  Which is why I'm not surprised if summary stays with ATC - having ATC can alert the physician that there is something.</p>

<p>I'm finding other questions about using ATC and similar high-level enough concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>At some point, too high-level concepts don't serve much of a purpose any more - For example if there is an ATC code J07BX02 for Covid-19 vaccine, that only says "this person took something against covid" - you really cannot follow whether it was RNA, or virus vaccine. </li>
<li>Conversely, to me there's a difference between saying "this person did not take any vaccine for covid" and "this person did not take this RNA vaccine for covid" - and expressing those as code translations is not giving me that distinction.</li>

<p>I agree this could be handled with national SCT extensions, but this requires a huge maintenance job (as there will be very many products and packages in each country). My other question was when it is expected that IDMP will these kind of identifiers. If there will be a different set of MPIDS for IDMP they would have to be mapped to SNOMED CT and these maps needs to be continuously maintained. My understanding is aslo that the SPOR database also will contain all products on national level, so that this new IDMP identifier will be much more efficient than using SNOMED CT ....</p>

<p>My understanding is, that SNOMED is partner in the UNICOM project and involved directly in two WPs.</p>

<p>My understanding is also that SNOMED is involved, but I'm not particularly clear at the moment about the nature and extent of their current and anticipated involvement.  It would be good to have a clearer picture of that.   I can try to do some inquiry on the SNOMED side, but anything about it that anyone is able to pass along would be good to have.</p>

<p>UNICOM is a valueable reference. The question might be what is the best strategy with regards to taking decisions at the current time - as the UNICOM project still as I understand it is in its early infancy. If it is very likely that IDMP identifiers will be used for MPIDs - it might be not the best investment to convert all you products and packages to SNOMED CT.</p>

<p>The update I gave was from UNICOM. (actually <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="235766">@Julie James</span>). <br>
I haven't read the documentation yet, but if SCT supports the same concepts as MPIDs and PCIDs, then wither SCT adopts those codes (hardly) or indeed a mapping would be necessary.</p>

<p>Hence my first reaction - i expect these codes to be mastered at country level, and I do not see a reason why SCT would map them to a common set of codes - would be easier for some agency to just maintain the set of codes for the countries, insteading of adding one more code set.</p>

<p>Wow - what a lot of text to describe the age old problem of blending together the terminology model and the information model,  particularly where one is basic and the other is detailed.  Everything is solvable, but probably not on a Zulip chat, despite the constant desire for that to be the case.  I can explain both IDMP and SNOMED options, plus how they work together.....if anyone wants the detail, please reach out directly</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="235766">@Julie James</span> - I guess my main curiousity for now is a ballpark perspektiver on when a set of IDMP MPIDs could be expected to be ready. And is the hash algorithm approach to produce them still the planned way to go?</p>

<p>I think the ATC can play a useful role in identifying what something IS (it's chemistry) so that drug-to-drug interactions can be detected. What a medicine's GTIN is indicates manufacturer's product right down to the packaging level (different pack size of identical drug... different GTIN). Different manufacturer's make functionally equivalent products with different trade names... but made out of the same active ingredients. These would have the same ATC codes, as I understand it. For this reason, I think the ATC code adds a useful bit of value to the medicationStatement in the IPS.</p>

<p>All classifications do add value. I think ATC should not be mistaken with a product code for different GTINs. ATC is much coarser than that. Fortunately we (will (eventually)) have IDMP to bring additional codes.</p>

<p>Is there a more recent thread on this topic?</p>
<p>This thread addresses questions about 1) slicing an element with a cardinality of 1 (as I see it, creating a "choice" structure) and  2) how widely the granularity of codes can vary in a CodeableConcept. I'm interested in #2.</p>
<p>I don't think I see a clear consensus on that question. Conceptually, it seems that ATC and NDC could both be used, the NDC to identify the medication in the workflow and the ATC for reference or classification. I also think the concern about using such a broad code in, e.g., an order or dispense, is significant. Is it reasonable to think we can assert rules about using the most specific code, not the first code you can resolve, or about context of use (allow ATC on historical query results including orders, not on order placement)?</p>
<p>I have a case for a historical query where the classification would be useful, and where the instantiation of MedicationKnowledge seems heavy. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span>  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191759">@Melva Peters</span></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191985">@Jay Lyle</span> I don't know if there is a more recent thread (i'm not recalling one).  I think I would say a couple of things: (1) Use the code that most precisely represents the meaning that you want to convey (within the limits of the codes that you have available - based on whatever particular constraints may apply in your situation); (2) Include all of the appropriate codes that you know.  In most medication cases, I think that both ATC and NDC would probably fit within #2.  For ordering, as long as you send a specific code that, along with the other information model attributes, accurately specifies the item that you intend to order and that your ordering system can appropriately respond to, it would be acceptable (and maybe in some cases desirable) to also include a classification code (e.g, ATC).  I don't think it needs to be exclusive in that regard.  Also, carrying that a bit farther, it might <strong>even</strong> be possible to design an ordering system using "classification" codes, provided that the additional required specificity for the ordered item is being properly encoded via the other information model attributes (i.e. "post coordination" in the information model).</p>
