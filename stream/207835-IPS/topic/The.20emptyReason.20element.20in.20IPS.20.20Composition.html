<p>The description of the Composition.section.emptyReason in the International FHIR profile shows that it serves for the first layer section sitting in the composition. <br>
However, The Invariant affecting both  Composition.section.entry and Composition.section.emptyReason<br>
(<a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/composition-definitions.html#Composition.section.emptyReason">https://hl7.org/fhir/composition-definitions.html#Composition.section.emptyReason</a><br>
RuleA section can only have an emptyReason if it is emptyemptyReason.empty() or entry.empty()<br>
)<br>
has not been conformed in the IPS profile properly. <br>
(<a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/StructureDefinition-Composition-uv-ips-definitions.html#Composition.section.entry">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/StructureDefinition-Composition-uv-ips-definitions.html#Composition.section.entry</a><br>
ele-1: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (: hasValue() or (children().count() &gt; id.count()))<br>
)<br>
This issue needs a discussion in the IPS working group.</p>
<p>Here are a few points to bring to the conversation.</p>
<p>First, the emptyReason element should be added in the section:All Slices in the IPS Composition with its full description.</p>
<p>Second, how to handle and address the relationship between the mandatory sections and the emptyReason element in the IPS Composition?  ( emptyemptyReason.empty() or entry.empty() ).</p>
<p>This request comes from the PS_CA case. In that, the emptyReason element is used to handle the challenge of the IPS adoption with the relaxation of the mandatory sections.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197272">@Thomas Zhou</span>  Currently in the IPS Composition profile we have constrained out the use of Composition.section.emptyReason.  We had some recent discussion about whether to revisit that - but I <strong>think</strong> that we decided to keep it constrained out as it is now.  The cmp-2 invariant comes from the base Composition resource, not the IPS Composition profile - and in this case emptyReason.empty() always will be true, so the invariant is satisfied.  I assume that you are seeing the same thing?</p>

<p>Hi Rob, Thank you for your help.<br>
If it has to relax the mandatory sections of the composition in the PS_CA case, can we only keep and use the display element as an alternative to the EmptyReason element?<br>
I look forward to your comment.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197272">@Thomas Zhou</span> .. not sure to have understood what you are proposing. <br>
But the expectation is that implementers provide in any case an entry with a "no infos" or a "not known" code . E.g an AllergyIntolerance resource with a 'no-allergy-info' code    (No information about allergies)</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span> this is what I recall as well.<br>
The current build has however <code>emptyReason</code> 0..1 and no more 0..0 as it was in the published version. <br>
.. to be discussed in one of the next calls...</p>

<p>Oh, ok.  That's the issue.  I'll need to see if I can find what we last discussed in the minutes/recordings (I don't recall exactly what the date or dates might have been at the moment).<br>
