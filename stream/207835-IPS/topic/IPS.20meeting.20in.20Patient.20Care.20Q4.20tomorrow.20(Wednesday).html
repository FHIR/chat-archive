<p>Hi, everyone.  This is somewhat late-breaking news.  The HL7 Working Group Meeting is happening this week, and we won't be having our usual 11:00 AM ET IPS call tomorrow (Wednesday).  However, for those who are attending the WGM (everyone else gets a week off!) we have now scheduled a quarter for an IPS update and ongoing discussion and further work in the Patient Care session during Q4 tomorrow (3:30 - 5:00 PM EDT / 19:30 - 21:00 UTC).  Please join if you can (and we'll plan to catch everyone else up next week)!</p>
