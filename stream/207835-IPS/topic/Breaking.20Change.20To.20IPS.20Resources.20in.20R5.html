<p>I'm wondering if the Primary IPS Editors - <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191415">@Giorgio Cangioli</span>  &amp; <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192504">@François Macary</span> - or contributors have collective or individual views on a major breaking change to one of the required resources in the R4 version of the IPS Implementation Guide? </p>
<p>The renaming of the MedicationStatement Resource to MedicationUsage, and the related constraining of its scope**, may represent a major barrier for implementers wishing to move to R5; particularly if international uptake of the R4 version of the IPS IG reaches the targets set by the GDHP/ONC Project (i.e. 10 countries by the end of 2021 and a further 10 by the end of 2022). </p>
<p>**The reduction in scope is illustrated by a comparison of the Status Codes available in R4 (active | completed | entered-in-error | intended | stopped | on-hold | unknown | not-taken) with those available in R5 (completed | entered-in-error | unknown) - noting that the binding strength to the related Value Set is required.</p>

<p>We've certainly been aware of the change to the resource name.  But I'm not aware that we've actually had any specific discussion about the change in the resource scope (at least as that is reflected in the status value set), so it's good that you're raising the issue.  I guess that the main question to answer is if the status of the medication itself (not the recording status only) and the specific set of codes that were removed from the value set (active | intended | stopped | on-hold | not-taken) is needed in the patient summary context?  We definitely need to be discussing this and it would be great to hear any thoughts.</p>

<p>In R5, it's clear that MedicationUsage doesn't convey <em>any</em> information about what's prescribed/authorized, including time period for authorization and status of authorization, only what's actually taken.</p>

<p>The R5 status codes seem a little confusing to me. In R4, the code "completed" meant that the medication is no longer being taken. But in R5, the same code refers to the status of the <em>recording of medication intake</em> (def:  "The action of recording the medication statement is finished."). On the other hand, the code "unknown" still refers to the status of the <em>usage itself</em> (def: "The state of the medication usage is not currently known."). </p>
<p>I think it will be crucial to understand if the R5 codes are meant to give the status of the recording or of the intake itself. If it is the latter, then it seems to me this would have an impact on IPS - e.g. with the three current R5 codes, there seems to be no way of saying the intake is ongoing. If the former, how can one then indicate the status of the intake (ongoing vs. completed) in R5, is it only via the time interval?</p>

<p>The meaning of status has completely shifted in R5.  It's now a status of the 'record', not the status of the patient's behavior.  (Might be best to not use 'completed' as a code in R5 to avoid confusion though - you could submit a change request.)  What the patient is doing is now reflected in MedicationUsage.adherence.</p>

<p>I've pushed back against this change in a <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-31968">Jira Ticket</a> linked to  a negative vote for the R5 Ballot. </p>
<p>IMO, this attempt to constrain the number of use cases for Medication Lists should be done via profiling of the R4 MedicationStatement resource by implementers whose requirements only have to satisfy those use cases - but they do NOT represent the whole, worldwide community.</p>
<p>Clinicians, informaticians and consumer representatives in NZ have made it very clear that they required medication summaries that include prescribing and dispensing activity as well as administrations.</p>

<p>MedicationRequest is for single orders. If all you require is a list of orders, all well and good. However, many of our use cases  - some from well-established national HIE systems - go well beyond a list of orders.  These require what's been ordered, dispensed and administered for a patient, over a set period of time, in a single list and that IS feasible using MedicationStatement in R4. So why remove that capability from R5?</p>
<p>If anyone working on a National e-Prescription Service has never been asked for a list that compares what been prescribed, dispensed and taken - for the purposes of medicines reconciliation  (e.g. when attempting to decease the risks of polypharmacy in the elderly) - then I can almost guarantee you that, sooner or later, they will.</p>

Re. adherence/intake status. Thanks for the pointer, that would cover some aspects of it. However,  I was mainly thinking about documenting the intake instructions themselves, rather than whether the patient is sticking to them For instance, MedicationUsage still aims to cover the use case where "[the patient] will be taking the medication in the future". In R4, you could then use the status code "intended", even if you could not supply any dates. How would you represent that in R5 if you do not have a concrete time interval in the future to put in <code>effective[x]</code>?</p>

<p>I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191364">@Peter Jordan</span> that the R4 MedicationStatement meets the needs for IPS (as the "single list" that he described), but the more restricted proposed R5 MedicationUsage in its current state will not.  So this is clearly an issue that we do need to address for IPS.</p>

<p>MedicationRequest isn't only for single orders.  It's not limited to orders at all.  MedicationRequest.intent can be plan and recommendation - and can be used to summarize the intent for a patient to take medication that spans many orders</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> I think that you are missing my point. What is required is a resource that facilitates a singe list of what's been prescribed, dispensed and administered to a patient.

<p>You can't have a single resource that conveys both "what's ordered" and "what's actually happening" - those are two different statements with two different stets of state machines.  MedicationStatement was munging them together and causing lots of confusion about what was supposed to go where and implementers were using it for things it wasn't intended to be used for.  R5 makes things crystal clear - MedicationRequest for what's authorized/planned/intended; MedicationUsage for what's actually happening.  Many use-cases will indeed require both.</p>

<p>With MedicationStatement we often had some systems conveying "reported" prescriptions and "overall therapies" in MedicationStatement and others doing the same thing in MedicationRequest - and that's not useful.  Also, there were complaints about the inability to differentiate "dose being taken" from "dose authorized" in MedicationStatement - when it was never intended to convey the latter.</p>

<p>As you correctly stated, the choice we made in the IPS was to try to keep things as possible simple and provide a way to list the medications taken or supposed to be taken, irrespective by the fact this information is obtained by a list of prescribed, dispensed or other kinds of medications.<br>
This is what the MedicationStatement supported.</p>

<p>A different topic might be instead if we'd like to consider to "extend" the medication summary to other kinds of medication resources for better support the automatic generation of IPS by systems natively managing FHIR prescriptions, administrations or dispensations. (Partially supported also now because the slice is open).<br>
This without losing however the current option: one resource covering everything. <br>
But this is separate topic to be better analysed.</p>

<p>It's very easy to say that - but maybe not quite so easy in practice! MedicationStatement is a required element in the R4 IPS and worldwide usage is likely to be extensive by the time that R5 is finally published.</p>

<p>Wanting a single resource doesn't make it a requirement.  There are lots of situations where we might <em>like</em> all data to be in a single resource but need to access more than one.  You can certainly ballot the change in R5, but this change has been driven by a LOT of implementer discussion and a strong desire to eliminate confusion and drive consistency.  Combining "what's authorized" and "what's actually happening" into a single resource turns out to be a bad idea in practice - because a lot of the things you want to be able to say - about status, dose, start and end date, etc. are actually <em>different</em> for the authorization and "what's happening" aspects.  Also, if you're dealing with two statuses, then in FHIR terms, that generally means "two resources".  The fact that IPS will be widely implemented won't change that.</p>

<p>I've been following the thread from the beginning, and all I can discern is "We had this shiny widget, and we used it in a certain way, and we want to keep using it exactly in that way."</p>
<p>I have no doubts that</p>

<p>medication summaries that include prescribing and dispensing activity as well as administrations</p>

<p>is a real need. I just can't connect it to the insistence that it all has to be represented as a single resource. Is it not possible to use a combination of MedReq, MedAdmin, and MedUsage together to create a comprehensive medication summary? If there are missing pieces, what are they?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> - what particularly experience tells you that it's a bad idea to retain a widely-implemented resource that facilitates a comprehensive medication summary?</p>
<p>Is it <a href="http://www.hl7.org/ccdasearch/templates/2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.2.1.1.html">the Medication Section in C-CDA?</a>...</p>
<p>"The Medications Section contains a patient's current medications and pertinent medication history. At a minimum, the currently active medications are listed. An entire medication history is an option. The section can describe a patient's prescription and dispense history and information about intended drug monitoring.</p>
<p>This section requires either an entry indicating the subject is not known to be on any medications or entries summarizing the subject's medications."</p>
<p>Furthermore, adding a resource called MedicationUsage when there is one already called MedicationAdministration is far more likely to cause confusion and '2 statuses = 2 FHR resources' - really? We'd have a 1,000 resources if that rule were to be applied.</p>

<p>There are <em>very</em> few resources that have multiple statuses.  A couple of those we're looking at splitting.  Others are talking about orthogonal aspects of the same action.  Here, we're talking about two completely separate actions - what's authorized and what's being taken - each action having a number of characteristics that are specific to that distinct action.  MedicationStatement wasn't meeting the full use-case because there was no way to distinguish the state of the authorization from the state of what the patient was actually doing.  Also, there was overlap because MedicationRequest was intended to cover all use-cases related to "what's supposed to happen", so there were systems trying to cover exactly the same use-cases using different resources.</p>

<p>I'm going to take a forensic look at the status codes in the medication resources in R4 and R5. This isn't an academic exercise, I have two major NZ implementations to consider - i.e. mapping the entire NZePS Data Model to FHIR and the( C-CDA like) Medication Profile from our GP2GP Data Model to the IPS.</p>
