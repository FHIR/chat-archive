<p>This is a very interesting current <a href="#narrow/stream/179177-conformance/topic/must-support.20when.20re-profiling">discussion</a> about mustSupport in the conformance stream - which I think will be very germane to what we want to look at and hopefully decide on for IPS on our call tomorrow.  So, if you have a chance, please try to read through all or most of it if you can before the call.  And feel free to post any comments or questions on it related to IPS here in the meantime.</p>

<p>That thread is massive. I think this is the most relevant bit:</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it a requirement to derive from the profile with the MustSupport flags? If not, could you copy-paste the differential and then delete the MustSupports you don't need?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what we've done on the Canadian IPS variant--the actual IPS MS flags are too restrictive, so rather than derived profile of IPS, we've developed parallel profiles that let you conform to IPS but don't require it.</p>
