<p>Hello <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191415">@Giorgio Cangioli</span> </p>
<p>Looking for clarification on the Condition.code element (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition-Condition-uv-ips.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition-Condition-uv-ips.html</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If providing data for the element:<br>
     If a condition is present, is must be drawn from the required IPSGPCode ValueSet.  Please confirm<br>
     No other free text or code from another ValueSet can be used. Please confirm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to use the second slice absent or unknown problem. Is is that I have to use either slice?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Joel Francis</p>

<p>My understanding is that this slice is the same as an extensible binding on a combined valueset of the two value sets in the slices.<br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="193795">@Joel Francis</span> Sorry for not getting to this until now.  I basically agree with what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191506">@Yunwei Wang</span> said - except that I think it would be better to describe it as "the slices are functionally equivalent to" (rather than "this slice is the same as").  So it would read as "My understanding is that the slices are functionally equivalent to an extensible binding on a combined valueset of the two value sets in the slices."</p>
<p>And I think this is pointing out further that presentation of this using slicing isn't really as clear as I have been imagining it to be.  We definitely need this to be clear for the IPS implementer community, so we need to be presenting it in a simple and straightforward way.</p>

<p>So the answer to question #1 is no, it isn't required to draw a code from either of the value sets bound in the slices (as it functions similar to "extensible", as Yunwei said).  And the answer to question #2 is not that you have to, but that you <strong>can</strong> use a code from either slice (or a code that isn't in either of the slices if you need to).</p>

<p>Actually, I just also realized that actually the behavior is more like a "preferred" binding (rather than "extensible"), as there are no conformance expectations that you must use a code from either of the defined slices.  We're hoping to be able to tighten that when needed (e.g. the "cross border" profiles) in the STU update, but that's not the case in the published version.</p>

<p>Thanks  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191506">@Yunwei Wang</span> . As per what you have clarified. Does it break FHIR compliance and Semantic compliance to have a code like "Free_text" and populate the text filed of the CodeableConcept with non-coded data?</p>

<p>No, that's also legal, at least technically (whether it is very good vocabulary practice is another matter).  As you know we're working on determining the "best" way to do that in the updated version.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span> . While relaxing the bindings where "required" breaks FHIR compliance, Is is possible to add additional slices where needed? </p>
<p>I realize that adding extra slices may not break FHIR compliance, in certain cases additional critical data may be part of these slices and may be ignored if receiving systems require a pure IPS.</p>

<p>Yes, this slicing is "open" which means new slices can be added.</p>

<p>I read the profile as also saying that implementers must support those slices, whatever "must support" is defined to mean. And there is no guidance on the need for implementers to support values of code that meet neither slice.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span> . As advised, code from other ValueSet could be used. Would you please advise how we can present the codes from other ValueSet in IPS format?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="466166">@Flora Chan</span> We're going to try to clean this up further in the specification and give a better and more complete explanation in the updated version that we are working on to publish soon (now we're targeting that for January, following the Connectathon and WGM).  I'm happy to provide any further advice that you need (and others following the IPS stream here are, as well).  Maybe working through a specific example would make that clearer and easier?</p>
