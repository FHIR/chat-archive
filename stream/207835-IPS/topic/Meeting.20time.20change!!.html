<p>Hi, everyone.  I've had a change in my schedule that just came up this afternoon (my time), and now I have a conflicting recurring meeting every other week at our usual IPS meeting time - and that begins tomorrow!  So, even at this last moment, I'm proposing that we move the time of the call tomorrow up by 2 hours, to 9:00 AM EST (14:00 UTC) - right before the IPA call.  Then when we meet tomorrow we can discuss what will be the best plan for the calls going forward.  Sorry for the confusion, and I hope to talk with most or all of you tomorrow at 9:00 AM Eastern!</p>

<p>On our call last week we agreed that we would change the time of our calls to 9:00 AM ET through Jan. 5 - and then we would re-evaluate that during the January WGM.  The only problem with that idea is that I didn't get that change made to the call series on the HL7 calendar - so right now our call for tomorrow is on the calendar at the previous time of 11:00 AM ET.  I can make the call at that time tomorrow, and our usual time is better for some of us.</p>
<p>So, given this situation and to avoid further sudden changes, I'm proposing that we have our IPS call tomorrow at 11:00 AM ET and that we give ourselves one more week to decide what we want to do going forward.  In case anyone is already planning to join at 9:00 AM and doesn't see this beforehand, I'll also plan to open up the meeting at 9:00 - if anyone else does join then we can have some further more informal discussion.  And apologies for sending this so late in the day (particularly for Europe)  - I've been trying to get it sent all day, but I'm now finally able to get that done.</p>
