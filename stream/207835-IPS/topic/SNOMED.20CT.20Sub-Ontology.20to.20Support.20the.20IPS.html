<p>I thought this was already the case?</p>

<p>The IPS sub-set for non-member countries only has the SCTID, Active status, FSN and preferred (US English) term. It doesn't contain any of the relationships which provide the full value of the ontology.</p>

<p>Yes, it is interesting.  And I wasn't aware that it was coming.  The next question is, how should/can we use it - in the IPS IG(s) and more generally?  We'll need to give this some thought.</p>

<p>I’d recommend to keep referencing the GPS, while embracing the new visibility of the IPS concepts as a GPS-component that can be developed, explained and curated as a separate entity.</p>
