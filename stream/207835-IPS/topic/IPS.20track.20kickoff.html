<p>Thanks Rob for a great kickoff! For those interested to discuss IPS workflow, we'll be on a call tomorrow @9am CT (10am ET) and that Zoom link is on the IPS Track page (https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=81004083)...if you'd like an invite for calendar, just DM me. </p>
<p>In terms of leading a discussion on Must Support within IPS, we've been working on that. I shared a presentation regarding a few weeks ago (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hopNZWY57AUB7qlpmSinrCiTHtmtkELgZJVjL5-jE_g/edit#slide=id.p">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hopNZWY57AUB7qlpmSinrCiTHtmtkELgZJVjL5-jE_g/edit#slide=id.p</a>). I would propose setting up time tomorrow afternoon (1pm or 3pm CT)</p>
