<p>The requirements of CodeableConcept.text in the IPS CodeableConcept profile say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The codes from the terminologies do not always capture the correct meaning with all the nuances of the human using them, or sometimes there is no appropriate code at all. <em>In these cases, the text is used to capture the full meaning of the source.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(emphasis mine.)</p>
<p>However, the comments field says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The text should be at the displayName level and not on this level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pushing text down to displayName negates the value of using a CodeableConcept rather than a Coding--the ability to express things that could have a coded value, but for which we don't currently have that value. It also means only systems that can fully provide coded content can generate IPS. Is that the intent? (I recognize that this is a should, not a shall--was that also intended?)</p>
