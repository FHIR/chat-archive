<p>RE: Trying to reduce query burden - or reduce number of queries required to fetch a Patient with all Medications and related resources like Conditions. <br>
So far this is a dry hole as far as using standard FHIR options. </p>
<p>Option 1:  Patient$everything - <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/patient-operation-everything.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/patient-operation-everything.html</a><br>
This works and is well supported by many servers. However it returns everything related to the patient which can be a lot of extra data. </p>
<p>Option 2: Patient$everything using the _type filter parameter<br>
This would be perfect, allows you to specify an explicit list of the Resource types you want included in the return. However this doesn't appear to be well supported - HAPI doesn't appear to support it for instance. Likely most EMRs would not either, might not even support $everything</p>
<p>Option 3: Issue requests using the _include _revinclude search parameters<br>
_include and _revinclude can only be specified for defined resource search parameters. <br>
MedicationXXX.reasonReference is not a searchable attribute for any of the MedicationXX resources.</p>

<p>So we're back to, I think, using Patient$everything and potentially getting a large payload or using a custom client to fetch things one by one and chasing the links to construct a Bundle with the relevant resources in it. I think I'd likely rather use Patient$everything and filter it client side, but either way there is effort involved with the client.</p>
