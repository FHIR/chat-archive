<p>The CARIN Alliance will host a free Virtual Testing Event on <strong>November 11th from 10 am – 6 pm ET.</strong> The Testing Event will focus on testing the CARIN IG for Blue Button® and the CARIN IG for Digital Insurance Card. We will hold an Information Session to provide an overview of the Testing Event and will answer a number of questions that might be helpful as you prepare. We will announce the date and time of the Information Session very soon.<br>
The Testing Event will be split into a morning and an afternoon session. The CARIN IG for Blue Button® track is scheduled from 10 am – 2 pm ET and the CARIN IG for Digital Insurance Card track is scheduled from 2 pm – 6 pm ET. The Blue Button® track will focus on real-world testing of the IG including Oral and Vision types. We would strongly encourage all implementers who have not previously tested the Oral and Vision claim types to participate. </p>
