<li>Systems MUST Support US Core Patient</li>
<li>Systems MUST Support US Core RelatedPerson</li>

<p>My concern is that in US Core 3.1.1, a server implementation shall support at least one of (US Core Patient, US Core Practitioner, US Core Organzation). And in US Core 4.0.0, a server implementation shall support US Core Practitioner. So if a server implementation support US Core Practitioner only, it passes testings with US Core 3.1.1/4.0.0 but will fail new testing with US Core 4.1.0. Has that been considered?</p>

<p>To further clarify the concern. In current Inferno US Core v3.1.1 testing, a server passes this MustSupport test if the server provides at least one CareTeam resource having participant.member populated with Reference( US Core Patient, or US Core Practitioner, or US Core Organization). So if there is a system using only Reference(US Core Practitioner), the system can easily pass current Inferno testing. But such system will fail on US Core v4.1.0 because it cannot demonstrate its support of populating Reference(US Core Patient) nor Reference(US Core RelatedPerson)</p>

<p>That's interesting.  That means that US Core 4.1.0 really couldn't be used as an SVAP version for USCDIv1.  Or at least not practically.  I'm tryin to think of a good way for US Core to support both USCDIv1 and USCDIv2 at these same time.</p>
<p>Really I think the only way is to blow up MS, and have different tags for USCDIv1 MS and USCDIv2 MS.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191764">@Cooper Thompson</span>  isn't that already a reality with the expansion of Profiles in new US Core versions independent of MS considerations? By my thinking, if you only support USCDI V1 data scope you can't fully support US Core 4.1.0. I was always assuming that SVAP would need to "pair" particular USCDI versions with corresponding US Core versions. Although, the different USCDI version tags thing is an interesting idea.</p>

<p>I personally think we need to explode MS.  Having one tag that means a bunch of different things in different contexts is really painful.</p>

<p>In a few cases we have 'special' logic Must Support -- but I believe <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> and i have been careful/consistent in how we apply...and are very explicit if there is an special logic.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="285836">@Greg Thole</span>  The issue is that I was <em>hoping</em> that US Core would advance and still be usable for USCDIv1.  In part because US Core 3.1.1 has some issues that have been corrected in US Core 4.0.1.  And it is annoying having to ask ONC for a CCG clarification for every thing we find wrong in US Core 3.1.1.  It would be nice to have an SVAP to 4.0.1 (and maybe 4.1.0 in the future) that could be used for USCDIv1.</p>
<p>The alternative is that the g10 CCG would basically need to list all the Jiras that get applied to 3.1.1 to fix USCDIv1 stuff.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191764">@Cooper Thompson</span> that makes sense and I'm all for it (I think all sides can agree on the complexity of the CCG clarifications reliance). On the flipside, if you want to certify your APIs to a new USCDI version I still think there'll need to be a minimum US Core version attached to that as a dependency (e.g., USCDI V2 and US Core 4.1.0). But that's more of a topic for ONC.</p>
