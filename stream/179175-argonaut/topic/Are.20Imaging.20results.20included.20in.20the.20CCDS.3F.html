<p>I was looking closely at the MU3 CFR, and it seems to indicate (by my interpretation) that Imaging results are considered part of the Procedures CCDS category.  However there isn't any language in US Core about imaging results that I could see.  The profiled DiagnosticReport clearly calls out that it is for lab only.  If we were to include Imaging results in the Procedure resource, the actual result would presumably be in Procedure.report, which points to the non-profiled DiagnosticReport.</p>
<p>So I guess I'm looking for two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does US-Core / Argonaut consider Imaging results to be part of the CCDS?</li>
<li>If so, how should they be represented in FHIR?</li>
</ul>

<p>not specifically, we focused on lab.  We opened up DiagnosticReport to allow it but no guidance provided.   This is something we could consider as a new Argonaut 2019 argonaut project.  Steering committee call tomorrow to discuss next years agenda....</p>

<p>I guess regardless of whether there is any Argonaut work, it does seem to me that imaging is clearing with the scope of the CCDS.  Agree?</p>

<p>if you can, please post relevant MU3 CFR piece here (link or text)...I don't remember guidance for imaging in C-CDA, which is also required to support CCDS</p>

<p>Imaging is not in scope os CCDS at all. There is no mention of it.</p>

<p>There are two sources I'm looking at:  <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/commonclinicaldataset_ml_11-4-15.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/commonclinicaldataset_ml_11-4-15.pdf">CCDS definition for Procedure</a>, which may be non-authorative, but does list radiology under the Procedure CCDS category, and the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/10/16/2015-25597/2015-edition-health-information-technology-health-it-certification-criteria-2015-edition-base#p-1872" target="_blank" title="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/10/16/2015-25597/2015-edition-health-information-technology-health-it-certification-criteria-2015-edition-base#p-1872">CFR</a>.  The specific CFR sections are the bit about imaging for VDT, and then the bit that says APIs should do the same that VDT does:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>DIAGNOSTIC IMAGE REPORTS
We proposed to require that a Health IT Module would need to demonstrate
that it can make diagnostic image reports available to the patient in order to be
certified. We explained that a diagnostic image report contains a consulting
 specialist&#39;s interpretation of image data, that it is intended to convey the
 interpretation to the referring (ordering) physician, and that it becomes part
 of the patient&#39;s medical record.
Comments. Commenters were generally supportive of including diagnostic
 image reports and associated context in the “VDT” criterion. Some commenters
requested clarification on where this data would be accessible within the C-CDA.
Response. We have adopted this proposal to include the diagnostic imaging
report (including the consulting specialist&#39;s interpretation) as a requirement
in the “VDT” criterion. Health IT Modules may include this information in the
“Results” section of the CCD. We clarify that unstructured data for the
interpretation text is acceptable.
</pre></div>


<p>Then later:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>We proposed a new 2015 Edition criterion at §?170.315(g)(7) that would require
 health IT to demonstrate it could provide application access to the
Common Clinical Data Set via an application programming interface (API),
and requiring that those same capabilities be met as part of the “VDT” criterion
</pre></div>

<p>That is not the way it should be read. Procedure reports are different from the C-CDA specification. It only talks about the reports... Not the images. Second point is only about similarities between the 2. It should not be considered literally. As another example, Encounter/Discharge diagnosis is required in C-CDA and by CEHRT, but not required for API.</p>

<p>The API doesn't have to expose it, but it is a requirement to be able to support LOINC/SNOMED for GI.</p>

<p>Ah - I guess to be clear, when I'm talking about "Imaging" I'm actually referring to the narrative result for an imaging procedure.  Not the actual diagnostic or reference image exchange.</p>
