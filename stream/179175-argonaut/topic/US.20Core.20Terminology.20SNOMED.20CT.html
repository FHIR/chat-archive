<p>Hi,<br>
In SNOMED CT, they have active and inactive version of codes/display value as history. Does FHIR recomends to keep the inactive version of codes and display them. For example, for observation, if there is a SNOMED CT at the time the observation was taken but now as per latest SNOEMD CT version, the code is inactive. Then do we need to display the old inactive SNOMED CT in response? or in our codesets we should maintain only active SNOMED CT codes?</p>
