<blockquote>
<p>Should we explore providing patient details to the hold call so that the server can use that info to further validate prior to registration?</p>
<p>background </p>
<p>Assumptions:<br>
- Server not going to hold patient demographic information from appt $find operation until the booking<br>
- Client needs to resend this information to register patient prior to booking the appointment<br>
- Server needs to return a Patient ID to client for booking</p>
<p>The patient registration is a separate interaction sandwiched between a hold and book.<br>
Other workflow has the patient registration at the beginning instead of prior to booking...</p>
<p>There's still a possible bad state if the final booking fails post-registration, then you have a newly created patient with no context to provide the server around why this was created.</p>
<p>Issuing a hold first prevents most of these, but there are still possible cases where a server might reject the final booking once it has the patient context. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Discussed on today's call:  Keep as separate interactions.  The registration and scheduling systems may be separate and is simpler ( at least from a server perspective ) to not comingle this information.</p>
