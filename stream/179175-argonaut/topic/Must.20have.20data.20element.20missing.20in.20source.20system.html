<p>Hi, if any of mandatory where card is 1* or must have data element is missing as defined by IG, then what shall we display in response in facade FHIR. There may be data issue in source system where in response some data may not be available for mandatory or must have elements. Since we are having a FHIR facade layer without a fhir repository and the responses are real time from source system directly to the requester so in that case, can we errored out the entire response because for one data element the data is not available/bad or we need to restrict that particular data element is some way and show the rest of the response. Plz suggest.</p>

<p>Different IGs may set tighter expectations.  Da Vinci sets tighter expectations on profiles it defines, but follows US Core rules where we use US Core.  (The challenge with the US Core rules is that it allows implementers to omit <em>anything</em> - which means sharing data that can't be safely interpreted/used at all.  With most Da Vinci profiles, if a minOccurs = 1, data absent reason can only be used if it's explicitly contemplated (i.e. those places where we think it's reasonable to omit the element)</p>

<p>Things like an Observation where the code is a DAR isn't terribly useful.  You may well have data in your system that looks like that, but exposing it via your interface doesn't accomplish much.</p>

<p>The required RESTful search parameters cull out the most problematic elements for DAR (you always are querying by subject, and for observations you are <em>almost</em> always querying by code).  Though those may be a problem when transmitted over something like the bulk data interface.</p>

<p>The key question is why would we <em>allow</em> a resource to come back without the essential elements that allow you to use it?  There's no requirement to share garbage data.  If we can come up with scenarios where omitting the element would still allow utility, it shouldn't be 1..x.  If there are no such cases, we shouldn't allow DAR.  DAR is really only useful for those situations where "if you're not going to give me the data, I have a business need to know why".  I.e. It's not about a get-out-of-jail-free card for the sender, it's to provide relevant &amp; needed information to the recipient.  If something is important and should almost always be there, but there are legitimate reasons why it might occasionally be absent and if it's absent, the record is still at least somewhat useful, the element should be 0..x, mustSupport=true.</p>

<p>"elements that allow you to use it" are context-specific.  So it needs to be set by IGs.  But setting min=1, but then saying "but anyone's free to ignore that if they've got bad data" doesn't seem like it's going to produce interoperable solutions to me.</p>

<p>I'm not suggesting in any way that vendors aren't doing their best.  If the data is missing key elements, I'm not sure how exposing information that clients can't use provides opportunities to make it better.  I just think it creates complexity for clients - by meaning that they can't count on anything and have to treat bad data as 'valid'.</p>

Hopefully over time the consumer (client) will start reporting back poor data and it can improve over time. Thanks <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="191912">Michele Mottini</span>  for your real-world response, sadly, I am not surprised.</p>

<p>The realworld will always be messy beyond what any profile has said. The profile should not throw up their hands and stoop to the depth of these bad systems / data. The profile should set a realistic bar of appropriate data quality.    Apps better be written to be more robust than the profile defines, the world of bad data is well beyond what you could possibly explain. DAR will be ignored by most apps, they will see the data element they want is missing and discard that resource and move to the next. DAR is not helpful to most applications, only a few will handle it, and they  have few use-cases.</p>

<p>in the last two weeks my developers have encountered three different  instances of garbage data from a FHIR api. the app that wrote it simply had a very different view of the world, they were not following us-core, they were ignorant of it.. to a human looking at the json, it was clear what they were recording, but not any pattern published in a profile. ..  but the point is that it came to our app, and we learned of yet another way that data can look.</p>

<p>The core question for me is whether an instance (and the system that produces it) can reasonably be conformant with the objectives of the US-Core IG if it shares an allergy that doesn't identify the subject or the allergen, or metadata about a document that doesn't actually point to the document in question.  If those instances aren't conformant with the intention and there's no value in the system sharing them, then don't define the profiles in a way that allows that to conformantly occur.</p>

<p>I'm very skeptical of the viewpoint that data must have certain content to be shared.  The real world is just far too messy for that to be successful.  If an IG were to prohibit the use of DAR, that just means that IG is prohibiting the sharing of real-world data.  I always bring up legacy data and patient-entered data.  Consider a patient-entered allergy that was provided during a time window when there was a bug in the form validation for the allergen.  The system has that data.  Preventing it from being shared is not appropriate for a data-sharing IG in my opinion.  I feel like the manta "Garbage in, miracle out" best describes how you have to approach healthcare data.</p>

<p>If the downstream is a patient app, they could review it and submit a correction (of course correction submission isn't quite there yet).  Or submit a deletion request.
