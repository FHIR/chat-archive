<p>here is a summary of the 4 place we used Extensible+Max bindings in Argo-R4/US Core and the applicable regulations:<br>
When these were introduced it was felt in each of these cases it was felt there was need to constrain the vocab due to regulations but still allow for legacy data as strings.  The case of CareTeam the rational is not known.   If there made extensible then they are not strictly in line with the regulations, but cause pain for implementers dealing with real world data.  If they are made extensible then there is no way to validate regulatory compliance.</p>

<p>If you're going to allow text at all, it's not clear you're in regulatory compliance.  If the decision is that practical reality trumps regulation (which I can get on board with), then you're in a non-testable situation no matter what.  Local code vs. text vs. both makes no difference.</p>
