<p>Da Vinci has based a number of their profiles on U.S. Core because, in many cases, there's a need to convey data either from the 'clinical' world to payers or from payers back to the clinical world.  That mostly works well, but there are a few cases where the US Core vocabulary bindings cause challenges - specifically in the area of diagnosis, where for billing purposes what's generally desired is ICD-10, while US Core says SNOMED.</p>
<p>Both choices make sense for their respective spaces.  ICD-10 is a classification system - which is what you want for billing.  SNOMED provides nuanced codes appropriate for clinical rigor.  The challenge is how to make data flow 'safely' when payment data is shared to help inform clinical decisions and/or clinical data is shared to help inform financial decisions.</p>
<p>There are two options that we've come up with in Da Vinci:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create parallel profiles (where necessary) that are 'aligned' with the US Core profiles and then do our best to maintain that alignment as US Core is updated.  The Da Vinci parallel profiles would have looser vocabulary binding.  The downside of this approach is that maintaining alignment will be an ongoing challenge.  Da Vinci implementers who just have an ICD10 code would have no obligation to send SNOMED.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create derived profiles (where necessary) that introduce an extension that allows us to flag a coding as "translated" to make clear if a code has been included by translation and might not have terribly robust semantics.  This would allow systems to send both codes, but flag whichever one was not the original as 'suspect'.  This <em>would</em> however require payers to do an ICD-10 to SNOMED translation, which they're not currently set up to do.  Presumably we'd want to make available a public map if we can find one</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Before making a decision on approach, we wanted to consult with the Argonaut/US-Core implementers to see if they had any strong opinions or had additional options we should be considering.</p>

<p>Isn't this what 'userSelected' is for (with the opposite meaning: tag the original terms, the other would be 'translations') ?</p>

<p>userSelected is what the user originally saw/selected.  If data was post-coded, it wouldn't be marked as userSelected.  But otherwise, yes, this would be similar</p>

<p>Thanks for highlighting Brett, I agree.  Different use cases in mind and different points of origin for data demands. I'd note that from a ONC certification perspective, in certain certification criteria, we have had a separate data element referenced "encounter diagnosis" to deal with ICD-10 and SNOMED CT uses.  Our Transitions of Care certification criterion as an example (which permits developers to use one or the other to represent encounter diagnosis).  But that being said, "encounter diagnosis" was not part of the CCDS (now evolving to the USCDI) so I guess that's why it wasn't immediately addressed by the teams that have focused on the CCDS.</p>

<p>Reading this, I had a 'gut' reaction to option 1 (which I try to explore below :-).  That said, I've not been following this topic, so its fully possible I've missed something obvious.  I'm also not invested in the outcome, but I needed a mental break from my other tasks and this looked interesting.  Properly disclaimed?  Good!</p>
<p>If a facility (where the diagnosis occurs) is adhering to US Core, the diagnosis would be coded in SNOMED.  If a payer (or anyone else) wants a different coding, then they would need to support translating it from SNOMED to their preferred system (e.g., ICD-10).  This makes sense because they would be translating the required coding into <em>their</em> preferred coding.</p>
<p>If that same diagnosis is then sent to a care provider, they would see the original SNOMED coding and choose what to do with the ICD-10 or other codings (e.g., ignore, display, etc.).  I don't have a link, but recall a recent discussion about how to handle multiple code systems for this (e.g., a facility may generate both SNOMED and ICD-10 at origin and what to do when processing it - the thread was about equivalency of multiple values, IIRC).</p>
<p>In the case of adding a new coding, I would posit that payers should be required to preserve the original if the data has the potential to be used in clinical decisions.</p>
<p>I agree that flagging values as translations/derived/etc. would be a good idea (e.g., if a coding is a derived/translated value, it should be flagged as such, preferably with info about which value it was derived from - since there can be multiple 'userSelected' values in the list).  It looks like there is a mechanism for some of this, but it may need to be expanded (e.g., adding a field: <code>derivedFrom:Coding</code> to Coding, adding a <code>derivedBy:Reference(Organization)</code>? etc.).</p>
<p>With all of that said, I feel like creating a second profile that providers need to support to interact with payers would mean the translation is done at the provider.  It's the same work, but being done by people who aren't interested in the output of the translation.</p>
<p>After chewing on this a while, I feel like that's where my reaction comes from.  If providers aren't interested in the translation, how can they be responsible for it?  As an example, how would the eventual transition to ICD-11 be handled?  Providers would at some point need to 'flip-the-switch' on implementation, but payers wouldn't have the data until they do, etc., etc..</p>

<p>If the payers are given SNOMED, it's probably a reasonable imposition for them to return it.  Where things get messy is where they only receive the ICD-10 code (likely in a claim or a prior authorization, and quite likely not over FHIR or even HL7 standards).  From the claims data, they 'assemble' a local view of the patient's problem lists, recent procedures, encounters, etc.   And Da Vinci standards allow them to share that information with downstream payers, with other practitioners or potentially with the patient.  If they sent that data in compliance with a profile that did not require the use of SNOMED, life would be easier for payers, but presumably harder for the clinical systems or patient apps trying to do anything with the data.  On the other hand, if the payers send both the IDC-10 (or 11 or whatever) code along with a SNOMED translation, then life for the provider EHR and clinical apps is easier.  However, the payers are then taking on the legal risk of doing the translation.</p>

<p>From the last US Realm call, I was asked to identify other places where there might be a disconnect between the US Core terminology requirements (often driven by regulatory requirements) and what payers typically accept/have available.  I haven't had a chance to do a full review, but the Da VInci team did come up with at least a couple of extra ones.  In addition to Condition (where payers often only have ICD10):</p>
<ul>
<li>For drug codes, US Core restricts to RxNorm.  Payers also allow NDC codes</li>
<li>For procedure codes, payers allow HCPCS codes - which are a super-set of the CPT codes.  (CPT alone isn't enough)</li>
</ul>

<p>there is nothing stopping US Core users from providing additional codings for NDC codes.  I am not sure what you are asking here by declaring a 'disconnect'.  As you state, the regs call out a code system.  Are you suggesting that we lose the binding and sacrifice code interoperability or add the burden of mapping them to the data source or push the mapping to the data receiver?</p>

<p>HCPCS is a broad set of codes of which CPT codes are a subset.  HCPCS also include codes for other types of procedures that also get billed for.  (And the payers were quite surprised they weren't allowed as they felt the other set was pretty essential.)  I personally wouldn't know a an HCPCS or CPT code if they bit me on the nose :)</p>

<p>The payers are (rightly) concerned about forcing mappings when the mappings may imply a degree of accuracy that isn't there. And I don't think that just loosening the set of allowed codes is going to get us where we need to be.  Consider a few things:<br>
- even if the payers magically shifted to using SNOMED for billing rather than ICD10 (not that that's really on the table).  Also imagine that payers are sharing data with clinical systems that include a mix of clinical data passed to them from other provider systems as well as billing data they've received from other provider systems.  (That's very much on the table and is a key part of what Da Vinci is working to enable.)  As a consuming clinical system, you'd really want to be able to differentiate the clinical information sourced from a clinical system from the clinical information inferred from billing information.  Because the reality is that any codes used for billing are at best constrained by, and at worst warped or manipulated due to the fact that they're used for billing.  You absolutely want to treat such codes with a grain of salt.  What that means is that just providing a SNOMED translation without doing anything else is <em>dangerous</em>. <br>
- transformations aren't necessarily easy between code systems.  There is often a loss of granularity.  More importantly, if you have systems performing translations that don't depend on those translations, you run into two problems: a) there's no feedback loop, so the quality of the translations is often poor, and typically gets worse over time; b) the system performing the translation tends to be concerned about the liability created by performing a translation where the translation isn't accurate<br>
- on the other hand, if we were to take Grahame's solution of "just loosen the rules in the base profile and tighten up the data for meaningful-use covered exchanges", that really just shifts the problem around.  The payers would certainly be off the hook.  They could pass ICD10 or NDC or HCPCS codes to the EHRs freely.  However, the challenge then becomes what the EHR should do with that data when the time comes to expose it to downstream clinical and patient systems that <em>are</em> covered by the meaningful use rules.  I see several options:</p>
<ol>
<li>don't share the data (bad for interoperability and maybe for patient safety)</li>
<li>force the EHR to add translations (which then creates the same issues mentioned above</li>
<li>meet the technical letter of the regulation by sending a SNOMED code, but pick one that's utterly useless (and is thus unlikely to cause clinical error).  E.g <code>55607006 | Problem (finding)</code>.  (Not likely to make our regulators super happy and sort of defeating the purpose of creating interoperability; plus it sets the precedent to then send your local code and "Problem" to meet the regulatory requirement and then all standardization goes out the window.)</li>
<li>carve out a set of exceptions with different rules (e.g. ICD10 is fine for diagnoses but not 'problems'; NDC is fine for dispenses but not medication summary; no clue what to do about HCPCS??), though that means that a provider who knows about a 'problem' and just has an ICD10 code can't put it in the problem list; same issues for medication summary.  So still sort of sucks.</li>
<li>Someone somewhere creates a mapping, including ensuring we add all relevant concepts into SNOMED/RxNorm/whatever to allow precise mappings (and also introduce into the standard a way to flag data that was created for billing purposes).  In some senses, this would be ideal, but it's a <em>huge</em> amount of work - and ongoing work too.</li>
<li>Get the regulations changed to support the sharing of billing codes in meaningful use</li>
<li>others?</li>
</ol>

<p>My sense today, based on your/other comments, is folks want the ability to send what they support today and mapping or changing codesystems isn't on the table. I would love <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191503">@Robert McClure</span> to chime in on which codesystems would support straight forward inclusion of translations (NDC --&gt; RxNorm) and which ones clearly don't (ICD --&gt; SNOMED).<br>
Professionally, I completely understand how we have evolved to the multiple code systems for specific purposes, and we want the data to flow. Putting my patient hat on, I find it maddening that we have clinical code systems and billing which don't seem to play nice together...</p>

<p>Agree with you, Brett.  What we want (and need) is for the provider coding to be done for clinical based on clinically oriented code systems (e.g. SNOMED CT, LOINC and RxNorm) and then the billing/reimbursement classification coding (e.g. ICD-10-CM, ICD-10-PCS, CPT and HCPCS) should be derived from that (ideally automatically).  But we seem to be nowhere close to that world yet.  And in the meantime we have to deal with these separate coding systems and purposes which generally should stay separate.  Coding done using classifications for billing/reimbursement purposes generally should stay in that space, because it tends not be be very accurate or safe for use in providing clinical care, and without it being initially recorded for clinical use there is no consistent and reliable way to transform or translate it to make it fit for that use afterward.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> it's not already a problem because payers haven't had the ability to share their data with clinical systems previously.  (So we're moving from a place where the data couldn't be shared at all to a place where the data can now be shared, but not in the form regulation expects it to be subsequently shareable)</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191405">@Rob Hausam</span> "Codes should stay in that space" - are you suggesting that in situations where a payer is aware of clinically significant information it shouldn't share that information with a practitioner who might not have any awareness of it?  Obviously data that comes from a non-clinical source needs to be considered distinctly from 'regular' clinical data - but it's still much better than nothing.  I agree that one of the things we absolutely need to do is come up with a standardized way of differentiating "billing-originated" data from "clinically-orginiated" data.  But I don't know that we can keep them stored completely separately.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191410">@Brett Marquard</span> I think mapping is on the table if a standard mapping is available that doesn't introduce accuracy/liability issues.  I'm hoping that RxNorm/NDC is one of those.  However, if reliable mapping isn't possible, I think the only solution implementers would be comfortable is a non-useful mapping (e.g. 'Problem') unless we had a solution where concerns about fidelity and liability could be addressed.</p>

<p>Well, I think that asking about the profile of data coming out the system isn't really the important question then. It's about what data will be acceptable to the system - how it will be handled. If it's going to be accepted as is, then the outgoing profile will change.</p>

<p>Extensible works best when the base value set has a set of codes that are pretty much at the same level - and has no codes that say something like "other" or "not elsewhere specified".  Because then things are nice and clear - if your concept fits one of those in the list (or is a proper specialization of one of them), you have to use the code from the list and otherwise you send your own code.  However, when you say your value set is "all SNOMED procedure codes", then your value set includes the code "55607006 | Problem (finding)", and the domain space is 'problems', then it's impossible to have a code from <em>any</em> code system that isn't a specialization of a code in your value set.  Even if you defined your SNOMED value set to be "all specializations of 55607006, excluding code 55607006", SNOMED still has codes for "foot problem", "ear problem", "problem - manageable", etc. that are going to subsume pretty much every ICD10 code that exists.</p>
<p>And this isn't an issue with the fact that you bound to SNOMED.  The same problem would have existed if you'd bound to ICD10 extensible, and then were trying to send a SNOMED code.  Because ICD10 has "not otherwise specified" codes all over the place, it'd be exceedingly hard to find a concept that could be expressed with a SNOMED code that wouldn't fall under one of the ICD10 codes.</p>
<p>We could back off on the strictness of the meaning of 'extensible', but the end result of that would almost certainly end up that from a formal conformance perspective, 'extensible' and 'preferred' would become indistinguishable.</p>

<p>So - given that we've missed the boat on the current US-Core STU update, what would be the appetite to a second STU update that (once we've agreed on any necessary constraints/language to ensure regulatory obligations aren't violated), allowed HCPCS and ICD10 to be communicated in those cases where it makes sense to do so and formalizes the ability to differentiate the source of the data.  (Clearly we'd want to call out 'payer'-sourced data, but we might also want to disambiguate 'patient'-sourced data too.)  Adding support for additional code systems wouldn't break anyone who'd already implemented the first STU update.  Imposing the second would be work, but it would technically only be work for those systems that were accepting data from payer, which isn't generally rolled out yet, so presumably would be implemented as part of that larger chunk of work.</p>

<p>I feel as though this discussion has the cart before the horse. I'd like to hear from the system designers about how they think these workflows are going to work. Taking badly coded data from the payers into the clinical data base sounds like both a scary and a big project to me. Like massive. And then out the other end would come some consensus about the implications. I'd hardly be surprised if the answer was: we'll only take data on the way in if we can upcode it so it doesn't change our internal workflows</p>

<p>I think Lloyd framed the issue pretty much correctly in his original post.  The reality is that most of the data that's flowing around in the US (and probably similar in many other places) is ICD-10-CM, ICD-10-PCS, CPT and HCPCS.  That <strong>could</strong> (but almost never would) be "upcoded" to SNOMED, but probably not with any reasonable degree of clinical utility and safety.  The rule-based SNOMED CT to ICD-10-CM maps that NLM developed were designed in that direction, because that is what would make sense - <strong>if</strong> you already had or could get the data first coded in SNOMED CT.  Mapping in the other direction could be done, but, as I said, probably wouldn't be that useful.  So it seems to me that there needs to be a way to accommodate the  ICD-10-CM, ICD-10-PCS, CPT and HCPCS data in US Core <strong>without</strong> requiring SNOMED.  The alternative would be to keep that data stream separate from US Core, but as Lloyd just posted, it seems that the sense is for the EHRs (and therefore presumably US Core) to be able to consume and handle that data.</p>

<p>The alternative that is also available in the security tags is to use the PurposeOfUse vocabulary. For those things created within treatment, they would have the treatment purposeOfUse. For those things generated purely for payer, they would have the payer purposeOfUse. For those that were just modified from treatment into payer, they might have both. This would be an expected use of this vocabulary when applied to data, as an indicator of what purpose caused this data to exist.   Typically an EHR system doesn't tag everything, as it knows anything within the EHR is implicitly treatment. However out in the Interop space carrying this detail can be useful, as this stream shows. <a href="http://build.fhir.org/v3/PurposeOfUse/vs.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/v3/PurposeOfUse/vs.html">http://build.fhir.org/v3/PurposeOfUse/vs.html</a></p>

<p>I'll add a comment that on the EHR side, we often have more CPT codes on our clinical data than SNOMED.  This is due to the fact that in order to bill, we need CPTs mapped, and folks have been billing for clinical services for a while now :).  Use of SNOMED mappings are increasing, but for most of our content, we will more often have CPT than SNOMED.   And we don't do upcoding/downcoding.  There be dragons.  It's all double mapping.  Typically SNOMED mapping is prioritized.  I.e. the most common procedures are mapped to SNOMED, or the content that needs to be for quality reporting, etc.  Uncommon procedures often just aren't SNOMED mapped (yet), but they normally will be CPT mapped.</p>

<p>Nobody is really disputing the need and we are all in violent agreement and we talking about fricken window dressings.  We <em>already</em> support CPT and I am contending much to @Lloyd's dismay that we bind to both CPT and SCT in Procedure which already blows the pants off of the pure as driven snow  FHIR definition of extensible ... So there is no harm no foul in implementers extending to the HSPSC level II codes too without nary a change to the IG.    Yes we all screwed the pooch on the on ignoring ICD-10 codes in Condition, but it is what it is and again much to @Lloyd's dismay let the implmenters bind to both SCT and extend to ICD-10  and hang an extension on it-  no harm no foul no change to IG and no 2nd STU comment period.</p>
<p>USCDI is about problems and health concerns and the code systems mandated for that is SCT -  I expect that would be the context for app certification.</p>

<p>And the USCDI "mandate", just like CCDS, is very silent on exactly what needs to be mapped to SCT.  E.g. historical data, 3rd party provided data, patient entered data, or low usage content, etc.  When you think about data in that context it really is preferred rather than extensible as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192166">@Jean Duteau</span> mentions.  I don't think USCDI is suggesting that folks go back and manually map 10 year old data that is exposed via the FHIR API, so really the meaning is that SCT is recommended (/required?) for future data.   But since the US Core profile also covers historical stuff preferred seems better.</p>

<p>If you want to cover off all procedures from a clinical perspective, SNOMED alone will do it.  There's no need for CPT codes at all from a 'scope' or a 'precision' perspective.  CPT codes were included in US Core for Procedure because there are lots of times that's all the EHR systems have.  However, the same issue also holds (at a minimum) for HCPCS level II codes.  As soon as you care about procedures performed by someone other than physicians, the common way those procedures are captured and shared is HCPCS level II.  Is it possible they could be mapped to SNOMED?  Maybe.  However, the question would then be - why do physiotherapist and dental systems need to map and physician systems don't?  And how do we address the fact that payers will be sharing HCPCS and CPT codes and never SNOMED codes, forcing the EHRs to translate the HCPCS codes when they don't have to translate the CPT codes?</p>

<p>This is interesting.  I hadn't really thought too much about when conformance claims are made.  But for us, mapping and FHIR support are really separate things.  We could develop FHIR support that <em>could</em> be compliant, and if some health care systems map according to FHIR rules, then their instances would be conformant, but another health system that mapped differently may be non-conformant when running the very same code.  So it isn't really an EHR that is conformant to a profile it is the instance of an EHR at a specific health system, at a specific point in time.  Not sure how the Inferno folks are going to deal with that...</p>

<p>From US physician perspective, EHR interactions (including FHIR) really need to have capability of handling ICD-10 (required for prior auth, scheduling, billing, etc) for diagnosis and procedure codes, ICD-9 for chart data before Oct 2015, HCC coding for risk stratification  and cost of care,  HCPCS for CMS items, SNOMED is being used in addition to ICD-10 for problem lists and medical/surgical history  lists.   SNOMED is not used as much for visit types etc since CPT codes required for billing.    Clinician time is spent matching spinning cherries on the wheel to the detriment of patient interaction.    All of this information needs to be able to flow to meet clinical day to day care.  FHIR will need to  be able to accommodate.   Didn't say it was easy - but easier to add more computing power than increase the physician brain case.</p>

<p>You will have to walk me through this one.   binding is extensible and HCPCS II code Y is used. you assume there is no other concept that represents Y  (in reality are you going to sit down and compare code Y to all of SNOMED and CPT to check that?) so you send Y.  how is that noncomformant - what am I missing?</p>
<p>- Preferred is more like a suggestion but really the same as example - ie use what ever you want.<br>
- Extensible is use these codes first and fill in the (real or perceived gaps) with whatever you got.  From a testing perspective at least with Extensible you can supply data and test for conformance when the proper code system is used. ( is weak but with preferred can't even say that)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> Extensible binding means "you MUST send one of these codes if one of them applies".  The procedure value set for US-core includes the code "71388002 (Procedure)" as well tons of high-level codes for procedures on different body types and with different categories.  <em>No</em> HCPCS II codes exist that could not be categorized as a "71388002 (Procedure)" and I expect all of them could be coded as quite a few other lower-level codes too.  I.e. There will <em>always</em> be a SNOMED code that could be used for a given HCPCS II code.  That means that it's not permitted to have an HCPCS II code by itself because HCPCS II codes cannot ever be 'extensions'.  They're always codes that can be represented (at some level of granularity) by one of the codes allowed in the value set.</p>

<p>Essentially because the scope of the element is "types of procedure" and there's a SNOMED code that covers "all possible types of procedure", marking the element as 'extensible' doesn't accomplish anything.

<p>I'm not advocating for 'preferred'.  However, if we're going to force a binding, then we're essentially saying "translations must occur".

<p>Agree.  That's only an acceptable solution in my books if we decide that letter of the law is more important than spirit of the law and we can't come up with a better compromise.  A single high-level translation is an easy-out that wipes out any prospect of standardization anywhere.</p>

<p>If the spec were going for 'ballot' today we would likely add HCPCS on Procedure and ICD on Condition.

<p>Implementations can 'interpret' things as they see fit, but that doesn't change what the spec formally says, nor does it change the fact that those who interpret in certain ways will end up with instances that are non-conformant.  If we agree that the target is to allow those code systems, then making a conscious decision to be non-conformant now because you're aligning with the "to-be" standard and meeting valid use-cases is a completely viable strategy as long as you're not concerned about regulators coming down on your head.  (It would be nice to get some clarity from the regulators on that bit :))</p>

<p>two related ideas to take up elsewhere:<br>
- probably what we're really trying to say with the extensible binding is something about must-support for a terminology subset. <br>
- we should probably only look to use extensible where there's some kind of classification going on (e.g. all the .category elements)</p>

From the claims data, they 'assemble' a local view of the patient's problem lists, recent procedures, encounters, etc ...On the other hand, if the payers send both the IDC-10 ...  along with a SNOMED translation, then life for the provider EHR and clinical apps is easier.

<p>Billing data is different than clinical data. Deriving clinical data from billing data has risks (there be dragons). Is a claim the same as a diagnosis? No, it's not. Payers should represent billing data as  ... billing data. I question the assumption that representing billing data as clinical data is easier for providers (example: this thread), and regardless of ease, is it right?</p>

<p>This sounds like a false dichotomy to me. I completely agree that billing data (and billing codes) are not clinical codes. But I don't think it's true, from the discussion that we've had, that payers don't have clinical codes at all - I think they have them as supporting evidence, no? Though I think that's not the point anyway, since it's all Condition resource</p>
<p>But perhaps you're suggesting that we would have 2 different profiles on Condition, with different category values, and with different constraints on the code?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191864">@Isaac Vetter</span> The usecase is that payers may know something about the patient that a given clinical system does not - a medication, a past procedure, a health condition, etc.  The desire is that this information propagates to the clinical system so that it can be viewed by clinicians and considered by CDS systems as part of   delivering patient care.  The question is what the workflow should be to make that happen?  </p>
<p>Will clinicians look for past procedures, meds and conditions in persisted claims data?  Will EHRs provide an integrated view?  Will CDS systems look at claims data too?</p>

<p>It seems that the assumption is that "claims data" is a thing that is persisted in a silo. If that's the case, then having the same data available in a different "clinical" representation from the payer system is probably useful, but not all systems treat payer data in silos. </p>
<p>I think  that this  different clinical representation shouldn't be the only, or even the primary interface to get the data. Just like for codes "forcing mappings when the mappings may imply a degree of accuracy that isn't there", for resources, forcing the data in a different structure  when the structure may imply clinical judgement that isn't there can be problematic.</p>
<p>Ideally, if there is clinical data not known by the clinical system, the best way to obtain the data would be to query the other clinical system that owns it. Is there currently a way to relay the source of data from the payer to the clinical system?</p>

<p>Data gets passed to the payer via different means.  Most commonly as part of claims or prior authorizations.  That might be data that's coded specifically for the claim (e.g. ICD-10 codes, CPT billing codes) or as clinical attachments (which might be coded a variety of ways or not coded at all.  In principle, there could be Provenance instances associated with all of that data.  The Da Vinci interactions typically call for the payer to 'push' the data to the clinical system - as the clinical system wouldn't likely have a reason to query that particular payer for that particular data.  That means that the EHR would need to store - and make available to the clinician and/or SMART apps/CDS Hooks services/other CDS solutions - the data received.  Even if the data came as pure clinical US-core conformant data, the fact that it was originally submitted in support of a claim/prior authorization would presumably 'color' the data's interpretation, so I think there's likely a need for a flag even if no conversion takes place.  Obviously, if conversion is necessary for the clinical system and/or other systems to access the appropriate data, then a flag is even more necessary (regardless of which end the conversion happens at)</p>

<p>Right, so is the following taken into consideration:</p>
<p>Payer gets data for claims or prior authorization -&gt; payer pushes claim/PA data to clinical system, including source of data -&gt; clinical system decides if that is enough, or it queries the clinical source of data, or it asks for available clinical representation of data from payer?</p>
<p>Sounds like we are jumping to the last part (clinical representation of payer data) right away, and I am wondering if that is indeed the starting point.  At the point where clinical data representation of payer data is necessary, then having a way to "flag" it is necessary, I agree.</p>

<p>The presumption was that payer data needed to be represented as clinical data in order for SMART apps, CDS Hooks and even the EMRs themselves to make use of it.  I think that assumption is born out by current system behavior, but it's certainly an assumption we could revisit.</p>

<p>The goal of the Basic Provenance project is to address these kinds of intermediaries. If the data ends up at a clinical setting having come from a payer setting without original author Provenance; then it should be seen as 'payer' quality. Payer quality might be seen as useful, but it should be seen for what it is, payer quality and not clinical quality.  If the Divinci team want to be taken seriously then they need to take on Basic Provenance. If they did that, then the bread-crumbs back to the author would be available.</p>

<p>I agree that there are differences in clinical and financial data, but we aggregate the data today for a variety of use cases (e.g. pop health use cases as well as keeping the local EHR updated/current).  While terminologies are often different (e.g. RxNorm vs NDC, SNOMED vs ICD), there are other variances which cause us more grief when transforming that financial data from a claim into a US Core FHIR resource.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clinical concepts extracted from a claim (e.g. immunizations, procedures, medications, conditions) don't have a status, yet FHIR (and often the EHR) requires a status.</li>
<li>Claim diagnoses, specifically, tend to be the most unreliable (for clinical purposes) since they are "point in time" and never get updated to denote "this diagnosis has since been refuted or ruled out".   </li>
<li>Claim procedures have modifiers whereas clinical EHRs may not.  <a href="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/CPT.20Code.20Modifiers" title="#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/CPT.20Code.20Modifiers">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/CPT.20Code.20Modifiers</a> started the discussion about how to convey modifiers using FHIR (e.g. single Procedure.code expression vs modifiers represented independently from code).  The challenge is that some modifiers impact status (e.g. 52, 53, 73, 74) and others have a clinical significance that can impact CDS (e.g. whether a patient had a bilateral mastectomy versus unilateral mastectomy).  Simply stated, modifiers can't be ignored.</li>
</ul>
<p>In sum, I support the need to aggregate clinical (EHR) and financial (claims) data together even though the variances I mentioned do introduce some challenges.</p>

<p>I would call it "in progress".  Step one (which Argonaut has done) was loosening the US Core profiles to allow conveying things like ICD-10 so we weren't in a position where payers had to translate to SNOMED.  However, there's still questions about if/how such data should be integrated.</p>

<p>So josh to rephrase are you saying that Da Vinci approach of using clinical resources to transact billing data is suspect?   Should we have have put up a stronger defense to adding billing codes to us core clinical profiles. And should we adopt a more robust strategy in the future?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> I don't think Josh is arguing against being able to include billing codes in clinical resources.  I expect that the system Michelle is describing would still create those.  Also, there will be data that comes <em>in</em> to payers (in the form of claims or prior authorization attachments) that will also contain such billing codes.  I think the discussion right now is about "where should the derivation occur and should the source for the derivation be available to whoever receives the derivation.</p>

<p>In the case of a claim, it's quite likely that the Claim itself is not shareable except in a highly redacted (and potentially even non-conformant) manner.  You can't know who submitted the claim or for how much or how much was paid.  All you can know is that the claim included certain procedure, medication and/or diagnosis codes.  Is it more useful to send that non-conformant claim instance than it is to send Condition, Procedure and MedicationStatements with a flag that says they're claim-derived?</p>

<p>The derivation process can happen at multiple stages.  An EHR might derive some information then send it to a payer who might integrate it with other data and derive more information who might send that to another EHR.  I'm not sure how practical it will be to send the long-tail of the source material all the time.</p>

<p>That is where I am confused ( and I imagine are others)  what I am hearing is:</p>
<ol>
<li>There should be a bright line between billing and clinical on the data source/sender side.... whether through provenance or separate resources or profiles.</li>
<li>let the receiver sort it out.</li>
<li>the question of codes has not been directly addressed but from the initial discussion waaaayyy up at the top of this thread everybody who chimed in was all for mixing in billing with clinical codes.  I regret not getting more input or asking the right questions before adding it in (which we editors will own up to) at the 11th hour.  (Hence trying to get some take aways for next time.)</li>

<li>Should data that payers derive from a claim be sent as a claim, as Condition/Procedure/etc. or both?</li>

<p>Too often people think of "Security" as only access controls and encryption. Security is the mechanism to protect against "risks" to "Confidentiality", "Integrity", and "Availability". The vocabulary from which PAYAST comes from is addressing "Integrity", in that it is a vocabulary that holds a set of statements of the trustability and authority of the data. So it does fit the proper definition of "Security".</p>

<p>Grahame it might not accurate to state that payers don't manage clinical problem list.  Depending on the employer contract, payers sometimes have on-site case or care managers on site at facilities, and use their own population health system to create, track and shar clinical problem lists...as part of the services to members/staff of the employer, per the terms and care plan requirements the payer product.   AND those payer clinical problem would be shared with the medical staff of the facility.  Unknown to me?  The role and challenge of ICD-10 versus SNOMED in the payer's population health tools, and the level of data exchange with the clinician EHR, if at all.</p>
