<blockquote>
<p>In order to enable consistent access to scanned narrative-only clinical reports the Argonaut Clinical Note Server SHALL expose these reports through both DiagnosticReport and DocumentReference by representing the same attachment url</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this means that pathology reports need to be exposed in <code>DocumentReference</code> as well as <code>DiagnosticReport</code>. Do we have recommendations for which <code>type</code> and <code>class</code> would be used in this case? (I'm just starting to map the Argonaut IG to ONC's proposed expansion of the USCDI and make sure I understand how this plays out.)</p>

<p>class = clinical note</p>
<p>type = LP7839-6 Pathology</p>
<p>Is what we are proposing...since that is being used for the DiagnosticReport Category as well.</p>

<p>There are a few dates in DocumentReferene, they all have different meanings as described in their definitions. The important perspective to understand is that the bits-that-are-the-document are different than the DocumentReference which is the metadata about the document. The document might appear in many places. Attachment.creation is the date the bits-that-are-the-document were created. The DocumentReference.date is the date the DocumentReference was created. This recognizes that the document has a different lifecycle than the DocumentReference. Sometimes they are equal, most of the time they are different.</p>

<p>If the definitions can be improved, then a gForge tracker should be created... If argonaut simply didn't understand (even due to poor core definitions) then fixing that can be handled within Argonaut (much similar to fixing MHD is done using IHE governance). Most of the time an opportunity for improvement is an opportunity in many places. Improvement is good.</p>

<p>I understand the SHALL constraints we have today. I think they just don't provide guidance for somebody who  is trying to follow our recommendation that pathology notes appear in both places. I think our guidance needs to explain exactly what to do, i.e. if you have a diagnostic report that looks like this, here is how you create the equivalent document reference, and here's the slot that you fill in with the same code that you used in the diagnostic report.</p>
