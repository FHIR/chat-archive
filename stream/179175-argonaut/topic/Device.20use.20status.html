<p>As I understand from 2015 Cert, in addition to device identifier, we also have to be able to track the status of a device with regard to whether it is in use or has been removed (or deactivated in some way).  The Argonaut project used Deevice, I'm wondering how folks are tracking use of it.  Device.status is not a great fit, although I suppose "available for use" could mean in use for a patient, and unavailable might mean something like removed or deactivated. What have others done?</p>
