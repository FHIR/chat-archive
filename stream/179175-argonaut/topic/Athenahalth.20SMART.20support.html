<p>Apple Health appears to be able to connect to Athenahealth systems using SMART (or at least OAuth2). </p>
<p>I registered as a developer on the Athenahealth site but I cannot find any documentation about that - the only stuff I found actually says that AthenaHhealth does NOT support OAuth</p>
<p>Is anybody able to shed some light? Maybe someone from Athenahealth in this group could clarify things?</p>

<p>I e-mailed the athenahealth team to point them to your Google Groups post. They've indicated they plan to respond.</p>
