<p>For <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/2022Jan/">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/2022Jan/</a> --  the links in the ballot notes box point to the continuous integration server instead of to the ballot content directly. I think this is an editorial error; not a big deal, but something worth avoiding in the future, because it can be confusing for folks who are reading the ballot if they are taken elsewhere in the process (this came to my attention because somebody reached out to ask me why these links were pointing to content outside in another version of the soec).</p>

<p>yes thanks for pointing this out,  we  provided these links so the reviewer can see the changes during the ballot. We  recognized they pointed to the identical CI build after the fact however, during the ballot the content between the the ballot and CI build was identical.  However , for some unlikely event the reader the is using these link after  the ballot cycle, the content will diverge as we apply changes to the CI Builld.   We will not republish the ballot version ro correct this.  The correct links will be applied to the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/history.html">hstory file</a> when the final version is published sometime this summer.  In the meantime , if  you really want to link to the balllot version then change the base of the link from  <code>http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core/</code> to <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/2022Jan/</code></p>
