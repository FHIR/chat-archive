<p>On our last CGP we discussed this tracker: <a href="http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-34553">FHIR-34553</a>  and as promised I mocked up Condition as separate profiles for problems, encounters and sdoh <a href="https://hackmd.io/h8qcpCyYTwKTuxIp-tbTjQ?view">here</a>.   This is a departure from how we have profiled Condition in the past and is more like the vital signs profile were we have one profile with the common elements and multiple derived profiles that nail down the terminology and the "conditional must support" elements.   The reason we are looking at this is because some elements are optional or must support depending on other elements. Besides documentation there is no other way to represent "conditional must support" in a machine readable way (invariants won't work here) and for US Core the matters for the certification.</p>
