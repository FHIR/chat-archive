<p>Hey - Brad from Imaging Integration WG here - I had an interesting question while attending HIMSS yesterday. To what extent has Argonaut been looking at exposing medical imaging via ImagingStudy and the associated DICOM / DICOMweb mechanisms? It's a simple-sounding question with likely a mountain of architectural discussion - but I'm curious to what extent this has been explored. <br>

<p>Both Argonaut Data query and US Core specifically address laboratory results.  Although the subject has been broached on several occasions we haven't come to a consensus on what to support for imaging.  The argonaut project has not identified it has a priority, but It certainly is something that could looked at in the context of US Core.</p>

<p>My understanding is that it hasn't made the cut as a priority for Argonaut focus on. Original focus was MU. If there is a use case that could change the prioritization, I'd be interested in hearing it. On the other hand, I'd be interested to understand why the questioner was looking to Argonaut, and what they felt needed to be constrained/extended.</p>

<p>Thanks  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191401">@Eric Haas</span> - any ideas on how I could get involved / informed somehow when imaging topics comes up in the argonaut project?</p>
