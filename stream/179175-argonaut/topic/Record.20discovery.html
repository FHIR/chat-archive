<p>Maybe a silly question... I am new to the Argonaut architecture.</p>
<p>How does one know where to go to get a patient's records, in the case of an app which is not launched from within an EHR (i.e. with context)?</p>
<p>Would you need to prompt the user to nominate the endpoints which their information lies within? Or is there some sort of central directory that points the way towards records for a patient identifier?</p>

<p>the application must know the server to which it wants to connect, and the application must be registered with it.</p>

<p>if argonaut defines a way to register applications on the fly - there are such specifications, and we've talked about it - then you'd either need to let the user enter a url on the fly, or there would have to be a central directory. Obviously the second would be much more convenient for a typical user, but it requires someone to curate it</p>

<p>Are there currently any apps which currently exist outside of "EHR context"? That aggregate data across endpoints?</p>

<p>There are two different things being discussed here. First is the fact that an application will not be given any access to data within a custodian without that app being approved to a level of trust at that custodian. This is the app registration factor Grahame brings up. It is a problem of trust, not a problem of discovery. Custodian organizations need to be able to have some reason to release any information, however small, to that app.  In the absence of trust, I hope and expect every custodian will DENY access regardless of how persuasive the plea is.</p>

<p>An app trustability would be a different vector from the specific patient data or the specific user rights.</p>

<p>There are two different models for discovery today: First is the Patient initiated, like Apple Healthkit. Precondition is that the app is a trusted app.  The Patient has a relationship with various healthcare organizations. Thus in this case the user is the Patient, and they have access to their own data alone. The Patient introduces that healthcare organization to their app, this enables the app to grab data that the patient has authorized, and that the custodian will release.</p>

<p>The second is where the User is not the patient, but has some level of authorization. Typically a clinician, but could be a guardian, researcher, etc. In these cases broader queries can be done, again restricted to the rights of that user and authorizations given to the app.   Remote clinician use-cases, similar to how nationwide or regional health exchanges (e.g. XDS/XCA) operate, could be enabled such that the user/app starts with a Patient query to find matching patient identities to the patient identity they know. Once a match is determined, then queries into that patient data would continue as expected...</p>

<p>well, regulation in USA is that the institution trusts the patient, and has to trust their selection of an app - which is where auto-registration comes into play. There's no reason to think that apps will be able to register themselves for non-patient access</p>

<p>I agree that would be useful flow... My point is that the trust of the app is a different factor from the authorization the user has. Both must align, but they are different vectors.</p>

<p>..and record discovery is a big issue: we present a list of providers we know about and can connect to and the patient chose one (or more), but there is no way to discover all the available providers end point beside the ones from Epic - that are published at <a href="https://open.epic.com/MyApps/Endpoints" target="_blank" title="https://open.epic.com/MyApps/Endpoints">https://open.epic.com/MyApps/Endpoints</a></p>

<p>The lack of a intergalactic provider directory is an operational issue, right? That is to say that the model for provider directory can support it. The problem that needs to be solved is motivation to build and run such a directory, motivation to participate in such a directory, and policy around who can be published and who can query. The motivation can be compelled by regulation. The policy is very important, else this become a fantastic tool for malicious intent.</p>

<p>A related item is endpoint security and assurances--e.g. being sure I am at the right FHIR endpoint for healthcare organization ABC, entering credentials at the right OAuth server. Is anyone working on a way to address this? Aware of the good work around provenance and that addresses this question in part.</p>
