<p><strong>Objective</strong><br>
Document guidance in IG on how to retrieve active medications.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong><br>
In US-Meds IG (STU3), the active medication list was retrieved by querying MedicationStatement exclusively where status = active.</p>
<p>In STU3, MedicationStatement had two elements for taken (Boolean) and status.<br>
•   Taken was used to represent the medication usage (in the past)<br>
•   Status was used to infer whether the medication should be on the “active meds list” (i.e. whether the patient <em>should</em> be taking the medication going forward) </p>
<p>In R4, MedicationStatement added not-taken into the status value set (and removed the taken Boolean).  </p>
<p>In R4, MedicationRequest was enhanced to add a new reported[x] element that indicates whether the MedicationRequest was reported (insert definition).</p>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong><br>
Using MedicationStatement exclusively in R4 doesn’t work since we lost the ability to use MedicationStatement.status to convey whether a not-taken medication is on the active med list (i.e. should be taken).  Some not-taken medications are associated with active orders/prescriptions while other not-taken statements are associated with old orders/prescriptions that have since been completed or stopped.  </p>
<p>Using MedicationRequest exclusively in R4 raises some questions about whether it is scoped to handle patient statements about their over-the-counter (OTC) medication usage since there often isn’t an underlying prescription or request.</p>
<p>Using both MedicationStatement and MedicationRequest introduces patient safety risk if an application made a false assumption that all active medications were returned from a single resource.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the boundaries between MedicationStatement and a <em>reported</em> MedicationRequest present a challenge for systems that don’t make that fine distinction.  For example, the following use cases are often handled in the <em>same</em> way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patient conveys to provider A that another provider B prescribed a given medication </li>
<li>Patient conveys they took an OTC medication </li>
<li>The system programmatically learns of an existing medication and makes a non-authoritative copy </li>
</ul>
<p>By contrast, systems <em>can</em> differentiate between:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the patient said about their medication usage (taken vs not taken)</li>
<li>Whether the provider wants to keep the recorded MedicationRequest or MedicationStatement on the active medication list</li>
</ul>
<p>In sum, we have a bit of a catch 22 where:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can’t use MedicationStatement exclusively (when status = not-taken), nor can we use MedicationStatement to convey status of what was ordered (when usage differs order/request status)</li>
<li>We can’t use MedicationRequest exclusively (when scoped to exclude patient statements about OTC medications)</li>
<li>Systems often don’t differentiate between <em>reported</em> MedicationRequests vs MedicationStatements, so the boundaries are challenging to honor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong><br>
Argonaut / US-Core IGs propose using MedicationRequest exclusively to get all active meds</p>
<p>Any concerns with the Argonaut proposal to use MedicationRequest exclusively (which includes OTC medications)?  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191321">@David Hay</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191759">@Melva Peters</span></p>

<p>Just to check whether I understand the background: we're saying that a record of the fact that a medication wasn't taken (say, like one skipped dose?) is (sometimes) a fact that belongs on a patient's "active medication list"?</p>

<p>Yes I have concerns.  A MedicationRequst is not an appropriate resource for non- ordered meds.  To get a complete meds list, you need to look at both MedicationRequest and MedicationStatement.  To be safe, taking a look at MedicationDispense too.  If that's a safety issue, it needs to be resolved through education - or better yet, moving to use List.  Cramming stuff into a single resource is not an appropriate solution.</p>

<p>Okay, so the fact is that this med belongs on their active medication list.  There may also (distinct from this) be a recording of the fact that the patient isn't taking the medication. And presumably there's some clinical process to detect and respond to the gap (talk to the patient; remove the med if they don't want it, etc).</p>

<p>Yes,  "not taken" medications can appear on the active medication list for many reasons.  As David said, PRN is one specific reason, but it really applies to any and all active orders.  The underlying active order means that the provider is still telling the patient to take the medication (regardless of the patient being non-compliant with those instructions).  We keep those active orders on the active meds list (regardless of compliance) due to clinical decision support (e.g. interaction checking) since the patient could start conforming with the provider's instructions.  When medication reconciliation is done, the patient is asked about ALL "home medications" -- that includes OTC (self-prescribed), prescriptions that this provider wrote, as well as any other medications prescribed from other (external) providers.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Not sure what the definition of "non-ordered meds" is, but I will just add that MedicationRequest does support MedicationRequest.requester = Patient and MedicationRequest.reportedReference =Patient.  Why isn't OTC considered in scope as a self-prescribed / patient-initiated medication?</p>

<p>MedicationRequest is about an authorization to dispense/administer.  MedicationStatement is a summary view of "what is that patient taking" (or occasionally, "not taking").  In an OTC, there is no authorization (or alternatively there's an implicit authorization for "everything", which would be equally meaningless).  What you're tracking there is "what is the patient taking" - which is the purpose of MedicationStatement.  You can use MedicationStatement exclusively to represent "what is the patient taking" - whether prescribed or not.  But as soon as you want to get into authorizations or the notion of compliance, you'll need to add MedicationRequest into the mix.</p>

<p>Doesn't this boil down to whether systems actually implement these boundaries?  At least in our system, the following "reported" medications are undifferentiated:</p>
<ul>
<li>OTC "reported" by the patient (no order)</li>
<li>OTC "reported" by the patient that was prescribed by another (external) provider, perhaps for insurance or reimbursement purposes</li>
<li>Any external order "reported" by the patient - prescribed by another (external) provider</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two bullets above are included in the scope of MedicationRequest, so we're only debating the first bullet above.  However, we can't honor those boundaries if the system doesn't make that differentiation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This resource covers all type of orders for medications for a patient. This includes inpatient medication orders as well as community orders (whether filled by the prescriber or by a pharmacy). It also includes <strong>orders for over-the-counter medications (e.g. Aspirin)</strong>, total parenteral nutrition and diet/ vitamin supplements. It may be used to support the order of medication-related devices. It is not intended for use in prescribing particular diets, or for ordering non-medication-related items (eyeglasses, supplies, etc.). In addition, the <strong>MedicationRequest may be used to report orders/request from external systems that have been reported for informational purposes and are not authoritative and are not expected to be acted upon (e.g. dispensed or administered).</strong></p>

<p>I understand the use case of PRN meds, and of documenting non-compliance. I'm just struggling to understand what might be an implicit approach to modeling these things -- normally, I'd think a PRN med would be documented on the active list, with a dosage indicating Dosage.asNeeded; and a medication that the patient misses sometimes/often/always would be documented on their active list, with additional resources to capture information about the fact that they sometimes/often/always/just-on-tuesdays skip a dose.</p>

<p>If you don't differentiate these different OTC records and don't have anything that would differentiate and say "hey, I'm actually an order" (such as a prescriber, prescription number, dispense authorization information, dispense records, etc.) that you want to expose, then all of that information can show up in MedicationStatement.  But the full-blown non-OTC orders you have would still need to show up as MedicationRequest rather than MedicaitonStatement because you're going to need to expose things like prescribers, authorized quantity, etc.  I.e. you're going to have two separate resources.</p>

<p>On the last Argonaut call, a couple vendors said that implementing MedStatement is a lower priority if we can use MedRequest exclusively to get active meds.  We need MedRequest to convey "active medication orders" that have a MedStatement.status = not-taken.  To Josh's point, most use cases just want the active meds list and don't care about the MedStatement.status (of not-taken), which is why some of the Argonaut vendors are prioritizing MedRequest above MedStatement.</p>

<p>You can get active meds with just MedicationStatement - but you can't get any prescription details.  You <em>can't</em> get all active meds with MedicationRequest because not all meds will be prescriptions.</p>

<p>That doesn't sound like the only way to model (partial) non-adherence. There are a lot of nuanced things we might want to say about adherence, none of which detract from the fact that a medication belongs on someone's active list with the status of active.</p>

<p>MedicationRequest does not have a way to say "not taken". (Nor should it.) So the Argonaut proposal leaves no way to record "not taken".<br>
If Argonaut has no requirement to record "not take", just exclude "not taken" from the Argonaut-permitted values for MedicationStatement.status and keep using MedicationStatement.</p>

<p>If you as an app sees MedStatement with "notTaken" - how do you know if they are going to continue taking it? It's active? It's suspended?</p>

<p>If you see a MedStatement with "not taken", then it's a med that they're not taking at all (and have no known intention of ever starting).  It would generally be record of a med that decision support or good practice would suggest they <em>should</em> be taking but, for whatever reason, they're not.  MedicationStatement doesn't imply anything at all about what's prescribed/authorized.   The problem is that there are two distinct concepts in EMRs - proper prescriptions and "other meds" and argonaut is trying to cram them into a single resource.  That's not going to work well because they have very different purposes.</p>

<p>It's totally fine to capture meds a doctor outside the system has prescribed as MedicationStatement - so long as you're willing to toss information related to the authorization.  In fact, if you're willing to toss information about authorization, you can even expose information about your own prescriptions via MedicationStatement.  However, you can't talk about compliance if you're not dealing with MedicationRequest because there's no expectation/authorization to be compliant 'to'.  One MedicationStatement could cover a period of 10+ years over which there could have been 20 prescriptions.  Or none.</p>

<p>The problem that we hit with MedicationStatement was that there was a desire to capture order/authorization type information in it.  Once you're in that space you need to supplement (not replace) with MedicationRequest.</p>

<p>It's concerning to me that even among the very-well-informed crowd here, there's really not a consistent understanding of the semantics of these resources, statuses, elements, etc. We have quite a lot of resources in this space, which means a lot of expressive capability (likely too much for us to arrive at a common understanding).</p>

<p>Things I'd like to see addressed, if it's not too late:</p>
<p>1) Can we establish that "sometimes I don't take X" is a statement that's important, but the statement itself is not part of a patient's "active medication list" (though X may be a part of the patient's active list).</p>
<p>2) Can we clarify that "one API call" vs "2+ API calls" is not a requirement for safe application behavior? (Or if a single API call is seen as a requirement, let's just define a custom operation with all the semantics we can agree to baked in -- like, <code>/Patient/:id/$argonaut-active-med-details</code>: "return a Bundle with all statements and requests that are considered relevant for understanding the patient's active meds")</p>

<p>Ok.  But if you're capturing compliance information, that implies that you know: a) that it was ordered; b) enough information about the expected dosing to be able to assess compliance.  Is that information captured in discrete form (so that you could differentiate and say 'this is definitely an order') as opposed to a record that someone takes garlic twice a day for which no conformance statement is appropriate/relevant (because no one told them to take it at all, let alone how much)?</p>

<p>Right.  So the issue is that you want to say "They're not taking this external medication, but I still want it in the active list" - but you don't want a List resource that lets you maintain which non-taken stuff should appear in the active list and which shouldn't.</p>

<p>It's intended to represent "this is an actual order created somewhere and I've received enough information about the 'order' aspect (e.g. how much was authorized, where it's to be dispensed, etc.) that I actually want to track that capturing it just as a statement isn't sufficient.

<p>Your system might have received that information by querying or receiving a push from another system or through a patient's PHR.  In some cases, the patient might have brought in a copy of the prescription or their pill bottles which provide enough information (e.g. dispenses remaining).</p>

<p>From an "in the active list or not", what should show up in the active list is going to be business-rule driven.  Some not-taken meds (whether local or external) meds should be in the active list for some period of time - possibly a long period of time.  Others, not.  Neither MedicationRequest nor MedicationStatement have any flags about whether they should appear in the (an?) Active Medication List because the expectation was that if you're getting to the point of actively managing what should appear on the list vs. not, that the List resource would be used.</p>

<p>For external meds (including OTC), we are capturing a request status of sorts (<em>separate</em> from the compliance status of taken or not) -- We determine the active meds list based on request status -- not compliance status.  That is what pushed us to use MedicationRequest following the breakfast in Cologne with Melva, Lloyd, and I, which is when we learned we shouldn't be using an event status (i.e. MedicationStatement.status) to convey the request status.  Request status is what drives it being on the active meds list.  Would it be possible to meetup at FHIR DevDays to discuss in person?  It might be more efficient than Zulip.</p>

<p>Well I won't be at FHIR Dev Days, and not sure about other Pharmacy Co-Chairs, so keep us informed.  I have read the entire Active Medications chat.  To me there are several questions we need clear answers for:  How to differentiate/represent Medication orders that are authorized ( use Medication Request); How to capture Medication orders that come from outside of my control ( I didn't authorize them, but I know about them) (I thought this was Medication Statement but after the above discussion I don't know); How to represent patient or other persons statements about my taking or not taking a medication ( I believe this is a Medication Statement); How to query for the Active Medications for a patient, where Active Medications has meaning that can be described by the Argonaut folks? ( I thought this was a combined query for both Med Requests and Med Statements); How to query for Active Medications for a patient, where the Active Medication has meaning different than what Argonaut uses e.g. what are the active meds for the patient as reported by the patient ( I believe this is a list of Medication Statements); you will notice I have not used the word "compliance" I think this is the area where we have the most difficulty and warrant further discussion.  I need a clear definition of compliance.</p>
