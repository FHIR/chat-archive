<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191315">@Josh Mandel</span> Thank you for your thoughtful analysis of the situation with respect to survey instruments. As I see the issue, USCDI version 2 specified SDOH Assessment with examples of types of assessments. Unfortunately, it is difficult to reference an evaluation tool and create a generic US Core Screening Response Observation Profile without expanding the scope and stakeholder community since there is a large clinical and quality improvement community that use screening response observation instruments to manage clinical care, to provide clinical decision support, and to measure outcomes with respect to quality. Some of those screening instruments are risk-assessment and clinical status tools as well. Such screening tools are widely used in clinical care clinicians use EHR products to collect the responses; it is the ability to tie together the components and sharing through a FHIR API that seem to be the challenge.      I've tried to consider different approaches: (1) Terminology-based - allow each tool and each of its components to remain observations (I.e., not Observation.component) and use the LOINC AccessoryFiles/PaneslAndForms.csv to find the parent for each component code.  This approach requires terminology services that may not be readily available in all cases. (2) Retain the "must support" proposed for Observation.component in the new profile - this requires significant work on the part of vendors for a generic use case that cannot cover all possible variations in evaluation instruments, some of which have nested components and, thus, seems unreasonable. (3) Suggest use of Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse to contain any evaluation instrument of interest (the Questionnaire) and the results (QuestionnaireResponse). This approach seems analogous to a document-based answer that may create additional overhead in trying to evaluate change over time (and which specific change in components) such that the QuestionnaireResponse would need to be unpacked anyway except for just human viewing. (4) Create a Must Support for Observation.derivedFrom such that each component observation maintains metadata about the parent instrument code from which it is derived (note the US Core proposed profile already includes MustSupport for derivedFrom with reference to the same profile. An alternative is the suggestion Josh Mandel provides using hasMember for the instrument parent code to list its members (note that hasMember is not currently listed as Must Support).    From this review, it seems that Josh's suggestion to have 2 profiles: "SDOH Item" and "SDOH Panel" with the Must Support items he listed makes the most sense - I leave it to the community and more technical folks to determine if hasMember or if derivedFrom is the better approach but either seems more palatable and useful than the current Observation.component Must Support.  I also might consider that SDOH in the name of both the "Item" and the "Panel" show consistency with the USCDI v2 requirement, a less restrictive name for the profiles is worthy of consideration.</p>

<p>That's my read as well. I would not expect <code>derivedFrom</code> to represent the relationship of an observation to it's parent panel, that would be <code>hasMember</code> (from the panel to the constituent observations). We use <code>derivedFrom</code> to indicate the Observation was extracted from a QuestionnaireResponse.</p>

<p>These are orthogonal concepts. From a US Core perspective, I think the most important thing is to have a consistent structure for representing granular and nested observations (i.e., <code>hasMember</code> semantics). We don't have any expectations that such Observations will have originated from Questionnaires (i.e., <code>derivedFrom</code> semantics), though of course that's one path.</p>

<p>if you are looking for a direct link to the assessment tool from where the questions came from for an observation you need to use either Provenance or the relatedArtifact extension.   To fetch based on a particular questionnaire or form you would use a chained search a la:</p>

<p>FWIW, there is this <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html#gr-other">further clarification in observation</a>. The application of these elements to survey instruments described above seems reasonable. In general I think use of .hasMember should be somewhat constrained. It should be used when the primary observation is, in part at least,  defined by these references, each of which is distinct and used as is. </p>
<p>.derivedFrom really is anything else, but more specifically the primary observation is doing some transformation of the referenced observation to yield a "derived" result.</p>

<p>In the LOINC community we had a lot of discussion about the various "collections" of things across domains (lab, clinical, forms, structured reports, etc) that have child members and found far more similarities than differences and thus elected to use a common structure ("panels") to represent them. Many SDOH surveys are remixes of other instruments whose items can stand on their own as interesting/important.</p>
<p>Seems that <code>.hasMember</code> to indicate child observations is a good way to go, though many SDOH (and other) surveys are nested (e..g subpanels for each domain). The description of <code>.hasMember</code> mentions DiagnosticReport  for nested grouping.</p>
<p>If/when there is a <code>QuestionnaireResponse</code> you'd use <code>.derivedFrom</code> to link.</p>
<p>Occasionally, but not always, the instrument will have one or more summary/total score variables, so conceivably those could point to the individual observations that contributed to the summary AND the QuestionnaireResponse if there was one?</p>

I.e., the multiple responses to one question would be handled as multiple observations based on the same code? I think that was part of the original ask.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191864">@Isaac Vetter</span> I think we need to explore your comment more deeply.  Yes, the ability to calculate risk assessments is critical when the evaluation tool has such calculate as part of the tool and calculation is generally performed in a SMART APP or in an EHR to provide an answer. However, the individual responses do have value for trending in addition to the overall score (if indeed a score is involved). There is value in transmitted grouping by survey and all data related to any survey could not necessarily be transmitted as a whole unless I am missing something. There are surveys that have unique entries that have meaning only as part of specific tools and the USCDI request is not specific to any given survey.</p>

<p>Isaac, no - there are surveys that have value as a whole, but individual results can be trended for specific improvement for individual care over time. These may not be SDOH-specific but they are evaluation instruments for clinical care and measure developers have sought to look for specific improvements in elements. That includes the asthma scales.  I will request some examples from the quality measure community.  However, as for a query on observation with a bunch of LOINC codes - I don't know that they would transmit all data related to the survey unless they were linked somehow with .hasMember. Or one would have to use the LOINC tables to reconnect them (at least that what I have been given to understand).  Note that CDS may also need to refer to components of a survey to suggest specific interventions.</p>

<p>The issue with "multi-select" is that if you refactor the questionnaire to be "better"(?) and have individual 1-5 questions about "how hard is been to get x" and "how hard has it been to get y", then you need to maintain multi-select support even if you collect that same data in a more discrete way.</p>

<p>Sorry - entered too soon: Josh's Suggestions as I understand it: Question for modeling:<br>
(1) Set of answers collected as part of the same instrument (these six questions are part of one survey) and any single question may have 1 or more answers AND (2) Individual assessment observation which may have 1 or more answers. I'm finding it confusing when we include the single question with one or more answers as part of the "single observation" and as part of the "panel" - different evaluation tools have different approaches and we need to support a generic approach to handle them.</p>

<p>And please note, the USCDI v2 element is SDOH Assessment. However, US Core balloted a more generic approach "US Core Observation Screening Response (<a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core/StructureDefinition-us-core-observation-screening-response.html">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core/StructureDefinition-us-core-observation-screening-response.html</a>). Thus the proposed profile in US Core would encompass any other structured evaluation/risk assessment tool including those generated as PROMIS measures included in LOINC - and many such components have value only as part of the tool in which they exist.</p>

<p>Thanks Josh, for the updated approaches and trade-offs.  I tend to lean toward option A and for this reason:  I have heard the concern about multiple choice responses and I need more context from experts in the field of SDOH.  I specifically looked at PRAPARE ( <a href="https://forms.loinc.org/93025-5">https://forms.loinc.org/93025-5</a>) and I basically see one survey tool code (93025-5) which has 5 sections: Personal Characteristics (94043-8), Family&amp;Home (93042-0), Money&amp;Resources (93041-2), Social&amp;EmotionalHealth (93040-4), and OptionalAdditionalQuestions (93039-6) - each of these "sections" has a number of question components but each of those questions has a single response chosen from a list of normative response options.  So, I see this as an observation.hasMember with each section as an observation.hasMember and the subsequent questions as single observations each with one result.  I don't know that I would consider that a multiple response but a nested set of observations.  IF that is the case, Option A should work well. And the US Core guidance could provide the PRAPARE tool as an example.  I look forward to comments from others.</p>

(See <a href="#narrow/stream/233957-Gravity-sdoh-cc/topic/LOINC.20PRAPARE.20questionnaire">my report here</a>.) Once that's fixed, the form demo at <a href="https://forms.loinc.org/93025-5">https://forms.loinc.org/93025-5</a> will show these as "Check all that apply"</p>

<p>I look these options as to whether we inject US Core at the beginning (pre data extraction) or the end (post data extraction)  ( or both ends) of the data collection chain.  So depending how data is collected and stored will skew your opinion.  Also I noted there is a fair mix of FHIRR5 search concepts in the mix so don't get thrown off by that.</p>

<p>each of those questions has a single response chosen from a list of normative response options.<br>
   I see that the issue is a bug in the LOINC display now - there are some that should be "choose one" and some questions that allow multiple responses.  I'm wondering if the observation.value can have a cardinality of 0.. * to accommodate the multi select without interfering with the other modeling. (Sorry if this sounds like a naive response, I'm trying to help get to some solution)</p>

<p>The QuestionnaireResponse for data entry doesn't preclude the Observations for final output target too.<br>
(using the observation based data extraction is actually pretty simple to setup)<br>
Having this capability could then lower the bar for data capture, could leverage a smart app launch that does the SDOH questionnaires to generate the QR and then extract into the Observations. Happily moving the complexity - and also then use pre-pop to grab any existing data, but still be able to append in any that doesn't already exist.</p>

<p>Agreed; this is akin to (C) in my write-up.</p>

<p>for me, I think profiling both and how they work together would be awesome - then be able to leverage both where requried.<br>
But on the where does this data end up question - I think that really does belong down in Observations... (and supporting QR if that's where it was originally collected from)</p>

<p>The main question we're looking at right now is how to be judicious with requirements US core while still meeting the policy objectives.</p>

<p>Based on the Feb 17th Call proposol to include <strong>both</strong> QuestionnaireResponse and Observations to Record and Store Assessments Responses in FHIR, I am drafting a mock up how this would look <a href="https://hackmd.io/ObMVJ_ohQu2QsFZMiKYSBg?view">here</a>.    This is preliminary as I  have only completed some of the technical aritifacts. I will draft the narrative introduction and Quick starts and overall guidance later today.   Based on this, I will update all the assessment related trackers so we can review and vote on them on the thursday call.</p>
