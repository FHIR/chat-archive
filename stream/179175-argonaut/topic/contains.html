<p>I notice Argonaut profiles do not constrain out "contained." It's a tempting pattern that offers a place to put lots of things that don't have homes without the bother of creating extensions, but that looks like a great way to ensure no one will understand what you're sending. Is anyone using it for anything? Does anyone think it should be?</p>

<p>How would it stop you from needing extensions?  You can't put anything in contained that isn't actually pointed to by the resource (or by something else in contained that's pointed to by the resource).</p>

<p>Constraining out contained would be very inappropriate as there will certainly be situations where systems might need to convey a Medication, Practitioner, Organization or other resource that doesn't have enough information to stand alone as an independent instance.</p>

<p>As far as if anyone is using them: the argonaut profiles specifically call out that Medications <em>can</em> be contained: <a href="http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/StructureDefinition-argo-medicationorder.html" target="_blank" title="http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/StructureDefinition-argo-medicationorder.html">http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/StructureDefinition-argo-medicationorder.html</a></p>
