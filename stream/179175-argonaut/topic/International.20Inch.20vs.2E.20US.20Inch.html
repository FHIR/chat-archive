<p>I don't know about others, but I'm pretty healthcare providers in the US use measurement scales which are based on the US inch, which is just a little bit different from the international inch, which would imply [in_us] rather than [in_i].</p>

<p>After some research, I find that prior guidance to use [in_us] in other guides is incorrect, as that reflects units of measure used in the US prior to 1959 when everything was defined based on the metric system.  So [in_i] is correct.</p>
