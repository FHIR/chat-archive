<p>As I feared,  I made a change in a branch committed and pushed ( forgot to close excel and is all @#$ up but that is separate issue )  checkout back to master branch run the build and voila it is as if I never made a change.    So how to I keep a local build copy of all the cumulative changes?  so I can move forward without having to wait for a PR to be approved and updating the master before I can make the next incremental change?</p>

<p>so if I run the build  ( specifically the <a href="http://publish.sh" target="_blank" title="http://publish.sh">publish.sh</a> bash) in the current branch it reflects the changes.  if I checkout to the master branch and then run the build,  it does not.   Is this expected behavior?</p>

<p>That's expected behavior.  However, you should be able to merge the change from your branch into your local master</p>

<p>How do I do that? ( by how I mean step by step command lines that i can literally copy and paste into my shel l )</p>
<p>What happens when I do a git pull origin master if I merge a branch with the master?  will I get conflicts?</p>

<p><code>master</code> is usually considered a special branch; so usual pattern is to: <br>
1. make your changes on a feature branch (which will be initially a copy of the master branch), <br>
2. add any new files<br>
3. commit the changes, <br>
4. push the commits to the remote (GH in this case), <br>
5. create a PR<br>
6. merge the PR (this is often expected to be done by a third party under the guise of code review)<br>
7. checkout master<br>
8. git pull</p>
<p>If master is updated in the meantime, a <code>git pull</code> will reflect the changes upstream (it by default updates all local branches) ; you can then merge them into your feature branch by running a <code>git merge master</code>- here you might get conflicts if the changes you have made are on the same files as what other people have been updating; this can be painful, but there are some good tools to assist.  W.r.t to running builds, by default the current branch will be the upstream version plus the changes you've made.</p>

<p>To do a local merge:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git merge my-branch
</pre></div>


<p>1. The first checks out the <code>master</code> branch<br>
2. The second runs a git pull to sync with the remote master <br>
3. The third merges the commits from your feature branch into the current branch (<code>master</code>)<br>
If there are conflicts, it will tell you here; I recommend a tool for managing the conflicts; the Jetbrains tools work pretty well.</p>
<p>There is a second command <code>git fetch</code> which just fetches the changes;  ==&gt; <code>git pull</code> does a <em>fetch</em>, followed by a <em>merge</em></p>

I especially like the 'learn git slowly' answers - as if git is actually our job</p>

<p>I'm not hopeful on that front right now - the workflow I am following is really very complicated; the documentation you wrote is right in principle, but doesn't deal with our reality.

<p>well, what might help is :<br>
- agreeing on 1 or a few UI enhanced clients that we document, and documenting for them. For instance, I think that most of us on windows use tortoisegit. command line documentation I'll be ignoring. I simply don't understand how you can meaningfully review changes in 100s of files using a command line tool<br>
- documenting a workflow that supports maintaining a single local folder you work in, and committing sets of changes out of it as separate PRs (while maintaining the integrity of your local workspace)</p>

<p>A slightly crazy idea here - what if each individual had their own branch (and only one).  When you pushed, if the branch built, it would auto-merge.  You could commit and push at will, always working in one branch.  No switching.  No stashing.  But still having the ability to test before merging.  Is that viable/technically possible?  We'd have 40-50 branches, though probably only 10 or so that would be terribly active.  I'm sure this notion will make git afficianados cringe (and I do get why), but what I'm interested in is maximum simplicity, minimum pain and getting the one and only thing we really looking for from Git - not breaking builds.  (And I think that we ought to also be able to get the "changes must be reviewed if they're impacting normative content" capability with this mode too which was the major "nice-to-have" we'd been hoping for.)</p>

<p>If everyone has their own branch, they can only break themselves - and are on the hook for fixing themselves.  Only downside would be someone who pushes something and doesn't notice that the build failed.  They think they're done, but their stuff never got migrated.  So we might need to set up something to ping people occasionally (every day?  every week?) if their committed branch is unmerged.</p>

<p>I think the theory is that CI would help Lloyds case; if he does his work in isolation on a feature branch; pushes the branch to GH, and you have travis-ci running on the PR with merging being blocked until the build passes (on your feature branch), then <code>develop</code> after someone merges the PR will still be stable and working.  Anyone pulling from <code>develop</code> at that time would be guaranteed to have a working branch.  </p>
<p>Features are aimed at change requests, so for example you'd have a branches called: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>feature/forge_101_add_valueset_to_patient</code></li>
<li><code>fix/forge_102_amend_status_description_for_patient</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These branches which would be merged into <code>develop</code> via a PR, that if gated by a status check will prove that the develop branch is always in a working state.  </p>
<p>When someone takes on a new task (Say FORGE-103), they would: <br>
1. <code>git checkout develop</code><br>
2.<code>git pull</code> <br>
3. <code>git branch feature/forge_103_add_coding_decision_workflow</code> (which creates a copy of develop under the new branch)<br>
4. <code>git checkout feature/forge_103_add_coding_decision_workflow</code>    <br>
5. do some work, commit your changes<br>
6. locally run the build on the feature branch; if it passes, move to the next step - if it doesn't then the issue lies with changes on the branch, which need to be fixed before moving on<br>
7. <code>git push origin feature/forge_103_add_coding_decision_workflow</code><br>
8. Create a PR - <em>NOTE</em> GH will warn you if you are out of date so you can mitigate locally before pushing again<br>
9. Wait for the CI status checks to pass (which they should, because you ran them locally) and then someone will merge into <code>develop</code><br>
10. Goto 1.</p>
<p>You can of course replace all of my references to <code>develop</code> by <code>master</code> but the concept remains the same.   Change Requests are tracked by the branch and pull requests.  You could have multiple clones of the repository, and in doing so switch contexts to work on another task while the build is running on the current (ie /dev/fhir1 /dev/fhir2), but that could get confusing fast.  So long as you follow the <code>git pull</code> then <code>git branch</code> you should be able to stay sane as <code>develop</code> in the repository will always be stable; the nightly build would run off the <code>develop</code> branch and per the contract will always be in a working state.</p>
<p>well, that's the theory</p>

<p>I think that theory is exactly what we're doing with git this week (on "master" rather than "develop") and exactly what seems to be causing some angst.</p>

<p>I think that Lloyd's idea might work.  Each person can create and work with and push from their own 'develop' branch (like 'rhausam-develop').  I think that could be managed locally, and wouldn't necessarily need to be prescribed or enforced (particularly if some committers prefer a different workflow).  If the local master branches are kept clean, then they can always be fast-forward updated (without conflicts) by <code>git pull</code> and then those updates can be merged into the 'develop' branch via <code>git checkout 'local-develop-branch'</code> and <code>git merge master</code>.</p>

<p>The standard workflow for Grahame, myself and quite a few others is "I'm fixing a bunch of stuff simultaneously.  Some of it is done and other stuff won't be done for hours or days.  The stuff that's done, I want integrated into the mainline now (because someone's waiting on it).  We don't create different branches for different features because we can only run one build locally and we can't wait for a build to finish before we work on other stuff.</p>

<p>So, I thought that's what I was saying with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This means the changes you just made on your feature branch are no longer in your working directory, they are in a pull request that needs to be reviewed and merged into master. Once the change has been merged to the master branch, use "Pull" to get those changes into your local repository's master branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm concerned that either I'm not understanding what you're saying or I haven't explained that well in the documentation. Thoughts?</p>

<p>Ok, I misread - the commandline tool just does a checkout (without the pull). From the docs I now see that tortoisegit seems to do a fetch and merge from the <code>origin</code> at the same time.  Please ignore my comment.</p>
