<p>Rik has 2 pull requests that haven't had their pre-checks run - and they're quite old.  Can we poke them somehow to make them run?  Also, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191651">@Rik Smithies</span> you've got a really old failed pull request - are you planning to commit a fix to it or will you delete the pull request?  And <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> You've got a 2-day-old successful pull request that isn't yet merged.</p>

<p>I wish that the github bot notified us when a pull request built ok</p>

<p>I've had lots of cases where the pre-checks seem to never run. No idea why. I  have closed all those pull requests now, thanks for the hint <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> .</p>
