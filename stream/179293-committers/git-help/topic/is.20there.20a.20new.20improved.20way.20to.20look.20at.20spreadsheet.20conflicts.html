<p>I thought the reason for having to close the spreadsheet prior to each commit was so the conflicts would be easier to resolve.  as in a conflict in a single line or lines  instead the entire file as I see it now before me in my text editor...</p>

<p>it should indeed work that way. not sure what work flow lead you to that point</p>

<p>Right now I looking for any workflow that works for me...I'm running these huge commits in a the fhir-clone and when and if it is successful I'll stash it to a new branch and then commit.    But after a git pull,  I got a conflict that was the whole spreadsheet.</p>

<p>so if you do a local stash without letting the build update the spreadsheet first, you can get this problem, because the build hasn't canonicalised the spreadsheet first</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> I thought the CI-build was going to check that the spreadsheets had been processed before allowing them to be merged - so if your stash messes things up, that should still get caught before a merge to master?</p>

<p>It does. But your stash has nothing to do with the ci-build. You can stash an uncorrected spreadsheet, and end up in this place</p>
