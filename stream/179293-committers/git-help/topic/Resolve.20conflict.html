<p>I got my first conflict when creating the PR.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/HL7/fhir/pull/159" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/HL7/fhir/pull/159">https://github.com/HL7/fhir/pull/159</a><br>
Suggestions on how to resolve this conflict?  I tried to view the conflict (which seems like an Excel thing) and not sure what to do next to get it resolved in order to approve the PR</p>

<p>Looks like the only conflict is which sheet was active.  Go in and say Resolve conflicts and edit the file such that there's only one active sheet, then click on "mark as resolved"</p>
