<p>Grahame, we have an outstanding open question that didn't get resolved at Connectathon. (BTW GREAT event--just super busy and no chance to just run into you in the hallway to follow up on this question.)</p>
<p>We have a spreadsheet of concept information that is generated within the Gravity Community, and we use it as a base reference for tracking where we stand with content identified as needed, code submissions/discussions with Code System vendors, assigned temporary codes to support testing, etc.  We want to include the spreadsheet in the FHIR IG specification.  </p>
<p>Our first preference is to point to it from Confluence (while we are still in development mode), but before going to ballot we would like to be able to include it wholly in the IG as a persisted downloadable reference document.  We are able to load it into the IG materials (using Trifolia). However, having it loaded in generates an error.</p>
<p>(I know the CARIN IG has a similar need and they are including the document. Amol <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192132">@Amol Vyas</span>   or Igor, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191393">@Igor Sirkovich</span>  can you please confirm the approach you are taking and if you also are getting errors due to including the file? </p>
<p>What do you advise for handling this need?</p>

<p>The IGPublisher has no issues propagating binary content into the spec (whether that's images or spreadsheets or whatever).  My guess is that - if there is an issue - it's with Trifolia.  Can you indicate what error you're seeing?  (If Trifolia is still trying to send binaries "inside" the hyperlink, that's not allowed for large files by the HTTP spec (not to mention that it's just generally a bad idea because you can't then reference the same file from multiple locations).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192205">@Lisa Nelson</span> : The CARIN BB IG is using the data:URI mechanism to reference an immutable document (based on how DaVinci PDex was using it at that time. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="192609">@Mark Scrimshire</span>). If you're seeing errors during coding/compile time, I would check the syntax otherwise a runtime error usually means you've reached an HTTP server or client limitation. Also, I do agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  that this kind of referencing mechanism is not sustainable.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> : What is the best practice approach for IGs to refer to supporting documents in an immutable way? Could an acceptable way be to perhaps refer to a commit-specific permanent link of the document under source control (for example, a GitHub <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/ed25584f5ac2520a6c28547ffd0961c7abd7ea49/README.md">url</a>)?</p>

<p>Moving this discussion to #committers (the notification stream is really for automated messages)</p>
