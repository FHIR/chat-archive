<p>Hi, we have a business usecase where the status values in Immunization resource (R4) do not capture different values we have internally. So, we are planning to create an extension to capture our custom status. Having said that we do not want to use the status field which is required as per the spec. Can any one guide how to deal with this kind of situation? Is it expected to populate some value in status even though it does not carry any significance or is there a way to drop that in the profile? (We are using fsh and we get below error)<br>
Cardinality constraints cannot widen the cardinality.  0..0 is wider than 1..1.</p>

<p>An immunization without a value for status is not a valid instance of Immunization. <br>
You might find that all of your immunization records are for completed immunizations and that is why have no interest in Immunization.status. If so, in your profile fix the value of Immunization.status to 'completed' and do not make it must support. <br>
That will mean that the sender must populate the element that way and the receiver can ignore it.</p>
