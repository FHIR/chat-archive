<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We are looking to define an extension to be used in a Questionnaire.<br>
The value of what we want to document there has a specific structure. We have a JSON Schema for it, but don't know how we can capture this in the profile. </p>
<p>There is no such thing as valueObject to store free form objects (which is probably a good thing) so we were thinking about valueString.<br>
We could just stringify the JSON and put it there, but this feels a bit hacky.</p>
<p>I think this comes down to the need for a custom complex type and then use valueOurCustomType in the extension.<br>
This does feel like diving into a rabbit hole ... so it's worth verifying our approach here before we try this.</p>
<p>Any advise on how to tackle this?</p>
<p>PS: We're pretty new to profiling (tbh this is the first one we are creating), so forgive me if i'm missing the obvious. :-)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Your stringfying approach is simple and would work, I think. Maybe the structure with it explicitly known schema could also be split into an extension that consists of elements of FHIR-specified datatypes.</p>
