<p>Hoping the PA group can help explain the usage of the Servicing Facility in the v2 PV1 segment and how it relates to FHIR. PV1-39 is  defined as "This field is used in a multiple facility environment, e.g., multiple campuses or buildings, to indicate the healthcare facility with which this visit is associated." But it's not clear what this means given the patient location in PV1-3 can contain a facility and/or building. As well, a data type of CWE doesn't make much sense either. We're wondering if this equates to Encounter.serviceProvider (The organization (facility) responsible for this encounter). Any insight would be appreciated</p>
