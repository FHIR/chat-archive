Summary: Language value set needs to be broadened<br>
Ballot Weight: Affirmative<br>
Submitter: Robert McClure<br>
Proposed Ballot Resolution: Not Persuasive<br>
Resolution: After reviewing the comments here and the referenced tracker where the decision to use the given set of values we are happy that the existing definition is adequate.<br>
This definition and binding permits the use of ISO639 3 character languages also which are also valid BCP47 codes.</p>
<p>Notes: This was covered on a conference call back in June, where we considered the comments from others on the issue that had provided feedback, and also checked the other referenced item. However would like to get a vote with a larger attendance to ensure that we're on the mark.<br>
(This issue has also been posted to the PA skype chat, and the PA listserv)</p>
