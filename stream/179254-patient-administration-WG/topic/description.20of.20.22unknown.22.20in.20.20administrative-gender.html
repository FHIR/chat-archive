<p>I was looking in more detail to the administrative-gender code system and there is a piece of the description of the unknown code that is not fully clear to me.<br>
It says "If the only thing that is unknown is how to properly express the value in the necessary constraints (value set, datatype, etc.), then the OTH or UNC flavor should be used. No properties should be included for a datatype with this property unless: Those properties themselves directly translate to a semantic of "unknown". (E.g. a local code sent as a translation that conveys 'unknown') Those properties further qualify the nature of what is unknown. (E.g. specifying a use code of "H" and a URL prefix of "tel:" to convey that it is the home phone number that is unknown.)".</p>
<p>But it is not clear to me how this applies to most of the cases where the binding is required and the datatype is code (maybe only for the FamilyMemberHistory.sex ?)</p>
