<p>How does one perform a search using demographic data ONLY across both Person AND Patient resources simultaneously when one does not necessarily know if a person is or is not a patient? <br>
Is it implicit that if some Persons are NOT patients then ALL Patients must also have associated Person resources so that the search function will run against the Persons rather than Patients?</p>
<p>Scenario: Mother is NOT receiving care in our system but her child is receiving care.<br>
Initially, the mother is represented by a Person resource and the child is a Patient resource.<br>
Mother then presents herself at our urgent care clinic. What search do we perform to make sure we locate the mother's record not knowing if she's an existing Patient or a known Person?</p>

<p>You can't assume that Patients will have an associated person resource, nor the other way around. Your search would require complex server side logic, using _query (a stored/named query) or some other non-search-url based search mechanism.</p>

<p>If the server supports base searching, the <code>_type</code> parameter, and all the demographics you want to search on are supported, it should be possible via something like <code>http://example.org/fhir?_type=Patient,Person&amp;name=someName...</code>.</p>
<p>Your milage will vary on whether a server supports all of those things - make sure to check the returned <code>self</code> link to verify that all of your conditions were met.</p>

<p>With that mother case, you also be interested in the RelatedPerson resource too.<br>
As things have been, not many do Person at all. Doing Patient and RelatedPerson would be more reliable.<br>
And doing a batch search including the 2 (or 3) queries at once can make it a single call (from a rest perspective)</p>
