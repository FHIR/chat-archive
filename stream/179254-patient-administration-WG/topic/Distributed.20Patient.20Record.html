<p>Hello to all. This is my first post on this channel.<br>
My health system (Northwell Health) is in the process of converting our HIE data into FHIR. Our HIE maintains a hub-and-spoke architecture of our hospitals and ambulatory practices. The "hub" is our patient index and the "spokes" are individual hospitals/practices. <br>
Current capabilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>This model allows us to view the FULL aggregated patient record or PARTIAL by selecting specific sources to look at.</li>
<li>Demographics could conflict/change over time and we need to maintain clarity on each source's demographics data for a patient.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we transition to FHIR we want to maintain the above two capabilities. How would we design our FHIR resource architecture for patients?<br>
Options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Person resource as the "golden record" version of the aggregated demographics and link to the resource ALL relevant Patient resources with clinical data hanging off each of those?</li>
<li>
<p>Manage 1 "formal" Patient resource  ALONG WITH <a href="http://Patient.link">Patient.link</a> (replaces) records with individual source demographics. <br>
Clinical data will ALL be under the "formal" patient record with possible tags pointing to the source Patient record for filtering purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something else?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Would love to have an on-camera zoom/Teams meeting to get this group's understanding of the pros, cons, and general challenges.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>This probably a good topic for the #implementers channel given that its scope is much wider than just patient administration, this being an architectural design question. <br>
What you maintain at the hub need not be what you expose to a FHIR client. If there is a strong use case for #2, go for #2. Otherwise, keep things simple by using #1.</p>
