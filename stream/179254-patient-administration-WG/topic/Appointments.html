<p>If we have an Appointment [request] associated with 3 actors, and one of these (or rather: their scheduling application) decides to reject because of a conflict, the overall scheduler would need to set the status of one of the other actors to needs-action, notably for the actor that initiated/proposed the scheduling. However, this is not known to the scheduler. The scheduler will know that Actor '#3' has rejected it. Actors #1 and #2 may already have accepted it. So would the scheduler just set the status of both to 'needs-action' ?<br>
We may need an actor-status parameter, to query for participant-status for some specified actor.</p>

<p>That would depend on your systems requirements. The spec is silent on the behaviour here.<br>
It could be that the appointment would be cancelled, rescheduled, or otherwise and could also incur costs, or not, maybe depending on timing.<br>
Not an easy area.</p>

<p>PA has started a project to define how recurring appointments, requirements are being collated here on Confluence <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PA/Recurring+Appointments">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PA/Recurring+Appointments</a></p>

<p>The iCal spec has some good detail on recurring appointments, will review that on the next call too...<br>

Have started the draft of the changes for recurring appointments</p>

<p>The base draft is looking in reasonable shape on the working page, enough that we're going to put something into the core specification for discussion and review.<br>
Of note is the choice to define the recurrence properties not using the Timing datatype - will want feedback on that.<br>
And propose to do some sample resource drafting of what using the timing datatype would look like in comparison.</p>
