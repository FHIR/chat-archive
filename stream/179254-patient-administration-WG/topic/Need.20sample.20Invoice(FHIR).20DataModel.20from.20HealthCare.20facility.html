<p>I am trying to implement a Datamodel for our company using Invoice FHIR data structure.<br>
<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/invoice.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/invoice.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/invoice.html</a><br>
<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/invoice-example.json.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/invoice-example.json.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/invoice-example.json.html</a></p>
<p>We specifically want to see a Invoice sample/example from a Provider or Nursing Home/Homecare facility who currently uses FHIR Datamodel.<br>
There are couple of queries that I currently have:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is only one tag for date field.<br>
"date" : "&lt;dateTime&gt;", // Invoice date / posting date<br>
  If the services availed by an insured is two weeks, how does a provider/facility send this two weeks date range through this Invoice model?  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the provider/facility calculates average daily amount for the service on day basis and sends 14 Invoices corresponding to each day of the service availed ?</p>
</li>
<li>Is there a provision to include net amt/gross amount on hourly basis alongside with option to have date ranges?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for any information you provide. Please let me know if this post needs to goto another stream.</p>

<p>Invoice.date is the date et which the INvoice has been posted, so it's always a date, never a period.<br>
Services that are billed in the invoice my have been provided over a preiod of time, which is stated in ChargeItem.occurence[x]</p>
<p>What we don't have is an overarching period on the Invoice that covers the overall period in which any of the billed items have been provided.<br>
Is that what you need?</p>
