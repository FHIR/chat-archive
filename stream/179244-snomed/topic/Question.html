<p>This is not an unreasonable place, and I'll have a go at an answer:<br>
Some concepts have descriptions, and the FullySpecifiedName of a concept is supposed to be the authority on meaning (the Fully Specified bit) but in practice that doesn't always work and the underlying meaning can only really be determined by looking at the surrounding concepts in the hierarchy and the associated modeling (other defining relationships).<br>
Additionally, it helps to have a basic understanding of SNOMED (<a href="https://www.snomed.org/snomed-ct/education" target="_blank" title="https://www.snomed.org/snomed-ct/education">https://www.snomed.org/snomed-ct/education</a>), and then the next port of call (which is perhaps the real answer to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> 's question) is to contact your national release centre, if you have one, or SNOMED International if you don't.</p>
