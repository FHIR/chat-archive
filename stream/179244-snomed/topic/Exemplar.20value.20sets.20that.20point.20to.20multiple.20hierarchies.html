<p>During the Snomed on FHIR calls, a concern was raised with Pharmacy about one of our value sets that points to different hierarchies.  No solution was proposed about what the valuet set should look like.  Can anyone provide any guidance or suggest who we should reach out to that was part of this work to get some input.  The value set was <a href="http://build.fhir.org/valueset-reason-medication-not-given-codes.html" target="_blank" title="http://build.fhir.org/valueset-reason-medication-not-given-codes.html">http://build.fhir.org/valueset-reason-medication-not-given-codes.html</a></p>

<p>What was the concern? If this works, why not use it?</p>

<p>I'm not sure.  On a Snomed on FHIR call, the group raised a concern.  Unfortunately I don't think any guidance was given.  None of the Pharmacy co-chairs were on the call.  I'm not sure what the scope of those meetings are.  Pharmacy is trying to determine if anything needs to be done about this</p>

<p>You may be referring to this bit that was <a href="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/FHIR/Medication+Resource" target="_blank" title="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/FHIR/Medication+Resource">documented</a> (apparently from <a href="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=64265275" target="_blank" title="https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=64265275">July 3</a>)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MedicationAdministration<br>
Refusal reason is a wrong binding.   Those codes in SNOMED relate to the actual medication that was refused.   Perhaps better option to use &lt;&lt; 182895007 |Drug declined by patient (situation)|</p>
<p>Note that 242990004 |Drug not available for administration (event)| is another item in that valueset, but it is concerning that we're picking from different sub-hierarchies here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll have another SNOMED on FHIR Terminology Binding call next Tuesday (but, of course, that's after the FHIR freeze of that matters).  We can further discuss it here in the meantime.</p>

<p>Ok, so they are noting that there are concepts from two different semantic types - situation and event. I do not find the distinction concerning. If the concepts work, you have a green light from me.</p>

<p>Thanks Rob.  I'm not sure what the intent of these meetings are, but if you have any input into the conversation and outcome, it would be good if they came up with solutions and not just issues!</p>

<p>I think that "Perhaps better option to use &lt;&lt; 182895007 |Drug declined by patient (situation)|" is an attempt at suggesting a solution?  Further discussion and input is certainly welcomed.  And it's really essential to have sufficient engagement with the relevant parts of the FHIR community (e.g. Pharmacy) in order to provide useful guidance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that doesn't cover all of the reasons why a medication was not administered.  We included the following hierarchies to try to cover them: Include codes from <a href="http://snomed.info/sct" target="_blank" title="http://snomed.info/sct">http://snomed.info/sct</a>  where concept is-a 406149000 (Medication refused)<br>

<p>I've run this past our terminologists and they see no problem with this particular use of codes from multiple hierarchies</p>

<p>I don't really recall much more than a fairly brief mention of this on the July 3 or any of the calls.  I think it was more of a comment from a overview rather than a product of significant discussion and analysis by the group, as I recall.  It certainly can be revisited - and this is an example binding.  I agree that it doesn't seem likely to be a significant issue.</p>
