<p>Hi all, we have been trying to convert all of our ICD10PCS into SNOMED codes but we could not find any mapping resources  between IDC10PCS and SNOMED in the public domain.  Can you please point me to any online resources for this purpose?  Many thanks for your help.</p>
<p>TT</p>

<p>Back in 2016 when at snomed looked at this (think it was the spanish asking but it was a while ago). Don't know how it has progressed but I would get onto Snomed to see how it was going. I think there was stuff in pcs which was missing in snomed  but as stated ask Snomed directly (you can find email addreses on their website which will resolve to people who can help).</p>

<p>There has been some work on mapping the US ICD-10-PCS procedure coding system to SNOMED CT, but I don't know how complete it is (I suspect not very).  Kin Wah Fung at the NLM has been involved in this and the other ICD-10 to SNOMED CT mapping projects and has made several presentations and written papers on this, and I expect he may be in the best position to know the current state of it at the moment.
