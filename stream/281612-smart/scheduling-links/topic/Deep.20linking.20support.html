<p>I think this is targeted toward publishers, but in the various consumer implementations I’m working on with states, we could <em>easily</em> make use of context about target location. (Most providers we’ve seen have a <code>landing page → screener → search for locations → book slot</code> flow, but if a publisher could provide a querystring arg that starts at the screener and skips the location search or that narrows it to a state or zip code or distance-from-point, that would be amazing!)<br>
On the other hand, we aren’t well designed to make good use of time/product/dose level info.</p>

<p>Our deep links can support location, provider and visit type (not set up in my <a href="http://fhir.epic.com">fhir.epic.com</a> sandbox currently, I'm working on getting that set up).  Visit type setup can vary by organization.  I expect most folks will have a special visit type for 1st dose, though they may not have different visit types for Moderna vs. Pfizer.  There is likely to be a different visit type for single dose vaccines, but ultimately it will depend on organizational build, so while I checked the option in the survey indicating we support the vaccine product/dose context, operationally that can vary.</p>
