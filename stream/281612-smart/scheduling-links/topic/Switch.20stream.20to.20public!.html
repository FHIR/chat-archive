<p>Given <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/11/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-all-americans-to-be-eligible-for-vaccinations-by-may-1-puts-the-nation-on-a-path-to-get-closer-to-normal-by-july-4th/">last night's annoucements</a> on the subject of "Path to Get Closer to Normal by July 4th", I want to call attention to the following clear goal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find a Vaccination Website: By May 1st, as vaccines are available in more places, the <strong>Administration will launch a federally-supported website that will show the locations near them that have vaccines</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For transparency and to support broader conversation, I'm planning to open up this internal chat and make it public. Reviewing the history here, I don't have any concerns, but PM me if you'd rather I create a <em>new</em> channel rather than renaming this one and making it public.</p>
