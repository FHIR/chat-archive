<p>Probably different providers here have different experiences - but currently how long does an appointment generally stay available one it's released to book?</p>

<p>Especially since all states have had general availability (last few weeks)</p>

<p>Like Rob, for Vaccine Spotter, I'm not a first-party source of data, but for all the data I do have, it gets published ~every minute (but some of the data may be older, depending on when data was last gathered from specific pharmacies).</p>
<p>But to your original question, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="396676">@Amy Quispe</span>, I'm not totally sure how long appointments stay open. I have some historical data that could possibly be used to look at this, at least based on appointment information I've been able to gather from the outside (<a href="https://www.vaccinespotter.org/api/#historical">https://www.vaccinespotter.org/api/#historical</a>), but I haven't really had a chance to dig into this myself yet (I think some folks in HHS were looking into this historical data; not sure if they've done anything with it yet, but happy to point you in their direction if it would help). Purely anecdotally, as I'm sure many others have seen, earlier on, appointments seemed like they could disappear in less than a minute, particularly in more populated areas. But now it seems like appointments are sticking around much longer (but not sure if that's due to increased supply or decreasing demand).</p>
