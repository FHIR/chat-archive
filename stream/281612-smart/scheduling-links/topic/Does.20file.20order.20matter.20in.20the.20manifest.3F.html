<p>For the <a href="https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/smart-scheduling-links/blob/master/specification.md">smart scheduling links spec</a>, does or should the order of files matter?  Specifically, should all Location files come first, then all Schedule, then all Slot?  or can you do groups of Location/Schedule/Slot?  I think from the spec the order isn't specified, I just don't know if some clients might have a strong preference for them to be ordered by resource type.</p>

<p>The order of files shouldn't matter; expectation is that clients can tell the types, and can fetch in any order they want (and clients understand that Slots depend on Schedules which depend on Locations).</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191764">@Cooper Thompson</span> does this make sense, and would you want explicit language to this effect?</p>

<p>That does make sense, I was just double checking.  My opinions are in constant turmoil as I move between the highly capable folks in the FHIR community and the naïve (or hurried) app developers that are just trying to get code out the door and don't fully digest the implicit assumptions in specs.</p>
<p>Since this is a targeted use case (for now), I'm going to believe we don't need language.  And really, adding more language like that just makes the spec longer and means it's more likely to be skimmed over.</p>
