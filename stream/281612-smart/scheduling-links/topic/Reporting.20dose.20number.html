<p>We've had a bunch of discussion on <em>how</em> to represent the dose number in this <a href="https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/smart-scheduling-links/issues/36">github issue</a>.  However, I'm curious how valuable the community thinks having a dose number in the capacity reporting really is.   I expect most patients will schedule their second dose while they are getting their first dose, so that reduces (significantly I think) the value of reporting second dose capacity.  I have seen that some folks aren't getting their second dose, so maybe there is some utility for reporting second dose for folks that initially skipped their second dose.</p>

<p>Interestingly, getting accurate capacity <em>with dose number</em> is actually tricky for us, so I'm trying to gauge from the community how much effort we should invest (short term) to report dose number.</p>

<p>I don't have much data-driven feedback on this. Wondering if <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="396676">@Amy Quispe</span> has a perspective? Overall I expect that getting to granular appointment timing annotated with specific products is more important than annotating with "dose #" especially if the dose # is hard to know. But I'm very interested in understanding what makes this hard to know -- is it because organizations don't have a good process for allocating vaccine doses across dose 1 vs dose 2 appointments? Or ... they have a process but it's not easy to apply?</p>
