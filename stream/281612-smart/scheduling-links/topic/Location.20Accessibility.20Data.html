<p>The <a href="http://vaccines.gov">vaccines.gov</a> team is looking into adding more filters to our search experience. We would like the public to be able to filter their search results by amenities like wheelchair access, interpreter services, waiting rooms, etc. We hope that by adding these features to the site, the public can better find a vaccination location that meets their needs. </p>
<p>As part of our research efforts, we want to understand what kind of location amenity data pharmacies and other providers already maintain. Can the pharmacy/provider folks here speak to the kind of accessibility data they maintain for their locations? </p>
<p>If you'd like to share directly, you can email me at <a href="mailto:alexander.c.hoover@omb.eop.gov">alexander.c.hoover@omb.eop.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>This would be great! We have some initial thoughts/discussion at <a href="https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/smart-scheduling-links/issues/21">https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/smart-scheduling-links/issues/21</a> and <a href="https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/smart-scheduling-links/pull/24">https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/smart-scheduling-links/pull/24</a> (Alex has weighed in on those discussion, and it'd be great to carry this forward).</p>
