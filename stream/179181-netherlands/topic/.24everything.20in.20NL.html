<p>Looking at <a href="http://build.fhir.org/patient-operation-everything.html">http://build.fhir.org/patient-operation-everything.html</a> , the Us realm defines the scope of the data returned to be USCDI. Should we/have we define the scope of $everything in the Dutch realm to be the BgZ or some other set of ZIBs ?</p>

<p>BGZ does not seem right, only hospitals implement that - not GP's, pharm, midwifes etc. I don't know of any other zib set that would fit (except the set of all zibs, which in FHIR terms amounts to "all resources").</p>

<p>Is there a GP BgZ ? The union of those ZIBs with the Hospital BGZ ZIBS could at least serve as starter.. although there will be conflicting requirements for some FHIR resources (which one will then need to be sent twice, according to 2 different profiles).</p>

<p>You could argue that Professional Summary (PS) largely bears the same purpose as the BgZ. It is however a different set of 'stuff'. Conceptually it is at the same level. There is also a Patient Summary which differs from the PS a little bit.</p>

<p>BgZ in mental health is called BgGGZ. BgZ in long term care is called BgLZ. GPs have a Professional Summary (geared towards out-of-hour services). BgZ as Marc pointed out only really applies to hospital settings. </p>
<p>The GP PS could in future be defined under a BgXX title now that zibs 2020 have been released. The current PS is zib-free. The zibs 2020 release contains all (?) zibs relevant for GPs.</p>

<p>If you are hinting at the difference in paradigm where IPS is document oriented and BgZ is not: we have a bridge to cross there. I do not know what the answer there is, partly because nobody asked before. You might consider document oriented approach for push and separate resources for pull, but too soon to tell I think</p>

<p>No, that was not my point. The point is that at some time we'll need some generic Bg<em>Z, and IPS is generic. Tongue in cheeck: use the IPS models to reverse engineer a truly generic Bg</em>Z. The US has USDCI, yet we don't have a generic Bg*Z. As long as we dont have that we wont really be able to pin down $everything.</p>

<p>Well the BgZ was modeled after the sum of CCR/CCD/CCDA/epSOS/IPS. Functionally we're all good. Mostly differences in terminology systems. Do you mean technically? </p>
<p>Or maybe more precise what would that generic Bg*Z look like in your mind?</p>

<p>Something that's not specific to hospitals, GPs, or some other sector in healthcare. If our curent BgZ is really a 'BgZ just for hospitals', then where's the 'true BgZ' ?</p>

<p>BgZ was never meant specifically for hospitals, but because the hospital people created it, it turned out that way (I think).</p>
<p>Note that CCR/CCD/CCDA/epSOS/IPS are likely to serve hospitals better too than longterm care, mental health or GPs. So I'm not sure we are doing so poorly.</p>
<p>Maybe a one size fits all Patient Summary does not exist? Since I'm not aware of any work in compartments nor $everything in NL: where do you think this conversation is useful to have?</p>

<p>Bumping an old thread, but something I came across again just recently. Since there is no clear definition of the $everything in the standard, we do need to specify it in a dutch IG. In my opinion HL7 NL WGM could be the place to have this conversation. HL7 NL could be the organization to define the dutch specification in my opinion.</p>

<p>:-) very fast to respond René... I wouldn't try to scope it to any current specification of datasets. As was said earlier, none are useful in all usecases. My thought would be that the specification would define what is part of the medical record. I'm not an expert on that subject though..</p>

<p>The easy answer is: "the Patient compartment as defined by FHIR". However, the functional "union of all [basic] ZIBs and/or Gegevenssets" would be nice as well, but quite what that is, now that's a nice question (not for HL7 by the way, but for an organization like Nitciz).</p>

<p>Another could be (this was set up as a usecase in a demo..): Patient makes an appointment at GP's office and the GP would complete their dossier by requesting all new information from another healthcare provider to update their own starting from the last time the patient had an appointment.</p>

<p>you will never be able to express all the policies that would forbid data from flowing. policies that might be triggering on Consent, might be triggering on PurposeOfuse, might be triggering on legitimate relationship, might be triggering on relatedPerson... there will be policies that will filter out some data.

<p>I was reacting to the statements of the definition of $everything. Everything to one person is less than everything to another person. Consent allows the patient to restrict some data for some purposes. And patients are not the only source of restrictive policies. Medical practice has some safety reasons to restrict data. etc.... Thus the definition of $everything is.... all the data that the requestor is authorized to get. This might bluntly be everything, it might bluntly be nothing, it might be anything between.</p>

<p>so the "not defined in FHIR core" is referring to the sub-set policy is not defined. The technical definition of $everything is there. Just not the policy.</p>
