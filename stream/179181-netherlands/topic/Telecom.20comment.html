<p>Hi<br>
As you have come further in your national profiling than us in Sweden, we thought it would be a good idea to ask you about another Swedish requirement that we see should be a international one. </p>
<p>In our national MPI service there is support for a <em>Comment</em> along with a telephone number. Comments together with phone and email is also supported widely in Swedish EHRs. </p>
<p>Did you consider telecom.comment when you did your patient profile? We cannot find any standard extension for it.</p>

<p>What would be examples of the information captured as a comment? Doesn't sound familiar to me as a Dutch use case..</p>

<p>Could be many. A comment together with a phone number could be things like "dont call after 5 pm". So I dont see it as a requirement that is specific to one country at least. We would need an extension for it, just wondered if you had considered it. I'll create a ticket for it, I suspect others may need it later.</p>

<p>No this has not come up for us. I can see the use case theoretically so I'll support it when it comes up</p>
