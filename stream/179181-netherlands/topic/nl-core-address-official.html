<p>Hi<br>
We are at the moment in the process of doing a Swedish profile for patient and also have a need to state that an address is "Official". We see that Nictiz has created the extension nl-core-address-official to state this. We would like to use that extension in our swe core profile instead of creating a new one. We see that it contains information that is specific to a Dutch context, which if this extension should be used internationally, maybe belongs in each countries national profile?</p>
<p>What is your intention with this extension, is it to make it available for others as well, or only to use it in a Dutch context? </p>
<p>Regards<br>
Martin</p>

<p>Good question. We have not yet considered taking this one international, but now that I know that we have a combined interest: I say let's do just that. One of us should create a ticket for FHIR Core on the Address datatype and propose a new core extension. Do you? Do I? Are you at Montreal if possible to discuss if it makes the agenda?</p>

<p>Yes. I mean - you can make the extension generic in a collaborative effort. <br>
Having it adopted as a core extension is a separate concern.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191375">@Alexander Henket</span> , unfortunately not in Montreal :) <br>
Great that you agree with the approach of having an international extension! Maybe it's better if you create the ticket as it is you that have created the extension? You can at least refer to the same requirement coming from Sweden. </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191335">@Martijn Harthoorn</span> ,  is there a structured way of declaring the intent for an extension? We have also created/are in the process of creating extensions that we really see being international. We also try to keep those generic in terms of metadata.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="197234">@Martin Grundberg</span>. I've rewritten our original extension a little to make it more generic. Things that came to mind: </p>
<p>in our context it is completely clear what official registry is meant. Hence a boolean is enough for us. Would that hold in your context too?</p>
<p>the boolean is min=1 and also has a meaningWhenMissing which looks like an error in thinking in the original. The intention of the meaningWhenMissing is to say what it means when you omit the whole extension, but currently it lives on the boolean element inside the extension. I've left that intact for now.</p>
<p>For us it is irrelevant when it became officially registered. Hence there's no timestamping.</p>
<p>Could you check to see if this works for you? <a href="user_uploads/10155/xtgOfBImqqIhFNpMApMsaRGs/address-official.xml" target="_blank" title="user_uploads/10155/xtgOfBImqqIhFNpMApMsaRGs/address-official.xml">address-official.xml</a></p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191375">@Alexander Henket</span>!</p>
<p>In a Swedish context a person can be officially registered at one (and only one) address. This is the address that e.g. you will receive mail from governmental agencies, police, tax agency, insurance companies etc. It is also the address you will find if you search for a person's address details on various online address search services.  It is not the same as a "Home address" as a person can live in two places, and have two "Home addresses", but one of them would be the "official" address. </p>
<p>Regarding your questions:<br>
- Boolean is fine with us as well, it matches our requirements above<br>
- I'm a bit unsure if 0..1 or 1..1 is better. If I interpret it correctly, having 1..1 means you can never be uncertain about whether an address is the official address? That seems to me be a potential use case. Patient gives their address, and later it is found that it is the official address. My feeling is also that restraining 1..1 could be done on a profile level, and leave the extension 0..1 for more flexibility. Thoughts? <br>
-Timestamping is not needed for us either</p>
<p>A question back to you:<br>
- Can you have multiple Dutch official addresses? As mentioned above, Swedes can't, so I suspect we would use a constraint of some sort.</p>

<p>The extension has context Address, so it is available for every element with datatype Address. This would mean that using the extension is sort of relative to the resource. Patient.address and Practitioner.address would have a different connotation.</p>
<p>We assume that if the 'official status' of an Address is unknown, then the extension would just not be used. The 'official status' extension is present when it is a known true|false, hence 1..1 Boolean. Would that work for you too?</p>
<p>We don't a have a 'master file' issue. There's only one official registry for a persons address and you can have only one. There's also only one registry for a business' official address. For businesses the official address maybe have limited use as businesses can have many locations. In practice the official marker is only relevant for private addresses. The person/business registries are not the same registries by the way.</p>

<p>There is no issues in Sweden either regarding master files, this is a nationally held official address. And all healthcare organisations will be integrated with an external MPI that contains information about the (nationally) official address. So setup seems very similar to yours. </p>
<p>We were thinking of including this extension as part of the national core profile, so hence it would always be used when communicating Patient data. But I guess we could just put 0..1 on the extension itself in the patient profile and the boolean could be 1..1? </p>
<p>When it comes to organizational addresses I dont think we will use this extension there, but need to look into that.</p>

<p>This same notion appears in multiple other countries as well. Enough to justify a 'registered' code in the standard address use value set, I think</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191316">@Grahame Grieve</span> In V3 we mark names  as official using name/@use = 'OR'. This is not supported by the FHIR datatype, but perhaps that would skip the need for the extension.</p>

<p>I see the issue was reassigned from FHIR-I to MnM and MnM has a documented concern in their minutes, not yet in the issue <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/MnM/MnM+Minutes+WGM+201905+Montreal" target="_blank" title="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/MnM/MnM+Minutes+WGM+201905+Montreal">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/MnM/MnM+Minutes+WGM+201905+Montreal</a>. </p>
<p><em>concern is what if it is orthogonal to 'home' and 'work' (ie. is it the 'official' home address, 'official' work address?)</em></p>
<p>That sounds like a valid concern in a sense, but never stopped us before in V3. In V3 we only marked that the official person registry has this address connected to this particular person. Our registry only contains primary home addresses (one and only one, even though you might have multiple properties to your name). Not sure how that plays out in other countries.</p>
<p>The same address may or may not be a 'work-from-home' type of work place, but that goes into a different registry (Chamber of Commerce). You could, but we never do, mark Organization.address, Location.address or Practitioner.address etc with the proposed code/extension.</p>
<p>So maybe to distinguish home-official/work-official/billing-official we may need multiple codes instead of just one  to exactly that end?</p>

<p>The concepts of “home official”, “work official” etc does not exist in Sweden, or is at least not in practical use.</p>
<p>The address is official, whether you live there or not. Of course, you could argue that if you live at the official address it should be home+official, but I think that will add unnecessary confusion. You may not even know if the patient lives there, but it does not matter . Of course normally it would be assumed that you live there, and if you live at some other place that would more be considered some type of temporary address, or you have moved and are waiting for that to become your new official address. If you live at several places one of them would still be your official one.</p>
<p>So, in a Swedish context at least, information about Home, Work etc is not applicable if the address is Official.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar for us. The address is considered to be your primary address, suitable for official snail mail for example. If you own property in other places that's fine, but the primary address is where your tax mail will go for example. Considering that it is as civilian registry the thing it most most resembles is a home address, but the home/work status is really irrelevant.</p>

<p>same for DK - there's one primary address for your snailmail. We do however have a national project that leaves room for the actual use of temporary addresses if you eg. live somewhere else for a period (week or month I would guess)</p>

<p>A holiday and work-swamped days prevented me from seeing this earlier. I've added a couple of cents that are hopefully useful. Is this to be discussed in Atlanta? I'll be in Atlanta next week.</p>

<p>I don't think we discussed the use case of saying "<strong>not</strong> the official address in jurisdiction X". Indeed you would need a complex extension with 2 parts something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;extension</span> <span class="na">url=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/official-Address&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;extension</span> <span class="na">url=</span><span class="s">&quot;boolean&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;valueBoolean</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;false&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/extension&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;extension</span> <span class="na">url=</span><span class="s">&quot;country-or-region&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;valueCodeableConcept&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;coding&gt;</span>
                <span class="nt">&lt;system</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;urn:iso:std:iso:3166&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
                <span class="nt">&lt;code</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;IT&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
                <span class="nt">&lt;display</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;Italy&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;/coding&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/valueCodeableConcept&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/extension&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/extension&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I think the boolean part would be required (1..1) and the country-or-region part optional or even repeating (0..*)?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191320">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-20743" target="_blank" title="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-20743">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-20743</a> discusses how to mark Address as 'official'. As far as I can see the resolution has not led to an extension just yet. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="191415">@Giorgio Cangioli</span>, added a use case to the decision reached in the ticket that could be considered:</p>
<p>The ticket proposes:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;extension</span> <span class="na">url=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/official-Address&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;valueBoolean</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;true&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
or
    <span class="nt">&lt;valueCodeableConcept&gt;</span>
        <span class="c">&lt;!-- CodeableConcept e.g. iso code --&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/valueCodeableConcept&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/extension&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This would not allow to be specific about non-official addresses. You could solve that by making the extension one level deeper:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;extension</span> <span class="na">url=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/official-Address&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;extension</span> <span class="na">url=</span><span class="s">&quot;boolean&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;valueBoolean</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;false&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/extension&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;extension</span> <span class="na">url=</span><span class="s">&quot;country-or-region&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="c">&lt;!-- CodeableConcept e.g. iso code --&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/extension&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/extension&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Would that be something that could be considered somewhere?</p>

<p>Sure.  Submit a new tracker item and reference the original.  That said, sending a flag with false seems odd to me.  Wouldn't it make more sense to just flag the ones that are true?</p>

<p>In italy we have two types of home addresses (that in general are coincident) ("domicilio" where you actually live and "residenza" were you officialy live). Residenza is important for knowing which region will pay for your care...</p>
