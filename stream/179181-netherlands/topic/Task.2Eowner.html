<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Last week I had a discussion about the element <strong>Task.owner</strong>.</p>
<p>In the FHIR definition they say : "Individual organization or Device currently <strong>responsible </strong>for task execution."<br>
In the FHIR Requirement they say: "Identifies who is expected to <strong>perform </strong>this task."</p>
<p>The problem what I have is that the responsibility of a task, is another actor then who performs the task.<br>
E.g: a patient performs a task, but is not the owner or responsible for the task, that is, in my opinion a Practitioner or a dedicated Healthcare team.</p>
<p>Are my thoughts on the task owner wrong and where can I put the real owner of a task?</p>

<p>The expectation is that owner is 'who is supposed to ensure it gets done'.  If they delegate the work, that's fine.  There is no ability to have more than one individual linked though.  If a Task is assigned to someone who then asks someone else to do it, the owner would change.</p>
