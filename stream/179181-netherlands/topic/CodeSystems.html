<p>I am working on implementing the HCIM's and I don't know how to handle the lack of CodeLists in some cases, like in the <a href="https://zibs.nl/wiki/Problem-v4.1.1(2018EN)" target="_blank" title="https://zibs.nl/wiki/Problem-v4.1.1(2018EN)">Problem HCIM</a>. <br>
Here, the values for the Codelists for <em>ProblemName</em> and <em>ProblemAnatomicalLocation</em> are likely too large to even show on the wiki. Are these codelists already defined in HAPI or are there any other ways of comparing the values I find in XML's to external codelists? </p>
<p>To me, it seems that implementing all these codelists manually is a lot of work and I expect that there are more efficient ways of implementing these codelists. Because there are so many, ICD-10, SNOMED, NANDA-I, etc. and these are just for the Problem HCIM.</p>

<p>For SNOMED CT you should apply for a free license at the Nictiz NRC. ICD-10 comes from RIVM, others from respective owners. There is absolutely no way that we can distribute those as MedMij as we do not own the rights, nor does the ZIB Board that decided to include them. They are however code systems that may be expected from an information system, otherwise they would not have been included by the ZIB Board.</p>
<p>Shall any information system have an implementation for any code system in the ZIB? No. Systems are expected to code problems using relevant code systems in their context. So for financial and quality purposes ICD-10 comes to mind. For care NANDA/Omaha comes to mind. For clinical use SNOMED CT comes to mind. SNOMED CT also comes with mapping reference sets to various systems, like ICD-10 so interrelation is sometimes possible. NANDA/Omaha have not been mapped to SNOMED CT to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p>You are working on a PHR: you are unfortunately on the receiving end of anything that happens around you at the healthcare provider side. It is therefor understandably hard to implement every system your providers may have used to provide you with healthcare. You will have to do some prioritization. My best advice here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider the contexts you are going focus on and investigate which code systems are relevant there first</li>
<li>Very likely for Problem, you will need SNOMED CT first and ICD-10 second because the BgZ is retrieved from Cure context, not Care</li>
<li>Also consider a system you may not have looked at yet: ICPC-1 NL for problems in General Practitioner context. General Practitioners are not covered by HCIMs at present and hence their systems are not always covered yet</li>
</ul>
