During a training session, I recently updated our create-react-app template, that builds an app using the BFF (backend for frontend) pattern: <a href=\"https://github.com/Vermonster/fhir-kit-create-react/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Vermonster/fhir-kit-create-react/\">https://github.com/Vermonster/fhir-kit-create-react/</a> -- it should even work on Windows now (assuming you have bash/WSL).
