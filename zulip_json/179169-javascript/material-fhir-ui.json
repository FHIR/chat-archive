I really like the javascript libraries for FHIR and think it provides some great advantages over other languages in terms of rapid development, ease of hosting, and developer productivity. What you've done with your material-fhir-ui library is awesome and I'm excited to try it out. From my notes I didn't get a link to your slides - are your slides going to be available on the devdays site?</p>",

Observation resource is next up; then the Terminology components.  Once we get R4 normative resources in place, I think the plan is to pause and get a Storybook config set up.  More details on that in a bit.</p>",
