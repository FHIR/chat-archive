There was an update JSON Schema library published during the working group session this past week, with updated $ref statements and $ids, with some reported success that validators are parsing the schemas in both .Net and Javascript.  I'm working on publishing them to NPM now.  And we can also look at updating the Typescript definitions.  We may simply need to add removal of the circular dependencies for the Typescript defs as a step to the tooling publication pipeline.</p>",
