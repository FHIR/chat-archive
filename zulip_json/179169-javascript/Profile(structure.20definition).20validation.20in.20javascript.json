        "content": "<p>The standard JAR validator supports both XML and JSON (reading the resources from files). You could thus, in theory, write the data you want to validate to file and trigger the JAR from node.js (using, it seems, the <code>spawn()</code> method).  However, it would probably be more elegant to set up a HAPI FHIR server, feed it the profiles you want to validate against, and then call <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/validation.html#op\">the $validate endpoint</a> via HTTP from node.js.</p>\n<p>There is, AFAIK, no existing JS libs that will allow full validation based directly on StructureDefinition. There has been some discussion of generating JSON Schemata from StructureDefinition (though that cannot support all features of profiles) but again, I am not aware of any tools that actually do this.</p>",
