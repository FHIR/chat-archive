There seems to be growing interest in JS/TS tooling (myself included), from implementers who are new to FHIR but experienced in other ways. Especially with the TypeScript definitions work <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191782\">@Brian Kaney</span> released into DefinitelyTyped, I think there's a big opportunity for us to improve what's offered to developers in this space</p>\n<p>Being new, I'm not sure what the etiquette is here, but I'd like to propose the creation of a JS Language User Group. I'm not sure if the FHIR community has a format for such things, but I think there's a need to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Co-ordinating JS resources for the \"new to FHIR\" audience</li>\n<li>Collaborating on JS/TS infrastructure we need as a community</li>\n<li>Generally build bridges between JS users in FHIR</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, who's interested? Is there a group already? If not, is there a format for them generally or if it's a choose your own adventure I could propose some parameters.</p>",

To be clear, I am not proposing any communication technology change. I am hoping to collaborate on JS/TS FHIR tool projects and to talk more about how we can improve the implementer experience together.</p>\n<p>Some communities have working groups that are formal co-ordination points for \"language/user group\" activity - if that's what this stream already is, I'm happy to say just be saying hello and continuing the conversation started at DevDays :)</p>",

The Meteor build pipeline supports TypeScript, so we should be able to add a reference and pull the type definitions in without much difficulty.  It will be another few years yet before the core boilerplate migrates away from ECMAScript, but package authors should be able to have a relatively TypeScript centric experience as soon as those definitions are pulled in.  Either through NPM or Atmosphere.</p>",
