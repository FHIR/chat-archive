One of the <em>major</em> upgrades from it's predecessor Meteor on FHIR.  </p>\n<p>The dependency you're looking for is <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@asymmetrik/node-fhir-server-core\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@asymmetrik/node-fhir-server-core\">@asymmetrik/node-fhir-server-core</a>, which can be pulled into different Node apps.  Importantly, you can run Node on FHIR as a server, and connect to it from a separate client; or you can use Node on FHIR as an application server and connect to another FHIR repository.  It's completely decoupled, compared to the tightly coupled DDP interface we had in Meteor on FHIR.   This was probably the most important reason for us doing a project rewrite and basically doing a 2.0.</p>\n<p>Regarding <code>_has</code> and <code>_include</code> support, that's a question for the Asymmetrik folks.  They support the operations framework, and have documentation on creating custom operations.  So, it should be able to get the job done.  But it's a good question, and worth tracking as an issue until we can get a confirmed answer.  <br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Asymmetrik/node-fhir-server-core/blob/master/docs/CustomOperations.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Asymmetrik/node-fhir-server-core/blob/master/docs/CustomOperations.md\">https://github.com/Asymmetrik/node-fhir-server-core/blob/master/docs/CustomOperations.md</a></p>",

The Asymmetrik library appears to be written in CommonJS and uses <code>require</code> statements, so... I would lean on 'yes/maybe' it will give hiccups and you'll need to edit your webpack config.  At the same time, pretty sure that there's a webpack config out there in the world that would support the CommonJS, since it's an older technology.  So yes on both.  Yes on problems and hiccups; but also yes that it can be done.  </p>\n<p>We spent a lot of time working those details out in the Meteor community, and have upstream tech leads at the Meteor Development Group that have spent a fair bit of time trying to get ES6 and CommonJS and a dozen other technologies all working together.
