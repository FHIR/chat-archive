I just wanted to get feedback here and FHIRCAST as the architecture overlaps  both areas.</p>\n<p>Heres what i am doing currently:</p>\n<p>Clients pull over HTTP.<br>\nSevers push over SSE. </p>\n<p>My setup is  basically a GraphQL Architecture:</p>\n<p>On the Client they make a HTTP request ( REST or Grpahql). When they make the request they indicate if they want a real time view ( aka subscription).<br>\nOn the Server, the request is served and response sent, and the FHIR Models are watched via nosql Materialised Views and the changefeed goes to whomever has already make a previous HTTP Query . I just keep a virtual router list of who subscribed to what.  <br>\nUnder the hood is a Message broker that runs to make it scale out and allow failures and upgrades of the Servers without any clients having any downtime. Hence why its highly async, and hence why pure unidirectional async network transport for Subscriptions allows things to be decoupled. Makes geo physical load balancing much easier too.</p>\n<p>In terms of UX,  the GUI / CLI clients get a real time feed, and so we can do real time collaboration and never have old data on clients. </p>\n<p>For Other FHIR Servers how do they want to be told ?  Webhooks  maybe .</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Also what about  Compliance  ? how do i check that our system works with other FHIR systems ?</p>\n<p>I am using feature flags quite a bit so that we can innovate but also be compliant. <br>\nPresume the headers tell me the things talking to me also ? </p>\n<p>Sorry about the avalanche of questions. Its my first post on this forum, and so have a few things that i know i dont know.</p>",

        "content": "<p>No worries <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196630\">@Ged Webb</span> , this is a great place to ask questions.</p>\n<p>I'll start with saying that's an interesting architecture.  I think it can be built in such a way that it is compliant with 'standard' clients and still provide all the functionality you describe.</p>\n<p>For compliance, I'll start by noting I'm no authority on the topic  =).  I believe the main testing tool of interest for REST testing is <a href=\"https://inferno.healthit.gov/\">Inferno</a>.  As long as you are following guidance on the <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html\">RESTful API</a> page, it should be straightforward.</p>\n<p>Moving into GraphQL quickly moves out of my experience.  There is the relevant <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/graphql.html\">GraphQL</a> page, but I do not know if there are any testing tools available.  I would suggest the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"192326\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/192326-graphql\">#graphql</a> stream for information there.</p>\n<p>On the subscription side, I have more thoughts.  Obviously, these are from looking at your description for a few minutes so I'd advise taking it with a grain of salt.</p>\n<p>With disclaimers out of the way, I'll start with a little history - the initial versions of FHIR Subscriptions were closer to what you are describing.  There was no topic resource, clients simply registered for subscriptions based on queries and the server notified on changes to result sets.  Overall, there ended up being enough issues with that design that a major overhaul was necessary (it worked <em>great</em> for some use cases, but did not work <em>at all</em> for others - there's a lot of content about all of that history available, so I won't rehash it here).</p>\n<p>With the changes in R5 (and the Backport IG to support R4B), FHIR Subscriptions became topic-based.  With that in mind, there's a bit of a tree in deciding how you want to go about it, e.g.:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>topic rooting<ul>\n<li>topics are content-based (e.g., 'Observations for this patient', etc.).</li>\n<li>topics are meta-based (e.g., 'Queries for this client', etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>number of topics<ul>\n<li>single topic (e.g., all queries for this client)</li>\n<li>multiple topics (e.g., each query for a client)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>who creates topics<ul>\n<li>client</li>\n<li>server</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And so on..</p>\n<p>You should hopefully be able to follow any of the paths and arrive at a working system (that's been a goal we've all worked hard on at least, I cannot guarantee we haven't missed anything).</p>\n<p>In terms of UX, so far the push has been Websockets, with the idea that an active client is subscribed to whatever array of topics the client is interested in (e.g., medication dispenses, patient discharges, etc.) with filters established on the subscriptions (e.g., 'medication dispenses' in this ward, 'patient discharges' from this location, etc.).  I'll also note that servers can send 'recent' events after a subscription is started in case overlap is desired and that if a server supports the <code>$events</code> operation, a client can also ask for recent events without running a new query.  I actually think SSE would be great here, but it hasn't seen the level of adoption that websockets has overall.  Defining a custom channel is pretty straightforward, so this is an easy addition.</p>\n<p>For other servers, so far the concept has been rest-hook into that server.  We have a proposal for a <code>$publish</code> event to help make that consistent as well, but it is a relatively new proposal.</p>",
