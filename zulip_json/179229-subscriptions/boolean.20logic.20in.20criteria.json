I have a situation where I'm maintaining subscriptions on Consent registrations by patients. I won't get into the details of the use case, but I need to use boolean logic to specify the criteria for the Subscription. I need to be able to say: patient=X AND (class=A OR class=B OR provider=Y). I've read at <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/search.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/search.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/search.html</a> how the \"&amp;\" operator is used to apply a logical AND and how  the \",\" separator is used to apply a logical OR, but it seems &amp; can only be used if the subcriteria apply to the same search parameter and , can only be used to separate a list of values for the same search parameter. </p>\n<p>The example I see in the text is \"Patient?language=FR,NL&amp;language=EN\" for patient speaks English and at least one of French or Dutch. In my example, I'm dealing with three different search parameters that need to be combined in a logical expression. Any advice on how to do that?</p>",
