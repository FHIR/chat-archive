I am happy to put together a track proposal and either lead or co-lead a subscriptions track.  However, given the time zone of this meeting I am not sure I will be able to flex my schedule enough to be available across all of the intended times.</p>\n<p>So, if you're interested in <em>attending</em> a Subscriptions track, please leave a <span aria-label=\"thumbs up\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f44d\" role=\"img\" title=\"thumbs up\">:thumbs_up:</span> on this message.  If you are interested in helping <em>run</em> the track (particularly in the EU times), please either comment or message me.  Thanks!</p>",
