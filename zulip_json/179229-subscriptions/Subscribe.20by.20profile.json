I just realized that searching on the _profile is required for all resources. So I can get what I need (in theory) with something like this:<br>\n<code>\"Observation?_profile=http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/phd/StructureDefinition/PhdNumericObservation\";</code><br>\nBut I didn't think to look at the self-link to see what search it actually invoked.</p>",

When it comes to searching, I am a total greenhorn. I have been uploading my entire life and have not given much of a thought to what the guy on the other end has to do. I want to exercise the Device resource so I thought it prudent to make a simple 'remote patient monitoring' app that subscribes to uploads generated by PHD IG gateways.</p>",
