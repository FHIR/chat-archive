CORS errors will show up in the JavaScript console in most browsers, so it's a good place to check if connections are failing that you expect to work.</p>\n<p>3) Need a big push on consolidating functionality/definitions with DaVinci Notifications so that we don't end up with two workflows doing (mostly) the same thing.  Will likely be arranging a small focus group first to sort through it, then present for broader feedback.</p>\n<p>4) I am lagging a bit on documentation and resource definitions.  Sorry, but in my defense - editing the core specs is painful.  I hope to have everything up to date (whatever that means) before Sydney.
