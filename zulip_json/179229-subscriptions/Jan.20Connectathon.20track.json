With a persistent UserSession you could, for example, bring clients up after each other and get them to the same state without having to initiate a sync from one of them. It also makes it possible to save a users's state, i.e. \"parking\" your work and get back to it later, perhaps on another workstation, bringing any other apps on that same workstation to the same context.</p>\n<p>Otherwise I agree that there are many benefits with it being a resource.</p>",
