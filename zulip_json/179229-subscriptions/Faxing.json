I'd say that either a) defining a custom channel type, or b) using a standard channel with a relay server (e.g., Josh's suggestion on email, a REST server that does the conversion, etc.) should be fairly straightforward.</p>\n<p>At first glance, I would say that the biggest difference is in how repeatable/consistent you want it to be.  Defining a channel type means establishing a standard representation of the data (even if it's something like build a PDF according to these rules), while doing a relay server means you can do whatever you want after receiving the notification (e.g., completely different representations/processes for each connection).</p>",
