Right now, the main branch has <code>Subscription</code> and <code>Topic</code>, from around the time of DevDays Europe.  Since then, we've moved <code>Topic</code> to <code>SubscriptionTopic</code>, added a 64-bit integer type, and made a lot of documentation updates.  I am also working on the changes to add a <code>SubscriptionStatus</code> resource and new bundle type (per feedback in Amsterdam).</p>\n<p>I have not merged that set of changes into the main branch yet, since I was hoping to batch all of them together.  If you would prefer the current contents of the <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/branches/argonaut-subscription/subscription.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/branches/argonaut-subscription/subscription.html\">argonaut-subscriptions branch</a> merged into the main build, I can do that.</p>\n<p>I am hoping to get <code>SubscriptionStatus</code> done soon, which would let me create all the relevant Jira issues and have it all discussed on a single FHIR-I call.</p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>",
