In order to not violate the \"principles\" of MQTT, it would likely need a different payload (given that normal payloads are FHIR bundles, which are 'large' for that protocol).  If someone implemented this on the server, they would likely map <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> resources into MQTT Topics as well, so the FHIR server could plug into the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>That said, it feels like a reach to me; I'm not sure what the use case for integrating with it would be (though I am curious).</p>",
