The patient compartment is some 60 FHIR resources, the vast majority of which we don't yet support (and have relatively low maturity).  Further, a \"patient's record\" is tens of thousands of discrete data elements that are simplified and mapped to FHIR (and other interoperable data models). Developers really don't want to hear about all of these changes, and even if they did the computational cost of informing them, without an additional abstraction layer (e.g. EventDefinition) is significant.</p>\n<p>A \"blue stream\" would definitely be valuable, but it doesn't immediately improve care or solve a pressing need of a health system.</p>",
