I got it working, but i feel I hacked my solution. <br>\nBasically, I was using type = rest-hook, which according to the spec, it expects a FHIR server on the other end - so I switched my endpoint to abide by a FHIR REST API, but it's not really a FHIR Server. <br>\nBecause my criteria is Encounter?status=finished, HAPI was calling  &lt;endpoint&gt; + /Encounter/{EncounterID}. Which makes total sense after reading the specs :-)</p>\n<p>so my question is - what's the best way to use FHIR subscription when your endpoint is NOT a FHIR server! Just an app interested in data</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hi Marcelo,</p>\n<p>I was able to create a subscription from a client that was not a FHRI server using Cerner's sandbox: <a href=\"https://github.com/MaxPhilips/wgm_notes/blob/jan_2019/subscriptions/test_server_faq.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/MaxPhilips/wgm_notes/blob/jan_2019/subscriptions/test_server_faq.md\">https://github.com/MaxPhilips/wgm_notes/blob/jan_2019/subscriptions/test_server_faq.md</a></p>\n<p>Can you elaborate on the how you got a notification on &lt;endpoint&gt; + /Encounter/{EncounterID} ?

        "content": "<p>Based on my reading of the spec there are two cases: 1. Subscription.channel.payload is not present, this would be interpreted as the subscription wants to receive data corresponding to the criteria. POSTs in this case would go to /Encounter or /Observation, or whatever the subscription is for. 2. Subscription.channel.payload is present, this would be interpreted as the subscription wants a notification for its owner to re-query and pull new data.</p>\n<p>In particular, for Cerner's connectathon server, we don't have different behaviors for those two scenarios - POSTs will always go to the endpoint as registered regardless of payload set or absent.</p>",

Would love to hear from Firely guys on this. It seems to me that HAPI is following the specs as I understood them.</p>\n<p>I think <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"195155\">@Max Philips</span> explained it well above, but I think is the opposite - if payload is present on my subscription, the entire contents are sent, otherwise - if payload is omitted - then only a \"ping\" will be sent and my server needs to query back the FHIR server that triggered the subscription, possibly with a _since filter to retrieve only records after my last ping.</p>",
