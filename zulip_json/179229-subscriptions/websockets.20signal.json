I do not think that is sufficient. The server also needs to send the logical id of the received resource that signaled the event. Think of this situation. I subscribe to all  Observations with subject=Patient/123. Then somewhere out there patient 123 uploads 100 measurements taken the past two day from a glucose meter. How am I as a subscription client able to ascertain which measurements these are?  There may be several other measurements already on the server,  perhaps taken the same day (say BP measurements) and my subscription client was not connected.</p>\n<p>IF the server sent at least the logical id of the resource that triggered the event, I would have an unambiguous means to obtain the correct resource.</p>",
