We will be working through Jira tickets based on <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/issues/?filter=13929\">this filter</a>, which should contain non-applied tickets from the backport IG ballot.</p>\n<p>I will continue working on proposed dispositions until the meeting in order to make the best use of time.  If anyone has a ticket they want promoted or removed, please let me know.  Additionally, if there are any questions or comments, please let me know.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
