I have committed one file, which I'd like to push to master. <br>\nSomeone else has pushed to master, so I have to pull. When I pull, I get a list of files that have changed - none of which I have actually changed. The differences is all whitespace related. Don't know the deal is.</p>\n<p>Anyway, 3 different git gui clients can't get rid of the damn files. Cannot stash them or abandon them, or revert them - whatever language they use. They let me do it, but the file never goes away. Git stash creates a stash.. but nothing changes. </p>\n<p>And, of course, git pull fails because I have these uncommitted files in the way....</p>",
