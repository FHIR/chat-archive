That works well, but it has a problem....</p>\n<p>The IGPublisher is current 95MB, and it's growing gradually, as people add dependencies. GitHub limit is 100MB, which is approaching soon, though I can't predict exactly when. At that point (or before) we will need some other approach... any ideas?</p>",
