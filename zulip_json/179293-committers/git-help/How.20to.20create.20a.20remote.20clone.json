        "content": "<p>One of the effects of the splitting of the HL7 code-base to have some of it live on hapifhir is that I can no longer just commit a branch to the FHIR github project and make a pull request.  Instead, I need to create a remote clone (on github) of the <a href=\"https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core\">https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core</a> repository.  However, I can't find any instructions on how to do that - everything I read about cloning tells me how to create a local clone.  But apparently I can't create a pull request from that.  So I need instructions on how to create a remote clone (that I can then create a local clone of, create a local branch, commit changes to my local branch, then push to my remote clone from which I can apparently create a pull request against the true source.  (This seems <em>so</em> much more complicated than it ought to be...)</p>\n<p>Can anyone provide such instructions/hand-holding?</p>",
