The build should <em>not</em> be using the end-of-line convention of the local build environment for files that are being committed - it should always use a standard convention (don't really care if that's Windows or Unix).  No human's edit these files - they're created automatically by the build process, so we should never get a conflict due to line endings.  (Though we will also get conflicts due to changed metadata such as the generation date - it would be nice if we could make that go away too...)</p>",
