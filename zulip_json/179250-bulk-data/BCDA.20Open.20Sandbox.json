Earlier this week, Administrator Verma mentioned the Beneficiary Claims Data API (BCDA) on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeemaCMS/status/1115642946676842497\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://twitter.com/SeemaCMS/status/1115642946676842497\">https://twitter.com/SeemaCMS/status/1115642946676842497</a>). Our team has launched an Open Sandbox environment where curious parties may make requests for synthetic bulk data and, hopefully, better understand the capabilities of BCDA. Learn more here: <a href=\"https://sandbox.bcda.cms.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://sandbox.bcda.cms.gov/\">https://sandbox.bcda.cms.gov/</a></p>\n<p>In an eventual production implementation, BCDA will allow Shared Savings Program ACOs to retrieve bulk beneficiary claims data for their assigned or assignable beneficiaries.</p>\n<p>You may also want to head over to BCDA's Google Group to learn more, share feedback and ask questions: <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bc-api\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bc-api\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bc-api</a></p>\n<div class=\"inline-preview-twitter\"><div class=\"twitter-tweet\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeemaCMS/status/1115642946676842497\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"twitter-avatar\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/951259828617469952/sfA3q-HW_normal.jpg\"></a><p>#ICYMI: At #HIMSS19 I announced the new Beneficiary Claims Data API, which will enable ACOs to retrieve bulk #Medicare Part A, Part B, &amp; Part D claims data for their aligned beneficiaries, providing a full picture of patient care.
