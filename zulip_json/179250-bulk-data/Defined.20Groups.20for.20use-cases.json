I know there are hypothetical use-cases for Bulk Export around pop health and the more obvious \"Practice Level\" Grouping , but I wanted to reach out to the community to see if there are other common Groupings that would be recommended to support. If not, we can start with a minimal approach and grow from there.</p>",
