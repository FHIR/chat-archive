IETF guidance ( <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6648\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6648\">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6648</a> ) deprecates the X- prefix for headers and instead recommends using a meaningful name with a reasonable expectation of being unused.</p>\n<p>As a note, the only reason I thought of it was because someone else brought it up during an Argonaut-Subscriptions call.</p>\n<p>In any case, something along the lines of fhir-bulk-export-progress may be more appropriate instead of the X-Progress name.</p>\n<p>Dan suggested posting here, so thanks!</p>",

Today: we're just talking about a naming convention, and I don't see any reason to break/change from <code>X-Progress</code>. Looking forward, as we define new headers, we should keep these conventions in mind.</p>",
