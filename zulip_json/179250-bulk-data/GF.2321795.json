As am implementer, I read it and I'm only 60% that I'm interpreting the description properly. An extra line or two saying \"For example, _type=Practitioner could be used to bulk data extract all Practitioner resources from a FHIR endpoint\" would be sufficient (or any other resource of your choice, aside from the Patient resource).</p>",
