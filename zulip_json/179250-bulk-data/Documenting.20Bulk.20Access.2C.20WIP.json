(We've found the standalone repo helpful for managing discrete issues and previewing changes early on, so I'd prefer not to try to converge on the main FHIR build at this stage.)</p>\n<p>The primary concern is that when we publish R4, we risk having async API docs that become stale very quickly, but nobody will have a good way to tell for 18+ months. I want to make sure we avoid this confusion.</p>\n<p>A couple of ideas that could help (but I'm very open to others!)</p>\n<p>1. We could hold the Bulk data operations back from the main FHIR build until we feel like they're a bit more stable <br>\n2. We could add a note to the <code>http.html#async</code> in the main FHIR build, indicating that this is early-stage work with detailed conversations happening in zulip + github, with a links to these</p>",
