We are working on adding bulk-data support to the sandbox servers but it will take a while.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the bulk-data server at <a href=\"https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org\">https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org</a> is great for testing clients but it simply does not output data that is good enough to feed into those pop-level apps.</p>\n<p>That is why we've decided to accelerate the process by exporting the data from the sandbox servers as NDJSON. Instead of waiting for usable bulk-data servers to be released, you can use these NDJSON files as if they were downloaded from a bulk-data export endpoint.</p>\n<p>The files are now publicly available at <a href=\"https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/flat-fhir-files\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/flat-fhir-files\">https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/flat-fhir-files</a></p>",

Please tell us if you would prefer to have the empty files removed from the repository. This would make it look more like a bulk data export and you won't have to filter them yourself, but it would also make it harder to determine what resources are empty.</p>",
