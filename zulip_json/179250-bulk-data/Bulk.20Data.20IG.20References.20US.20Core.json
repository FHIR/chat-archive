More specifically, we clarify that all data elements indicated as “mandatory” and “must support” by the proposed standards and implementation specifications must be supported and would be in scope for testing. Through this approach, certification will provide for a consistent and predictable starting scope of data from which apps and other services can be developed.<br>\nSEARCH SUPPORT<br>\nWe propose to require in § 170.315(g)(10)(ii) that the health IT presented for testing and certification must be capable of responding to all of the “supported searches” specified in the Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide Server, which as a reminder we have proposed for adoption as an implementation specification in § 170.215(a)(4). (89) Given that there is not yet a consistent, standardized specification for FHIR servers to handle searches for multiple patients, we clarify that a health IT developer would be permitted to approach searches for multiple patients in the manner it deems most efficient to meet this proposed certification criterion. We note, consistent with the implementation specifications current scope, that conformance would focus on search associated with a single patient's data. However, we reiterate the health IT presented for testing and certification and as implemented must support searches for multiple patients independent of a required standard for such searches.</p>\n</blockquote>",
