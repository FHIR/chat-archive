We've loaded this into an i2b2 datamart; the observation_fact table has over 70B facts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kumc-bmi/grouse\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kumc-bmi/grouse\">https://github.com/kumc-bmi/grouse</a></p>\n<p>Before that, we developed ETL from the KU Hostpital's Epic installation into i2b2. More like 3B observations on O(100K) patients.</p>\n<p>I'm trying to find related work with FHIR. The focus seems to be on writing mobile apps that query a FHIR service about one patient at a time. But how does the data get into the FHIR service? I'm looking at the docs for <a href=\"http://hapifhir.io/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hapifhir.io/\">http://hapifhir.io/</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/fhir-server\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/fhir-server\">https://github.com/Microsoft/fhir-server</a> and if there's documentation about how to get data in there in bulk, I don't see it.</p>\n<p>What am I missing? Clue me in, please?</p>",
