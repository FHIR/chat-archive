Is there a good way to implement membership based Group resources for really large patient populations? I'm thinking of scenarios like a particular organization's patient list, or all the patients enrolled by a particular payer. The Read operation on a Group like this will return an unmanageable payload size if members is populated. So are there plans to add/support some sort of resource continuation or paginated expand-type operation for really large resources?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
