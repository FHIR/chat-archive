I would expect the spec to say that the <em>server</em> MAY/SHOULD/MUST support these requests, but this wording reads more like \"the client might decide to poll the status\", which is sort of trivial as the client is never obligated to poll the status even if the server MUST support it. It left me uncertain on the intended requirement level.</p>",
