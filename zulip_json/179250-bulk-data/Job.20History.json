Wondering in BULK FHIR if there exists (or under consideration) a mechanism to request a <strong>job history</strong> e.g. a bundle/listing of previously requested jobs by the client - the output would return things like job id, status, date/time, etc.  We have clients, who for various reasons (auditing, reporting, lost ids, lack of automation) could use a history.  I looked thru current and STU2 versions of BULK FHIR spec and didn't see anything in this regard.  Any thoughts or advice on creating this call in a way that is conformant with BULK and/or FHIR would be much appreciated.  Thanks!</p>",

        "content": "<p>This hasn't come up before --- it's a good question. Could perhaps be modeled with a custom operation (e.g., <code>GET $export-jobs?status=pending</code>, returning a Bundle of Tasks or some-such). Or if you're going to model an export job as a Task, then this could be enabled using the RESTful search API on Tasks (e.g., <code>GET Task?code=export-job&amp;status=in-progress</code>).</p>",
