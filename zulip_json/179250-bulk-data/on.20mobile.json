This is super helpful. Is there a threshold for when the use of bulk data api becomes recommended/necessary? I'm guessing it's heavily context-dependent. But would love to hear what you think if you had to put a number on it.</p>\n<p>We are currently using the restful search api for importing data from the server but imagine that might not be sufficient in the long run. Also, although there is this \"small pipes\" constraint and we design for poor connectivity and offline use, the initial sync of data from server to mobile is going to be done in a context with good connectivity at least. Just saying it's not like we're going to have people in areas with poor mobile connectivity downloading GBs of data.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191315\">@Josh Mandel</span> I'm keen on the idea of using fhir protos as the wire format -- would love to explore and see how we can make some progress there.</p>",
