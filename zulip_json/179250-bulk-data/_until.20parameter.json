If we pair the <code>_since</code> parameter with another one called <code>_until</code> (or <code>_before</code> or whatever the best name is), then it would be possible to create clients that can \"fill in the gaps\" in the data that they already have.</p>\n<p>For example, if a client already has the data for 2019-2020 but wants to have everything starting from 2018</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently we have to pass <code>_since=2018</code> which works but re-exports the entire 2019</li>\n<li>Alternatively, we could split that to 2 exports and omit 2019: <code>_since=2018&amp;_until=2019</code> and <code>_since=2020</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, that could eliminate the need to make that huge first export, potentially reducing the load on servers.</p>",

IIRC, including _until was discussed on one of the Argonaut calls and the group ultimately concluded that while there are certainly use cases where it would be helpful (e.g., the rough pagination you mentioned, filling in a failed historical request), it didn't seem critical enough to most of the core bulk use cases to be worth expanding the number of params included in the IG.</p>",
