Over time, other \"FHIR\" futures like system-level export and capability statement were added and I had to do some patchwork to support them.  I even used to think that Bulk Data can be used to export arbitrary JSON data and not only FHIR resources, but by now it seems that this is no longer the case.

The FHIR spec, and other IGs like US Core seem to use a version number of x.x.1 for errata releases which aligns with the semantic versioning spec. If we make the version for the IG 1.1.0, won't people assume that the changes are material? Why have a three segment version at all if non-substantive error corrections don't use the third segment?</p>",
