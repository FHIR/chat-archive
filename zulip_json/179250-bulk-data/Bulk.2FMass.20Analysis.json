I am aware that the same can be performed when we deal with dat files for HL7v2.x using tools like HL7spy which gives you statistics in terms of bulk analysis. e.g. 1500 files do not have DG1 segment in the ADT files. Do we have an equivalent in the xml/json world. </p>\n<p>Thanks &amp; regards,<br>\nTushar</p>",
