Alternatively, one could output regular resources for the current resource versions plus history bundles for the past, to make it a superset of regular $export. But that's probably not what consumers of the data want as it wouldn't be round-trip compatible with POSTing history bundles, or an $import operation. It needs to be compatible with some way of getting the data imported on the other end.</p>\n<p>I would do $export with a history parameter rather than attaching it to the _history API. It will need all of the status checking, output locations, etc. functionality from $export.</p>\n<p>Filtering on $export may be more difficult as historical versions might not be indexed the same way as current versions.</p>",
