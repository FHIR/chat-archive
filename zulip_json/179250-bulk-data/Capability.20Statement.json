We have 2 different ones since they point to different authorize and manage endpoints.  Is this just an extension of what we are already supporting and bulk data doesn't have its own standalone capability statement that can be called?<br>\n2) but the above is not probably totally correct because when i go here (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/CapabilityStatement-bulk-data.json.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/CapabilityStatement-bulk-data.json.html</a>) I see example JSON for the bulk data capability statement.  So this is the capability statement that can be called?  This is just an example.  Where is the structure of the metadata response defined? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191315\">@Josh Mandel</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191414\">@Dan Gottlieb</span></p>",

That returns an \"instance\" kind of CapabilityStatement.  So it isn't an 'example' of something your server would send to clients, but rather a description of the requirements of a bulk data server (note the 'SHOULD' expectation codes in there).</p>",
