In 10 minutes I am presenting an orientation to the FHIR Citation Resource in the EBM/COKA Track, and then 2 hours later presenting in the FAIR Track about how we are implementing FAIR principles in the Evidence-related resources.</p>\n<p>With an example of an Evidence Resource <a href=\"https://computablepublishing.us/fevir/resources/Evidence/RemdesivirExampleWithSOLIDARITY?version=3\">https://computablepublishing.us/fevir/resources/Evidence/RemdesivirExampleWithSOLIDARITY?version=3</a> and an example of a Citation resource to cite this Evidence Resource <a href=\"https://computablepublishing.us/fevir/resources/Citation/36413\">https://computablepublishing.us/fevir/resources/Citation/36413</a> this can also be an example of the Citation resource being the metadata for this Evidence Resource.</p>\n<p>I found a table for RDA FAIR indicators and quickly mapped these examples to each of the indicators.  That table is available at <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ond_W2srnhIpFG3AATQpjwjSiz6oimaN/#gid=848164289\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ond_W2srnhIpFG3AATQpjwjSiz6oimaN/#gid=848164289</a> and I would like to use it at my FAIR presentation today for open discussion and adjustment.</p>",
