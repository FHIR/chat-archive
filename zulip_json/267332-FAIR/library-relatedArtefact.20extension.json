        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191415\">@Giorgio Cangioli</span> There may be a duplication of concepts if using a \"relatedContent\" element instead of \"content\" to enable use of RelatedArtifactF4F datatype instead of Attachment datatype.   The \"relatedContent\" or \"content\" elements conveys the relationship of \"composed-of\" (i.e. this content is part of the library), and then the RelatedArtifactF4F has a type element which requires a code which would be \"composed-of\".    Another solution, when desiring to represent Library.content data by reference instead of attachment, would be to just use Library.relatedArtifact and set type=\"composed-of\" -- when the relatedArtifact.type=\"composed-of\" for a Library resource it conveys you are using it for content without using the content element.   This is cleaner for resource expression (no additional extension for relatedContent) but it would require implementers to know to search this alternative method for finding Library.content</p>",
