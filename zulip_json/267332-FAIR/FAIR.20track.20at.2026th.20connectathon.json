In kick off session, we asked to the audience the following question: \"What is your opinion regarding the use of health data for research purposes PARPASIS following FAIR principles?\". Now, considering we are at the end of the event, we would like to collect answers of the same questions, to measure the FAIR awareness improvement reached thanks to this event. So, if you voted in kick off session, please, go to <a href=\"http://www.menti.com\">www.menti.com</a> and answer the question using the code 35 10 91 9. Thank you very much in advance.</p>",

I think Evidence.exposureBackground=  <a href=\"http://data.cochrane.org/ontologies/pico/Population\">http://data.cochrane.org/ontologies/pico/Population</a>;  Evidence.exposureVariant=Intervention; Evidence.outcome== <a href=\"http://data.cochrane.org/ontologies/pico/Outcome\">http://data.cochrane.org/ontologies/pico/Outcome</a>. It might be good to have an explicitly aligment</p>",

        "content": "<p>The Evidence Resource in R4 is not the structure where PICO ontology will be best mapped.  The Evidence Resource in R5 (and soon R4B) uses Evidence.variableDefinition with elements description, note, variableRole (to code the role eg population or exposure), observed, intended, and directnessMatch.  We then use EvidenceVariable Resources for the specific variable definitions, but can use Group Resource when the variable role is population or subpopulation to coordinate with other FHIR population descriptions using Group.  The EvidenceVariable and Group Resources could be mapped to PICO ontology instances.</p>",
