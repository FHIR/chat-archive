By my thinking, if you only support USCDI V1 data scope you can't fully support US Core 4.1.0. I was always assuming that SVAP would need to \"pair\" particular USCDI versions with corresponding US Core versions. Although, the different USCDI version tags thing is an interesting idea.</p>",

On the flipside, if you want to certify your APIs to a new USCDI version I still think there'll need to be a minimum US Core version attached to that as a dependency (e.g., USCDI V2 and US Core 4.1.0). But that's more of a topic for ONC.</p>",
