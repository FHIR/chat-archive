It's unclear what a root cardinality would mean - can I use a bag of medications instead of one? That seems counter to the 'relaxing the constraint' principle, intuitively. I ask because we have cases where an order for one medication may result in dispensing many, and I'd like to put them all in a single Dispense instance, but it looks like I may need several.</p>",

E.g. \"If you're going to declare support for this extension, minOccurs must be at least 1\" or \"If you declare support for this extension, it's not allowed to repeat\".</p>",
