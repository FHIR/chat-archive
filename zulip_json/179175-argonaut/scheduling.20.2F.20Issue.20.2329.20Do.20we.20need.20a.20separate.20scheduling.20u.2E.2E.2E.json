A scheduler looking at the new appointment won't have any context that it was rescheduled.</p>\n<p>It also introduces some complex failure states. What if the booking fails for some reason, but the previous appointment is already canceled? (which raises a larger question as to how failures should be handled in general)</p>\n</blockquote>",
