Far more than the technical implementation, it will be critical to understand how health systems would want to receive these requests. E.g., some may want them to go to the Medical Records/HIM department for triage, at which point they would send a formal request to the correct party to make the change. It's hard to know how patients might use this - some submissions might be true errors while others might be disagreements or simply misunderstandings. We should start as simply as possible until the variety of use cases becomes clear. More structured input might be useful for some cases (like medications, per <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191315\">@Josh Mandel</span>), but until the provider workflow for this particular request is well understood, the value of more structure vs prose isn't clear to me.</p>",

I think a 'standardized' workflow leveraging Task might be interesting, but it is not likely to inspire those organizations that are not today providing the ability for a patient to submit a change request.   The best this could do is provide a reference-model. This reference-model would be helpful in leading the way. In a very distant future one could imagine apps and patient workflows that could automate the (bad) data selection with rational on why it is bad and specific instructions on desired change being requested. However in the near future this is far more likely to be local organization specific patient portal forms such as Jenni refers to. --- so I think this is interesting, but not realistic.
