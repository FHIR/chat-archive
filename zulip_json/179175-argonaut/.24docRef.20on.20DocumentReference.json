I note that it isn't part of the FHIR  base profile for DocumentReference and based on my reading of <a href=\"http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/StructureDefinition-argo-documentreference.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/StructureDefinition-argo-documentreference.html\">http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/StructureDefinition-argo-documentreference.html</a> it is intended as a not-very-simplified way to execute a query with a CCD type specifier. I don't see how this adds any real value.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Reading further (<a href=\"http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/OperationDefinition-docref.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/OperationDefinition-docref.html\">http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/OperationDefinition-docref.html</a>) I find this qualification: \"The server SHOULD return at least all references for documents that it has made available in a document indexing system. This is the same as a simple query (GET [base]/DocumentReference?patient=[id]). This operaton differs from a simple query in that DocumentReferences may be created ‘on-the-fly’ in response to this operation.”</p>\n<p>So $docRef exists to support the on-demand use case only?</p>",
