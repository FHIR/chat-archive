It seems US-core Encounter profile does not have the diagnosis.condition included. Any specific reason for the not to include condition ? is there a plan to include it ? can we go ahead and create extension on it for our use case or is there a way to include conditions with respect to Encounter?</p>\n<p>Any help and guidance is much appreciated !!</p>",
