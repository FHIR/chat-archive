Thanks, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191912\">@Michele Mottini</span> for doing this (and ONC and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> for supporting it).  Basically, I would say that I agree with your list, Grahame.  For some of the differences I think there are simple explanations and possibly good reasons for them.  For some others, the differences probably arose due to the timing and coming at it from different places.  And at least many terminology differences will be expected based on a US vs. international specification.  One thing in the review that I didn't see Grahame note is the difference between the document based structure of IPS and the querying of individual profiled resources in Argonaut.  In IPS we are already working to move in the direction of enabling and encouraging the use of the individual profiles (either in the soon to be published initial version or the next version) to cover a broader set of use cases.</p>\n<p>With that said, I think I would agree that Grahame's last three bullets are probably the most significant ones to look at (and hopefully harmonize) further.  My quick take on those is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I think the reason IPS landed on Observation rather than DR is that we moved from CDA which uses observations and that was a natural correspondence - but I don't think that necessarily constitutes a valid reason for IPS to perpetuate this difference, so we should further consider this.</li>\n<li>The clinical notes discussion was re-energized and has gotten recent attention mostly after we had already established the pattern in IPS and the work in both streams occurred in parallel, so we haven't really looked at this difference until now (and I don't recall getting any ballot comments in regard to it specifically).  It seems to me like we should be able to come together here.</li>\n<li>I think the use of observation vs. document reference is related to the clinical notes issue above, and just hasn't really been considered so far.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It seems to me that there's probably some alignment work to be considered on both sides, but certainly the weight of existing implementations on the Argonaut side is a very significant consideration.  But however we need to do it, I think we should try to align both specs to the extent that is possible.</p>",

I can't see a way to do something like that without going to ballot, and we didn't submit a NIB for May (although we gave some consideration to the possibility).
