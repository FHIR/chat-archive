My institution is doing some foundational work with the WHO in mapping their clinical guidelines to standard terminologies and FHIR to enable computable guidelines.  We are in the midst of some early pilot demonstration work with them, and we have decided to start from either the IPS or USCDI as an intermediate EHR patient object representation.  As it relates to USCDI/Argonaut, we found it difficult to figure out where we'd graft in pregnancy history.  Any immediate thoughts come to mind?  Happy to give more context if necessary.</p>",
