My first thought was that the attachment in DiagnosticReport has to be also included in one of the 5 required DocumentReference. But when I though more about it, I am trending to think that any DocumentReference with category=clinical-note should be included. On top of that, since the guidance does not say that DocumentReference SHALL has category=clinical-note and the terminology binding is extensible, that means I cannot exclude any DocumentReference in theory.</p>",
