Is there anything that says that they are not conformant by only searching within the <code>family</code> field, as was the case with this server?  I didn't see anything in the <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/general-guidance.html#search-syntax\">US Core Search</a> section, and this definition seems to come from base FHIR, so it seems unlikely there would be stronger language in the base spec.</p>",
