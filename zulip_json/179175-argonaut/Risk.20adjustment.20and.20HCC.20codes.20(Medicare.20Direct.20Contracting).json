For that we are using the MeasureReport Resource and the code under Group is where we represent the HCC code.

Since it is a Hierarchical Condition Code, I can see the logic to representing it as a Condition but there is not a code system for them yet.  We are discussing that.

Very helpful. You are correct; I am less interested in the coding gap report going from payer to provider, and am more interested in how we should be documenting HCC's for the purpose of direct contracting with CMS. Especially interesting to me is that documentation needs to be updated annually for the risk adjustment payments to continue. </p>\n<p>I am definitely interested and will start hopping onto your calls to learn more.</p>",
