I'm wondering if anyone who's actively done work in this space already (e.g., to build a qualified CDSM) might be willing to give an overview of the rules/process in this Friday's call. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192631\">@Alex Tatiyants</span> is it possible someone at Stanson might? Or, other ideas?</p>",
