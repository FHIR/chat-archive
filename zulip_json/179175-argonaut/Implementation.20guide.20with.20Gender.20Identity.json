I'd like to point out there is regulatory guidance from ONC on expectations for recording gender identity and sexual orientation. I'm not thrilled with this guidance but it does exist in <a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/test-method/demographics\">the sections for Paragraphs (a)(5)(i)(D) and (E)</a> in the test method certification guide. I'll note that many in the community working on the gender harmony ballot hope to see this improve once the work is completed.</p>",
