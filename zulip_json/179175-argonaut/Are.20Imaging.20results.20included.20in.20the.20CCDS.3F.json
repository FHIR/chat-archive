However there isn't any language in US Core about imaging results that I could see.  The profiled DiagnosticReport clearly calls out that it is for lab only.  If we were to include Imaging results in the Procedure resource, the actual result would presumably be in Procedure.report, which points to the non-profiled DiagnosticReport.</p>\n<p>So I guess I'm looking for two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does US-Core / Argonaut consider Imaging results to be part of the CCDS?</li>\n<li>If so, how should they be represented in FHIR?</li>\n</ul>",

We explained that a diagnostic image report contains a consulting\n specialist&#39;s interpretation of image data, that it is intended to convey the\n interpretation to the referring (ordering) physician, and that it becomes part\n of the patient&#39;s medical record.\nComments. Commenters were generally supportive of including diagnostic\n image reports and associated context in the “VDT” criterion. Some commenters\nrequested clarification on where this data would be accessible within the C-CDA.\nResponse. We have adopted this proposal to include the diagnostic imaging\nreport (including the consulting specialist&#39;s interpretation) as a requirement\nin the “VDT” criterion. Health IT Modules may include this information in the\n“Results” section of the CCD. We clarify that unstructured data for the\ninterpretation text is acceptable.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Then later:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>We proposed a new 2015 Edition criterion at §?170.315(g)(7) that would require\n health IT to demonstrate it could provide application access to the\nCommon Clinical Data Set via an application programming interface (API),\nand requiring that those same capabilities be met as part of the “VDT” criterion\n</pre></div>",
