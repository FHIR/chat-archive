However...</p>\n<p>That said, Coverage doesn't have many of the \"hard\" elements that make update really challenging (like Address).  The only properties with tricky data types when doing an update interaction (CodeableConcept) are type and relationship.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Type is hard, because a reg system will never just update a coverage with new type.  We'd error and ask for a new coverage.  But because we'd error, maybe an update is fine, and if a type change is provided we'd just send back an OO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Relationship is probably something we'd be willing to let a client update.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So at the end, I think I'm in favor of update.</p>\n</blockquote>",
