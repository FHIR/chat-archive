There is no code for the Grouping of chiropractic - \"Chiropractic Providers\" but as Eric has figured out, they use a consistent start to all the codes in a group, 11xx for Chiropractic. Sometime (true for Chiropractic) there is consistency across the first 4 characters in a Group (111N here) but for other Groupings only the first two characters are the same and the other two increment across what I assume are considered sub-Groupings (or they just need more numbers - hence the value of \"meaningless Ids.)  Of note, they have multiple \"codes\" with the same \"specialization\" description - ie: there are more than one \"neurology\" code.

Basically  the code system, as published, is a PITA due to poor descriptions and complicated meaningful identifiers.  Now this code system is defined by the NUCC but is maintained and distributed (for free!) by the AMA. Here is the real question - can we \"enhance\" the content of the code system within our use so that we determine a code for the Grouping phrase (say \"10\" for \"Behavioral Health &amp; Social Service Providers\" and so on) and can we also provide a second description that packs together all the pieces into a single fully specific \"full\" description? We could add the full description using a \"code system supplement\" if we wanted to do this correctly. But to add a code for the Grouping we'd need to either declare this a new FHIR code system, pretend we owned it and simply add the codes, potentially as a code system fragment. Or we can find the person responsible and see if they will fix things. I tried that in the distant past and didn't get far.</p>",
