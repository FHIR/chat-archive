        "content": "<p>We have been looking at Encounters especially as they relate to ADT's.  The US Core Profile for Encounter, requires the element, type.  Currently Encounter.type is bound extensibly to the CPT E&amp;M codes.  However, E&amp;M Codes represent the interaction between a practitioner/provider and a patient not a facility and a patient like ADT's do.  We know that we can add code sets there but would like to\" fly in formation\"/harmonize and take the same approach that other vendors/institutions are in this area.  What code sets/values are you using for encounter.type between the facility and the patient?  Do you think this should be a recommendation to formalize in US Core? ThanQ in advance for the insight!</p>",
