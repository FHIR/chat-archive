One thing we're worried about is the mismatch between politically-defined groups and biologically-defined groups.  In our case, we're currently working on mammography and breast-cancer risk analysis; and the racial differences in incidences of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.  </p>\n<p>Caucasians, African-Americans, and Ashkenazi Jews are all known to have different mutation rates; yet to just say 'White, Black, Other' as the CDC Race and Ethnicity Code Set specifies has all sorts of problems....  Western Europeans have different rates than Eastern, so 'White' is an erroneous category; African seems straightforward until you get into North Africa; and Ashkenazi Jew isn't even tracked, and could be recorded as either Middle Eastern, African, or Eastern European, or just statistically lost in 'Other'.  It's a mess.  And the CDC Code Set arguably contributes to the problem.  </p>\n<p>I'm tentatively gravitating towards the stance that there's a professional responsibility to use a granular allele-based encoding of some sort (although I'm not clear yet what that would be), and a legal responsibility to report via CDC Race code or OMB five codes, and to do a mapping between the two.   So, perhaps another reason to have multiple extensions with which to encode race is if you're working with genomic data and tracking allele groups?    </p>",

I'm not sure CMS has defined what conformance they require. As you know C-CDA made some changes to allow that multiple DETAILED race concepts can be exchanged and I thought we had made a change to allow the same for Ethnicity (so more than one sub-type of a \"hispanic heritage\" could be captured.
