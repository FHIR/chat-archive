Within our source data, there are many records associated with LOINC panel codes however, the results tend to be reported in a single row not associated with the child LOINC codes that build the panel.  In this scenario, Can we build the profile with only the LOINC panel code information without having the result (see example below). <br>\n24321-2 - Basic metabolic 2000 panel - Serum or Plasma</p>",
