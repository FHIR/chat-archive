That stream aims to facilitate the growth of a global IPS (International Patient Summary) community of practice by sharing, exploring, and developing ideas around the IPS.<br>\nIn this sense it should be open to any discussion and idea about (1) the IPS ecosystems, including the IPS CDA implementers, the CEN EN 17269 standard (the reference IPS dataset), or the future ISO IPS standard and IHE IPS profile;  (2) the IPS implementations (3) correlation of the IPS with other initiatives (e.g. argonaut).<br>\nI hope that all the interested people could join that stream and contribute to the IPS community.<br>\nThanks, Giorgio</p>",
