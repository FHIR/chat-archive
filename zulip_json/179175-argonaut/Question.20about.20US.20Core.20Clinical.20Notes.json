        "content": "<p>On the US Core Diagnostic Report and Note page (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-diagnosticreport-note.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-diagnosticreport-note.html</a>) is a link and description of the Diagnostic Report Category (extensible).  A similar concept with different categories is also on the Laboratory variant of DiagnosticReport.  If I select to look at the list of category codes , a new page opens <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/ValueSet-us-core-diagnosticreport-category.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/ValueSet-us-core-diagnosticreport-category.html</a>.  On this page are three codes identified as LOINC Code   Display<br>\nLP29684-5   Radiology<br>\nLP29708-2   Cardiology<br>\nLP7839-6    Pathology<br>\nIf I click on the link for each code, I get a loinc error page indicating that the link is bad.  If I search in LOINC for these codes, I also am unable to find them.  So at the very least, the US Core FHir page should be corrected to have working links.  I am looking at the latest version.  At a different level, it is not clear at all whether the category should be just that- a category that could include many different types of Radiology, Cardiology, and Pathology reports or if it has some other meaning.  In main FHIR this maps to a Diagnostic Service Section which is an easily relatable concept.  I am guessing that the US Core didn't want the local codes that are allowed in the Diagnostic Service Section list so instead they imposed a rule that everything has to be categorized in one of these three codes.  So- two questions:  Can the links be fixed so that the codes  can be seen in LOINC ?  Can there be a better description in US Core to make it clear that multiple Diagnostic Service Sections codes can and should be mapping to the three examples presented - for example the HL7 table 0074 Diagnostic Service section code for CT could map to this LP29682-5 Radiology code?  note that the US core document cites Loinc 2.68 but Loinc is now at 2.69.</p>",
