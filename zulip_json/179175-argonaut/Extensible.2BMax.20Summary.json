The case of CareTeam the rational is not known.   If there made extensible then they are not strictly in line with the regulations, but cause pain for implementers dealing with real world data.  If they are made extensible then there is no way to validate regulatory compliance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/argonautproject/R4/wiki/Max-Binding-Summary\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/argonautproject/R4/wiki/Max-Binding-Summary\">https://github.com/argonautproject/R4/wiki/Max-Binding-Summary</a></p>",
