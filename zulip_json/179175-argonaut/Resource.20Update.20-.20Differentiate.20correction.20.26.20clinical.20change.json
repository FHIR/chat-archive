For example if I first receive a Condition resource with clinicalStatus = active, fetch the resource from the server again a month later and get an updated resource with clinicalStatus = remission. How can I determine if the patientâ€™s condition status has changed within the last month or if clinicalStatus = active a month ago was an error and the condition should be considered as in remission at that time already?</p>",
