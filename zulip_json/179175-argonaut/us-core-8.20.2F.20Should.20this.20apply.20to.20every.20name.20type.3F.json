Is the intent for this invariant to apply to all <a href=\"http://Patient.name\">Patient.name</a> entries, or at least one?  In our case, we use Patient.name.text for old names and aliases, and we don't always have discrete components, so we aren't sending given/family.  Now we could add a DAR here, but wondering if the intent was that <em>at least</em> one entry in <a href=\"http://Patient.name\">Patient.name</a> have (given or family) OR DAR, or that <em>all</em> name entries have it.  It seems a little strange to require a DAR for name types with a use of nickname, anonymous and (arguably) old.</p>",
