The Observation Results Profile has a slicing structure on the <code>value[x]</code> that adds complexity especially when basing other profiles on this profile (see <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/profiling.html#reslicing\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/profiling.html#reslicing\">'reslicing'</a>).  We are proposing remove the slicing structure so that the profile will pose less of a barrier to implementation.
