I am comfortable with required bindings as it provides a quality product.  In the CARIN IG, bindings are defined as required in order to conform to external code systems.  Additionally, the CARIN IG is based on claims submission standards adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services.  However, in the R4 EOB, there is a situation where if item is populated, then .productOrService must be populated.  For Inpatient Institutional claims, .revenue is required.  However, for the majority of the claims, .productOrService is not available and so we needed to add the Not Available code to the .productOrService value set so payers could provide accurate data.  A ticket has been submitted relaxing the requirement in R5.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191430\">@Paul Knapp</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191884\">@MaryKay McDaniel</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192132\">@Amol Vyas</span></p>",

Loosing the 1..1 cardinality constraint on BOTH practitioner and organization is needed.   Plan-Net requires that one of practitioner, organization, location, or healthcareservice be defined for each instance.<br>\n  2) There are two value set issues that I'm hoping can also be addressed.

The provider role, aka type, is used in provider contracting/credentialing for provider networks, e.g. physician, social worker, advanced practice nurse.  The NUCC Health Care Taxonomy code set is provider specialty not provider role. In order for a practitioner to have a specialty within the physician section of the code set, the practitioner must first be defined as a physician. While the code values in the value set may be different from what payers use within their systems, the concepts are the same and can easily be mapped. For example, Plan-net has 'ph' for physician while our underlying database has 'A1' for M.D. and 'A6' for D.O.. One value in Plan-net is sufficient as the actual license degree is sent in qualifications. <br>\nHope this helps.</p>",
