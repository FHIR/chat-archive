If that one category has to be a lab,  would it stand to reason that US core does not support any other Codes within <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-diagnostic-service-sections.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-diagnostic-service-sections.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-diagnostic-service-sections.html</a>.   I am working with Data that has Radiology (RAD) as an example. <br>\nThanks,<br>\nJoyce</p>",
