LOINC and RxNorm are also found in VSAC but they are already included as code systems.    Clinical and payer systems would be ICD-10 and CPT/HCPCS since 10/2015 (but still have  pertinent ICD-9  data from before that).    The spec should include code system and code value for a resource similar to how CQL manages VSAC oids.  <br>\nClinical systems  must deal with patient information going back in time.    Cross-mapping between coding systems is extremely difficult and usually gets dropped on the shoulders of clinicians.   If code system and value are passed, then comparing to data sets such as the VSAC oids are the way to go for CQM, CDS, etc.<br>\nps  my personal favorite for ICD-10 was      V97.33XD: Sucked into jet engine, subsequent encounter.</p>",
