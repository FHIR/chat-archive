We might assert that our 'signed' equals 'legally authenticated,' but then we have a problem with 'co-signed,' and others. </p>\n<p>I think we need new values. The value sets (for activity and for agent.role) are extensible, so we can do that. But the obvious source systems (V3, SCT) don't seem to have what we want.</p>\n<p>What are others doing about this?</p>",
