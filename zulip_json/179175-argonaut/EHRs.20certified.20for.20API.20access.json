Athena supports DSTU2, but only the OAuth2 client credentials flow. eCW and McKesson supports <em>STU3</em> and SMART. MEDITECH supports DSTU2 and OAuth (not SMART).</p>\n<p><strong>Analysis</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As Michele suggests, a large number of certified systems are using existing proprietary APIs to meet regulation. likely these APIs are the shortest path to meeting regulation. If supporting FHIR, developers aren’t sure which version to support. Where FHIR is used, DSTU2 is the primary version, followed by STU3.</li>\n<li>FHIR is more prevalent than SMART, although the dominant auth standard is OAuth (there’s not SAML at all!). Why aren’t developers using SMART?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Common Clinical Data Set of FHIR resources should be normative to standardize patient API access and provide a straightforward path to API (and therefore app) developers.</li>\n<li>Likely the existing OAuth2 libraries don’t support SMART, so neither do developers. HL7 SMART should perform outreach to API developers to assist.</li>\n</ul>",
