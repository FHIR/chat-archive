Pharmacy has discussed very recently constraining the type in US-Core from its current definition of  *resource(Any)* (can't find  active tracker). And the list below aligns pretty much with what they are thinking.  Unfortunately they were unable resolve prior to STU3 deadline.   However, I think we should go ahead and constrain the type in US-Core from *resource(Any)*  to reference only:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MedicationRequest</li>\n<li>MedicationDispense</li>\n<li>Claim</li>\n<li>Observation</li>\n<li>QuestionnaireResponse</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(What about Compositions or Binaries or DocumentReference for other sources?)</p>",
