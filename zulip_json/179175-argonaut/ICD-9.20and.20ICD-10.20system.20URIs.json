It is true that both the diagnoses and procedures are included in ICD-9-CM, but ICD-10-CM does not include procedures - they are coded separately in ICD-10-PCS.  From a general (not FHIR) standpoint it's explained pretty well <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm_pcs_background.htm\" title=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm_pcs_background.htm\">here</a>, I think.  From the FHIR perspective, I see two Zulip topic threads that we've had on this <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/ICD-10.20URIs\" title=\"#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/ICD-10.20URIs\">here</a> and <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179202-terminology/topic/ICD-10-PCS\" title=\"#narrow/stream/179202-terminology/topic/ICD-10-PCS\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>It seems that we haven't actually finished settling the ICD-10-PCS code system url issue.  In the second Zulip thread there seemed to be support for using <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-pcs\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-pcs\">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-pcs</a>.

As I mentioned in the Zulip thread, I don't think that's a good (correct) choice, as that is a url for a particular commercial service which is definitely not the code system owner or an officially authoritative source.  So do we need to get together (US Core, Vocab WG, HTA) and take another look at this (and hopefully finish it)? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191401\">@Eric Haas</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191410\">@Brett Marquard</span></p>",
