Was that reference to birth certificate intentional?    We (Epic SOGI experts) view birth sex as an approximation of likely physiological structures (i.e. it is a biological summary finding, not a legal one).</p>\n<p>In the base Patient resources, we're adding some <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/patient.html#gender\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/patient.html#gender\">language around sex and gender</a>.   When I initially drafted that, I based my SAAB definition on the US Core definition of birth sex.  However upon review with our SOGI experts, they wanted me to omit the reference to birth registration, and make SAAB more of a \"clinical summary finding\".  However if I do that, then the definitions in R4 Patient will differ from US Core and LOINC.  Does anyone object to that difference?</p>",

So there isn't just one \"legal sex\", there are potentially a ton that can vary by realm.  And each legal sex value would need to be qualified by the legal document type.  For example, you could have a birth certificate in one state that is \"male\", and a drivers license in another state that is \"female\" and a taxpayer registration in another state that is \"X\".  And since birth certificates are state specific, there isn't a single value set for birth certificate \"sex\", but rather each state specifies what that state allows for the birth certificate.  And they are all starting to be different. :/</p>\n<p>That's why I was trying to make my proposed language separate clinical and legal.  The initial (usually visual) clinical observation is used as the basis for the \"initial\" legal sex (i.e. the one on the first government-issued legal document, the birth certificate).    While I'm not sure if it is probably that an intersex/non-deterinate sex is often recorded as the initial clinical sex assigned at birth, if it were, and the state did not allow that on the birth certificate, the SAAB and the sex on the birth certificate could differ.</p>\n<p>All that said, I'm not sure I'm all that passionate for untangling this immediately, as I think everyone is just going to have to be somewhat flexible in the sex/gender domain anyway.</p>",
