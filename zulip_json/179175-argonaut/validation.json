I have a working branch of the validator that loosens the strictness of the profile parsing in order to work around this, but I am wondering if I've missed something fundamental before proposing changes to the validator itself. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span></p>",
