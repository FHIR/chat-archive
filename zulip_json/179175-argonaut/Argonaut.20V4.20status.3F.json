The decision from those above me is to \"go with International V4\" which is a bit loose at the macro component level.  So my basic question is how mature argonaut for V4 is (i.e. how not subject to change it is) &amp; how comprehensive. i.e. we do not want to be creating our own macro-datastructures if we can avoid it as that clashes with the standard &amp; interoperable aims.  At the moment we are specifically restricting ourselves to \"GET\" with POST to follow once we have get done.</p>",
