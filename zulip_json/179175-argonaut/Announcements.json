Ideally, we will resolve all prior to ballot, but I am sure a few new ones will come up :)</p>\n<p>A few priorities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Must Support flagging at sub-element/references</li>\n<li>Rework of Vital Signs to clarify inheritance from base FHIR core</li>\n<li>Responding to US Core 'variance' requests - these are requests from other active US projects to update US Core to better support reuse of profiles. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The CGP meets Thursdays from 1-2 PM Eastern. The next call is 10/22/2020 where we plan to review <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/issues/?filter=13416\">Block Vote 1</a> which I will formally post to listserv later today. Additional calls may be scheduled.
