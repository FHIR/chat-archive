I'm curious whether the issues that we (Saul + <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"231038\">@Gail Kocher</span> ) have raised with the value set bindings for PractitionerRole.code and specialty are queued up for discussion?   The proposal is for USCore to use a superset of the VSs defined for these fields in Plan-Net (so that Plan-Net could profile USCore).</p>\n<p>As <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"231038\">@Gail Kocher</span> has pointed out, the VS for code (currently using NUCC Provider Taxonomy) is inappropriate, and the VS for specialty is overly broad (which doesn't bother Plan-Net, which uses a NUCC Provider Taxonomy subset). </p>\n<p>I couldn't find one, but if I need to create a tracker, I'm happy to do it.</p>\n<p>Thx,  Saul</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"215603\">@Sean Mahoney</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192607\">@Robert Dieterle</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"222957\">@Dave Hill</span></p>",

Of the remaining three two are too broadly defined in the code system for how the terms are used within US healthcare, i.e. doctor and nurse. A doctor is not \"a qualified/registered medical professional\". Examples such as a social worker or physician assistant are qualified/registered medical professionals but within the US, their licensure would prevent using the term 'doctor' to describe their role. </p>\n<p>I suspect you reviewed and rejected SNOMED. How did you decide to reject SNOMED?<br>\nThe SNOMED list is a conglomeration of provider types and provider specialties and care team roles. Care team roles are not what health plans contract/credential providers for, rather they are credentialed for the type of provider and then for specific specialty(ies). The specialty is conveyed in PractitionerRole.specialty not PractitionerRole.code. </p>\n<p>Therefore we developed a value set of provider types, aka roles only.</p>",
