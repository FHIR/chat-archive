(And given where else it's used, we don't necessarily want to redefine the extension, it may be necessary to use a new extension.)</p>\n<p>The max extension creates an overall maximum binding that implementers <em>must</em> adhere to (text by itself is not an option).  It is used, for example, for language codes where the overall maximum is the IETF code lists that's pretty much unlimited (because it's algorithmicly defined).  Implementers are however restricted to that list.  They can't send just text or their own local codes.  The regular binding is to a much more limited set of codes that makes for a reasonable drop-down list.  Essentially we're saying that \"if you want to extend your dropdown list, you must pick codes from IETF and nothing else\".</p>\n<p>That's <em>not</em> the behavior Argonaut wants.  Therefore, you can't use the extension.  What I <em>think</em> you want to say is \"Pick from this list of codes if you can.  If not, you must send text.\"  What I'm not clear on is whether you're allowed to send local codes in addition to text.  (Personally, I think prohibiting local/non-standard codes is a bad idea as it prevents the re-use of the interface where sending alternate codes would be beneficial.)  In either case, you could enforce what you want with an invariant on the CodeableConcept.  Something like \"(coding in 'your valueset canonical URL here').exists()) or text.exists()\"</p>",
