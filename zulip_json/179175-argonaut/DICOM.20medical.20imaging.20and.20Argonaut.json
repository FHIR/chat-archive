To what extent has Argonaut been looking at exposing medical imaging via ImagingStudy and the associated DICOM / DICOMweb mechanisms? It's a simple-sounding question with likely a mountain of architectural discussion - but I'm curious to what extent this has been explored. <br>\n(cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191380\">@Elliot Silver</span> )</p>",

Although the subject has been broached on several occasions we haven't come to a consensus on what to support for imaging.

If there is a use case that could change the prioritization, I'd be interested in hearing it.
