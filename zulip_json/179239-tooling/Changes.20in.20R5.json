        "content": "<p>In the next week, I'll be releasing the first milestone release on the march to R5. This one will be 4.2, and it will be the base of the Connectathon in Sydney. </p>\n<p>Reference Implementation Maintainers will be under pressure to update and generate for 4.2. Note that 4.2 will be toast after the connectathon; it doesn't have any life expectancy. But if you are someone who uses StructureDefinitions to generate implementation collateral, this note is for you (e.g. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191367\">@Brian Postlethwaite</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191318\">@nicola (RIO/SS)</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196561\">@Nick George</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191319\">@James Agnew</span>)</p>\n<p>The abstract types underlying the actual implementation types and resources have changed quite a bit in the lead up to this release, and while that has no impact on implementers generally, it <em>will</em> break the existing code gneerators etc. The quick summary is that the current R5 draft normalises some of the magic underlying the type system, and you'll have to undo some special magic (or re-work it).</p>\n<p>The relevant changes are all found on 2 different pages: <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/types.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/types.html\">http://build.fhir.org/types.html</a> and <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/uml.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/uml.html\">http://build.fhir.org/uml.html</a>. Please review and ask any questions sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>James, I'll be re-generating the R5 classes, when I cut 4.2. The main change to the generated R5 classes is that the class currently named \"MetadataResource\" will be renamed to \"CanonicalResource\"</p>",
