The page is here: <a href=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Tooling_Eco-system\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Tooling_Eco-system\">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Tooling_Eco-system</a></p>\n<p>The content there is not complete.  We're probably missing tooling areas and we're definitely missing some of the tooling implementations.  As well, the notions about architecture are a straw model for discussion - we need agreement from the community that this is what we want to do and how we want to do it.  So if you're involved in creating tooling or interested in using tooling that supports FHIR development, please review and provide feedback.  Discussion will happen here and potentially on some FHIR-I calls.  If there's sufficient volume of feedback, we may schedule some tooling-specific calls.</p>",
