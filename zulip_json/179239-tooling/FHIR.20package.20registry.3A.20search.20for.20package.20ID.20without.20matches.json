Thus, if I <a href=\"https://registry.fhir.org/results?query=%22smart4health.eu.core%22&amp;latestFilter=true\">search for \"smart4health.eu.core\"</a>, I get zero matches (though <a href=\"https://registry.fhir.org/package/smart4health.eu.core%7C0.1.1\">the package with that ID is listed</a>). On the other hand, a <a href=\"https://registry.fhir.org/results?query=%22hl7.fhir.uv.ips%22&amp;latestFilter=true\">search for the IPS package ID \"hl7.fhir.uv.ips\"</a> <em>does</em> give a match. Searching on related terms (e.g. just \"smart4health\") works, but it might be confusing if the exact ID is not recognized. Is there some way to tweak the indexing to make this always work?</p>",
