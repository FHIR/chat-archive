Try setting that to the desired FHIR version with <code>fhir spec R3</code> etc.</li>\n<li>With <code>fhir scope</code> you can see what packages are currently installed in the scope. You can also see in the package.json file in a folder what packages are set as dependencies for this scope, restore them (install them) with <code>fhir restore</code> and in fhirpkg.lock.json you can see the results of that. Try not to mix different FHIR versions in one folder.</li>\n<li><code>fhir cache</code> shows all packages installed in your global FHIR package cache (or find them on disk: <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Package+Cache\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Package+Cache</a>). You can safely delete them since they will be re-downloaded. But in this case, I don't expect the issue to be there.</li>\n<li>With <code>fhir stack</code> you can see what you currently have on the stack, to make sure it's the resource you expect.</li>\n</ul>",
