        "content": "<p>Hi Michel,<br>\nJust downloaded forge for R4. Trying to create a complex extension and finding it to be different from the DSTU2 version I've used before. Is there  updated documentation on extension creation using R4? <br>\n I'm trying to extend the patient resource with an extension containing 'code'(codeableConcept) and 'date' (dateTime). The values don't show up with their respective datatypes as they used to in dstu2- valueCodeableConcept and valueDateTime. And also, the values show up as slices in R4.<br>\nThanks!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196228\">@Priya Mathew</span>, FHIR R4 introduces new rules for type slicing. The Forge R4 user interface has been changed to reflect these changes. This is most noticeable when you constrain a extension.value[x] element. Please note that type slicing in the initial Forge R4 releases is still experimental and not yet 100% correct. We've had a relevant discussion with the FHIR core team during DevDays US in Redmond that will allow us to stabilize and finalize this feature. I'm planning on improving this in the next update, to be released in a couple of weeks.</p>",
