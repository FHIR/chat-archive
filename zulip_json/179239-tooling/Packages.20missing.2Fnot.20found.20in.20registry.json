The most recent listed version is 0.2.2. However, in the registry I can only find versions. <a href=\"https://registry.fhir.org/package/smart4health.eu.core%7C0.1.0\">0.1.0</a> and <a href=\"https://registry.fhir.org/package/smart4health.eu.core%7C0.1.1\">0.1.1</a>, although 0.2.2. was released 28 days ago.</li>\n<li>I seem to be unable to find any version of this package using the registry search. E.g. it is not on the hit list for any of the search terms \"Smart4Health\", \"Smart\",  \"<a href=\"http://smart4health.eu\">smart4health.eu</a>\" , and \"artefacts\", despite the package description being\"FHIR artefacts for the Smart4Health project (<a href=\"https://smart4health.eu/\">https://smart4health.eu/</a>).\")</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Has there been a problem with the registration of these package versions?</p>",

You'll see your search queries do return (the two older versions of) the right package when you uncheck <code>Latest releases only</code>: <a href=\"https://registry.fhir.org/results?query=%22artefacts%22\">https://registry.fhir.org/results?query=%22artefacts%22</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Working on having both fixed as soon as possible.

        "content": "<p>Thanks <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"203235\">@Ward Weistra</span>, sounds good. Actually, the latest tag is also a little tricky for this package since by semantic versioning (but not by date), the latest is an unlistet package version that was accidentally assigned an entirely wrong version (mix-up with other package...). Will the registry by default ignore unlisted packages (would be my expectation as a user) and show the latest <em>listed</em>  package if the package with the highest semver is unlisted?</p>\n<p>(I realize this all sonds as if I had been trying to deliberately construct a weird corner case, but I can assure you  it was not on purpose  <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span> )</p>",
