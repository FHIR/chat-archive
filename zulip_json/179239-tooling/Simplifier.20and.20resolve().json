        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191451\">@Patrick Werner</span>, we've just discussed with the Firely .NET SDK team that they are likely going to move this to the FHIR version agnostic (so not STU3/R4/R5 specific part of the library). Once that is done it will be easier for us to add to <a href=\"http://Simplifier.net\">Simplifier.net</a>. We've created a temporary workaround for <code>hasValue()</code>, but for <code>resolve()</code> this was too difficult.<br>\nSorry for the trouble, but we're working on it. Do you have a ticket in the <a href=\"https://firely.atlassian.net/servicedesk\">support  desk</a>? Then we're sure you will be notified once implemented.</p>",
