        "content": "<p><a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">http://tx.fhir.org</a> is the default terminology service for FHIR tools - specially the validator and the IG publisher. It's never been our intent that <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a> be the only terminology service in town, and there's a set of other services that would like to make their content available within the FHIR eco-system - that is, to the FHIR tooling. </p>\n<p>Tooling in this case includes: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>the FHIR validator and IG publisher</li>\n<li>Sushi</li>\n<li>Simplifier</li>\n<li>any other design time tooling</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've long had an action item to do something about this. So today, I've started on that. Here's a draft of a page that describes the process of making a terminology service available to the FHIR community through the tools: <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Publishing+terminology+to+the+FHIR+Ecosystem\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Publishing+terminology+to+the+FHIR+Ecosystem</a></p>\n<p>I know that at least the HL7 Australia would like to make the Australian NCTS available this way, and I will be making VSAC available this way, and probably art-decor. </p>\n<p>Comments are welcome and sought from toolsmiths, terminology service provides, and other interested business parties. Note: obviously this process is extremely draft; I expect it to firm up as we discuss. I will direct all discussion to here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191343\">@Michael Lawley</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191375\">@Alexander Henket</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191942\">@Matt Rahn</span></p>",
