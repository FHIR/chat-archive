I am aiming to add Observations (flowsheet entries) to Patient records in epic using a \"backend\" service client registration. We currently have no natural open Encounter to reference in that Observation.</p>\n<p>Is there a programatic way to open an Encounter in Epic? Alternatively, can I enter Observations (flowsheets) without an open Encounter? [My understanding here is \"no\" and \"no\", but I am hoping I have overlooked something.]</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hi all, figured I would also share this question with this group given I haven't heard back from <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179166\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers\">#implementers</a>.  Would appreciate your thoughts!</p>",
