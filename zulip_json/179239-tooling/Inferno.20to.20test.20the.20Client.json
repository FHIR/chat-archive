One option would be to host a FHIR server (or proxy to a server), and then observe the client performing everything that is required of it... perhaps by telling it to follow a thoughtfully crafted script that mimics real use cases, or maybe something more open ended like \"show me at least one example of every interaction listed in this CapabilityStatement... e.g. read/search/create for resources types X, Y and Z\".  But depending on the context, it may require a user to drive the client... therefore time consuming compared to server testing.</p>",
