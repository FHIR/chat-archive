I hear there has been conversation before about creating these in a shared format. Do you think that would be doable for (part of) these rules, eg. express them in FHIR Path statements we could share between tooling?</p>",

The IG publisher always allows references to <a href=\"http://example.org\">example.org</a> and <a href=\"http://acme.com\">acme.com</a>. You can register additional example domains if you want. It's an error if Value set and profile references in profiles don't resolve. It's not an error if code system canonicals in value sets don't resolve - but it does create a warning. Except that it might be an error in some uses. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Duplicate canonicals within project or full scope</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That would create errors for the IG publisher, unless.. there might be a way to pull this off.
