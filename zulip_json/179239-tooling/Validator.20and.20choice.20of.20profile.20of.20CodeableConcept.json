In my profile Organization.type has a choice of for-testing-only profiles of CodeableConcept. The qa report incorrectly says for all examples that Organization.type matches multiple choices. In organization-example0, it should have no problems, the other examples should produce errors as they do match any of the choices.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/ci-collaborative/au-fhir-base-r4/tree/feature/SRAIG-61-au-base-organisation-quality-review-and-update\">branch in GitHub</a></p>",
