So far, only german (de) translations have been provided. If you want to provide translations to a different language, you need to create and maintain a sibling to this file: <a href=\"https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/blob/master/org.hl7.fhir.utilities/src/main/resources/Messages_de.properties\">https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/blob/master/org.hl7.fhir.utilities/src/main/resources/Messages_de.properties</a>, which is a language variant to the master file <a href=\"https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/blob/master/org.hl7.fhir.utilities/src/main/resources/Messages.properties\">https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/blob/master/org.hl7.fhir.utilities/src/main/resources/Messages.properties</a>. I only ever add things to the end of the master file - even if I revise an existing message, I move it to the end of the file, to make it easy for maintainers. </p>\n<p>Translations for other languages are most welcome. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191364\">@Peter Jordan</span>  can you please pass this on to the intl co-chairs, so they can see if someone wants to take this task on on behalf of the affiliate?
