We would love to chat with you!</p>\n<p>My name is Alfredo and I work at the Tooling team here at Commure (<a href=\"https://developer.commure.com\">https://developer.commure.com</a>). Commure is building a FHIR-native open Platform for healthcare developers, and we’d love your expert opinion about what it is you actually need to make better FHIR-native software. </p>\n<p>This would be a super casual 30 min chat at any time that works for you during the next couple of weeks. We are a young startup so regretfully can’t offer any gift cards, but will send you the softest t-shirt on Earth and a pretty awesome face mask :) </p>\n<p>If you are interested in participating just sign up here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://calendly.com/commure-tooling-team/user-interview\">https://calendly.com/commure-tooling-team/user-interview</a></p>\n<p>or DM me!</p>",
