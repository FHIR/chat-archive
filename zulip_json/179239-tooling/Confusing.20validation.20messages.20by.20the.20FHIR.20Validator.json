The CodeSystem is included in the ig, but it is marked as empty with <code>status</code>=<em>unknown</em> and <code>content</code>=<em>not-present</em> as we don't have the content (we still include it to provide background information to implementers). The ValueSet is included in the ig as well, also without explicit concepts (it simply includes said CodeSystem).</p>\n<p>When I run the validator on my instance, I get the following two messages.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>  Information @ Flag.code.coding[0] (line 21, col17) : Code System URI &#39;urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.4.1.902.40&#39; is unknown so the code cannot be validated\n  Warning @ Flag.code (line 20, col11) : [Unable to determine whether the provided codes are in the value set http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.9.14.1--20200901000000 because the value set or code system is not known to the validator]\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>These messages seem to be a bit misleading. The first message suggests that the code system is not known altogether, but I would expect it to say that there is insufficient information to validate the code in the CodeSystem. The second message is an extension of this; both the CodeSystem and the ValueSet are in fact known, they just don't contain the information needed for proper validation.</p>\n<p>Could these messages be changed?</p>",
