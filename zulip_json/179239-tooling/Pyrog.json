I'll try and install once more. Are the installation instructions (<a href=\"https://github.com/arkhn/pyrog\">https://github.com/arkhn/pyrog</a>) up to date?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"306822\">@Sven Helfer</span> ,<br>\nThe instructions are not perfectly up to date, but you shouldn't have too much troubles installing the tool ;)<br>\nNote that Pyrog is only used to explore an unknown database and to generate mapping rules.  These mapping rules are further used by our ETL tool to integrate the standardized data into a FHIR server. These latter tools are also on our github, but their orchestration requires some work.</p>",
