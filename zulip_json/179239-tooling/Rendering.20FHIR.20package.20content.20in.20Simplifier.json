I am working on an IG that re-uses certain element of the IPS directly and would like to render the corresponding profiles in my IG. I know that one can render elements of other Simplifier projects using the <code>{{tree:ProjectName/ResourceName}}</code> syntax. However, it seems IPS is not available as a Simplifier project. It is, however, available as a FHIR package. So my question is: Can one render element from a publicly available FHIR package in a Simplifier IG (given that the package registry is \"powered by simplifier\" <span aria-label=\"smirk\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f60f\" role=\"img\" title=\"smirk\">:smirk:</span> )?</p>",
