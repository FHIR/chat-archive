Validating QuestionnaireResponse against them is a major part of the \"IG functionality\", they are actively used validation artefacts - hence, it is key that they get loaded by any tooling using the FHIR package for this IG. However, I am not sure how to do this. I initially created a package in Simplifier using the options \"Move all resources to the package folder\" = true and \"Move the examples to the examples folder\"=true. However, as Simplifier classifies Questionnaires as examples, they land in the examples folder and are not seen by e.g. the JAR validator. I suspect unticking the latter setting will merely mean that the Questionnaires don't get included at all (whereas I want them in the package folder, I guess) - but would rather not release a new package merely to test that <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span>. How can I solve this?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Great question <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194703\">@Morten Ernebjerg</span>. You could uncheck 'Move the examples to the examples folder' which should keep them in /package instead of /package/examples. But it will also put any other examples you have there. I made an example here: <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/packages/acme.base/0.0.10-no-move-examples\">https://simplifier.net/packages/acme.base/0.0.10-no-move-examples</a>, which has all Patient examples in /package directly.</p>\n<p>You can also choose to fully arrange the folder structure yourself. Then you would structure already in your <a href=\"http://Simplifier.net\">Simplifier.net</a> Project everything in /package and /package/examples how you want it, and uncheck both move options on package creation.</p>\n<p>I'll discuss whether we should reclassify Questionnaire instances as conformance resources instead of Examples!</p>\n<p>Finally, you can create multiple package lines from your project. So if you want to test package creation secretly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From the Packages tab, click Create new package</li>\n<li>Select Status: Private</li>\n<li>Test creating package versions to there, until you're happy. Note that private packages won't be accessible by outside tools (and even some <a href=\"http://in-Simplifier.net\">in-Simplifier.net</a> tools)</li>\n<li>Only then create a new package on your official, public package line</li>\n</ul>",

In the File Manager (Project page &gt; Manage &gt; File manager) you can check all the file paths.<br>\nDownloading full project + change folder structure + empty project (with File manager) + uploading project is likely easier, if you're not afraid of losing things like resource history and linked issues.</p>",
