This is also the first release that will reflect on what Simplifier pricing plan you are and what type of Forge usage corresponds with that (see our previous announcements on the new Forge license and pricing model: <a href=\"https://blog.fire.ly/2019/10/03/securing-the-future-of-forge/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://blog.fire.ly/2019/10/03/securing-the-future-of-forge/\">blog one</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.fire.ly/2019/11/05/the-future-of-forge-part-ii/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://blog.fire.ly/2019/11/05/the-future-of-forge-part-ii/\">blog two</a>).</p>\n<p>Other changes include <strong>improvements to using packages</strong> from the <a href=\"http://Simplifier.net\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Simplifier.net\">Simplifier.net</a> package registry in Forge. You could already directly install your FHIR packages in Forge (under the Dependencies tab), but now it will help you to make sure you are only using the supported FHIR versions with the right Forge version.</p>\n<p>Support for the technical correction FHIR versions (3.0.2 and 4.0.1) will come soon, with the next release.
