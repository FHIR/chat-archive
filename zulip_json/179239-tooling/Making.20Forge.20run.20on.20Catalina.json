Are there plans to make this possible (or maybe someone knows a workaround...)? It would be great for us mac people, especially since not updating the OS may not be an option due to corporate/institutional policies.</p>",

We're a victim of Catalina not supporting 32-bit applications anymore and Forge being compiled as such.</p>\n<p>In the meantime I assume that running Windows in a VM on Mac and running Forge on that should still work for Catalina users, but this does require a Windows license.</p>",
