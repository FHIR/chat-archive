We plan to have two sessions where we discuss the guide and show off some work that the IBM team has done in creating AdverseEvent reports based on Transfusions and Vaccinations.  Session 1 will be a Technical discussion where IBM will show their Chart Review tool that takes FHIR EHR data, combines it with input from a clinician, and creates an ICSR submission in either FAERS or VAERS format.  We will also show the external transformation of the ICSR reports into the guide's FHIR profiles.  Session 2 will be a less technical discussion of the guide including the mapping and how we chose to represent transfusions as well as vaccination terminology.</p>\n<p>Please register for the Connectathon and let us know if you'll be coming to one of our tracks!</p>",
