But I agree in the context of this IG, the manifest itself is the obvious starting point to test publishers, and breaking if the user pastes that into the front box is silly.  I just pushed up an update that will work if you paste in a direct link to the manifest in the front-page box (e.g. <code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smart-on-fhir/smart-scheduling-links/master/examples/$bulk-publish</code>).  Future versions of Inferno will likely remove the front page input box.</p>",

But on the other hand, support for the capabilities interaction is a hard requirement in FHIR for a reason.</p>",
