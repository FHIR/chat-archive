I have some historical data that could possibly be used to look at this, at least based on appointment information I've been able to gather from the outside (<a href=\"https://www.vaccinespotter.org/api/#historical\">https://www.vaccinespotter.org/api/#historical</a>), but I haven't really had a chance to dig into this myself yet (I think some folks in HHS were looking into this historical data; not sure if they've done anything with it yet, but happy to point you in their direction if it would help). Purely anecdotally, as I'm sure many others have seen, earlier on, appointments seemed like they could disappear in less than a minute, particularly in more populated areas. But now it seems like appointments are sticking around much longer (but not sure if that's due to increased supply or decreasing demand).</p>",
