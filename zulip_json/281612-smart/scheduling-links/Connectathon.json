Since we want to move quickly, we're thinking about doing this as more of an asynchronous event than a typical HL7 Connectathon, to allow folks who are ready <em>now</em> to get started quickly (and to allow others to join as they come up to speed).  We'd still have a couple of \"in-person\" (live)  sessions to discuss progress and wrap up, but would expect most debugging and discussion to happen here. Would love to get thoughts, ideas, etc on this plan :-)</p>",
