I think there were a number of other errors/warnings that probably fall into 'data completeness' category, which is a bit more fuzzy from a requirements perspective, and I'd like to refine how our tests deal with those this week depending on what the group thinks is important/reasonable.  Let me know if you have trouble running those tests or disagree with the results.</p>",
