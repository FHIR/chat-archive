You can find it here: <a href=\"https://github.com/inferno-community/fsh-smart-scheduling-links\">https://github.com/inferno-community/fsh-smart-scheduling-links</a>. The FSH files are in <code>input/fsh</code>, and the resulting IG resources (<code>StructureDefinition</code>, <code>ValueSet</code>, etc.) are in <code>resources/</code>. This is just a first pass, so let me know if you have any suggestions! I'll probably be iterating on things in this repo pretty quickly.</p>",
