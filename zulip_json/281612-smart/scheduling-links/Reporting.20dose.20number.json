However, I'm curious how valuable the community thinks having a dose number in the capacity reporting really is.   I expect most patients will schedule their second dose while they are getting their first dose, so that reduces (significantly I think) the value of reporting second dose capacity.  I have seen that some folks aren't getting their second dose, so maybe there is some utility for reporting second dose for folks that initially skipped their second dose.</p>",

Overall I expect that getting to granular appointment timing annotated with specific products is more important than annotating with \"dose #\" especially if the dose # is hard to know. But I'm very interested in understanding what makes this hard to know -- is it because organizations don't have a good process for allocating vaccine doses across dose 1 vs dose 2 appointments? Or ... they have a process but it's not easy to apply?</p>",
