Esp “categorical” availability scans (eg looking across multiple endpoints to piece together current availability at multiple locations)?  </p>\n<p>This “categorical” availability seems to be a pressing need systemically and is causing a bit of thrash with different amateur/volunteer services springing up to manually check for availability.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nHenry<br>\n...
