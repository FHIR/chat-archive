They are focused on the financial flows (banking, insurance, payments, etc), when pressed it was because these things can be made fully virtual, leverage the fact money is a concept in blockchain, and the biggest problem these flows have is the double-spend problem. The double-spend problem is well addressed in blockchain.  Failure-mode is simply loss of money.</p>",

Smart-contracts can exist elsewhere, indeed our FHIR Consent and OAuth (UMA) are two examples of smart-contracts. The difference being that a specific chain has a specific smart-contract language, and mechanism to execute that specific language.  So a patient might offer access to their data (which is elsewhere) to anyone that can satisfy a smart-contract they put into a public chain.    Unfortunately this best opportunity is what I described over a year ago given Grahame's original ask  <a href=\"https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2016/05/healthcare-blockchain-big-data.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2016/05/healthcare-blockchain-big-data.html\">https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2016/05/healthcare-blockchain-big-data.html</a></p>",

The goal of SMOAC is to provide a decentralized identity and permission fabric (upon HyperLedger FABRIC) that is both extremely secure and trusted as well as enabling of new architectural and business model options. It fully adheres to all of John's proscriptions (e.g., FHIR Resources never touch the FHIRBlockchain, it focuses upon expansionary use of smart contracts, etc); indeed IMHO it could serve to further FHIR's essentially decentralized architecture (by finishing the job of allowing health system IDNs to engage patients directly in the access &amp; control of their own PHI &amp; PII--w/o necessarily relying upon EHR vendor authorization)</p>\n<p>The operative phrase in the last sentence above is <em>\"could serve to further FHIR...\"</em> .  Much work will remain to be done if/when the idea were to get traction within the FHIR community--e.g., as Grahame's observations point out, the use of a permissioned blockchain implies more of an ecosystem governance challenge than a technical breakthrough. All we'll be humbly asking for next month (when we more completely disclose the concept) is that you give it a careful look and consider reviewing the current <em>proof of concept</em> work now underway.  And, if all that pans out, perhaps John could consider taking this idea up in his Security WG?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>*FHIR, of course, is a registered trademark of HL7 Intl</p>",
