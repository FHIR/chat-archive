Financial transactions for payment requests, coverage, and possibly others that don't need anything other than a pseudonym... possibly.   The worry I have here is that the security of blockchain relies on those holding an identity to be careful not to be exposed (usually by their participation pattern, or stupid acts). Once exposed, they are fully exposed. Also they must absolutely protect their private key.  Any effort to have ways to recover private keys, weakens the whole system. Any loss of a private key in current use of blockchain, simply results in the loss (destruction) of funny-money. Yes funny-money with potential value, but loss of just money... When we have the loss (destruction) of PHI, we have a different 'risk' evaluation.</p>",

And, I realize that some see a permissioned blockchain as less sexy and/or otherwise less deserving of DLT consideration.  But IFO disagree: a permissioned blockchain--one that relies upon off-chain storage of PHI (e.g., behind FHIR servers) and instead focuses upon federated PII and AAA, could enable an interesting new variety of new FHIR-enabled business models.<br>\nAs for the issue around pseudonymous PII and lost private key recovery, there are interesting new solutions emerging there as well--e.g., uPort and HyperLedger Indy's  \"trusted witness/multi-sig\" approaches.  Moreover, security at the digital wallet level presents a far smaller attack surface to the overall network; in other words, owing both to their distributed architectures as well as multi-levels of advanced cryptography, DLT-based solutions are inherently more secure as well as use-case more nimble than traditional centralized networks.</p>",
