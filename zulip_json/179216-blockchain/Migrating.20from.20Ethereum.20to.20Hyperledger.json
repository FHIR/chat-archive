We're moving to DokChain, Hyperledger, and PokitDok.  Just fyi.  </p>",

Ethereum has a larger market share and more established technology, but is focused on fintech and I see them as not having a good culture fit with healthcare organizations (similar problems as Uber has had).  PokitDok is a healthcare IT infrastructure company, and their product (called DokChain) uses the Hyperledger blockchain (from IBM/Intel, I believe).</p>",

They're mostly just up-and-coming fintech players trying to displace existing fintech players.  So I'm not overly optimistic that things are going to progress too much more.   </p>\n<p>I did work out the details of how to make a Blockchain HIE profitable using FHIR based microtransactions billed to an insurance company.  Not fundamentally different than the UMA usecase that John described elsewhere or what Microsoft has provided in the past in their ActiveDirectory products; but I do think the blockchain smart contracts could be an important service for authentication servers that could change the interoperability landscape.     </p>\n<p>But, honestly, I'm starting to think that IPFS is a more interesting technology for interoperabiility/synchronizing between locations.   </p>",

Inasmuch as I have previously exposed some elements of this blockchain-based concept to some of you a bit prematurely, we've been careful to hold back this time.
