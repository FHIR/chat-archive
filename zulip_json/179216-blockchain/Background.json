That Patients collection now uses the FHIR 1.6.0 schema.  When the Patient object gets created, it writes items into the blockchain ledger.  Next step is to put an event hook on the Patients collection, so the blockchain ledger is updated when updates come over the REST API.  The demo is pretty clever.  The blockchain mining is happening in the background; and you can see the ledger get hashed and updated when a Patient is created or viewed (through the user interface).  Meteor on FHIR apps which use the FHIR collections can all benefit from a single blockchain mining node; and once we get the event hooks, it should be supported via REST APIs also.</p>",
