Will Robinson Danger!\"<br>\nA much longer post would reflect upon the proven virtues of distributed computing and decentralized data over their centralized antecedents.  More recently, cyber attack threats have added to the desirability of narrowed attack surfaces--think self sovereign personal financial info over Equifax-like honeypots. Now, as we all hail Apple's Medical Record announcement (in particular over its use an open FHIR standard), let's pause to reflect upon one of the hidden benefits of the EHR status-quo. It's more-or-less distributed among countless systems behind heavy heterogeneous security! Moreover, FHIR's RESTful web services architecture would promise to keep it that way: distributed, secure and under the control of it respective owner/custodians.<br>\nNow, enter Apple (and Google right behind it with a less disguised cloud strategies).  While having access to all the PHI at the device level's doubtless a good thing, how comfortable are we in seeing it then uploaded to prospectively re-centralized DBMS? Where/how will the fine-grained patient permission of its use <em>there</em> be governed?<br>\n`just a cautionary thought...</p>",
