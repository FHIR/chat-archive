Initially we could put whole FHIR Medication resource on the chain, revisions would be either forbidden or done with a revision block holding pointer to old, copy of new. All reference would be canonical, given need to support distributed ledger. We could use Provenance to track movements, like packaging, boxing, trucking pickup, trucking deliver, tempreture checks, shock checks, mixing with others into a new Medication... Consensus algorithm would validate source, location, actor, action, and integrity of all. Usecases to walk chain confirming sourcing, quality, and authenticity (no other use of same component).</p>",
