Or is there a strict standard that says that is not allowed?</p>\n<p>Kind regards</p>\n<p>Sharla Passariello</p>\n<p>Edit: this is for HL7v2</p>",

Only if the field explicitly includes \"\" (double quote) is it meant to be deleted.  A blank field, absent double quotes, only means that the message does not contain that data.  It can be known on the source system, just not included.</p>\n<p>Depending on the standard/implementation guide/profile the field may be required.  If in that case the field is blank, it is still not an indication to delete, rather an error by the sender to conform to the proper standard/implementation guide/profile.</p>",
