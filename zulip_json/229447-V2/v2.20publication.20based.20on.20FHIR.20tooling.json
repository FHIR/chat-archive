What you can see at the refactored site, thx Grahame, is what we are aiming at. Our  plan is to have something ready for comment for the next ballot cycle. What you can see is something I generate with scripts from my database. With that procedure we are collecting requirements to get it done. The primary challenge is making it persisting with FHIR resources so that the whole process can be done with FHIR tools. That would be something where FHIR can take advantage from.</p>",
