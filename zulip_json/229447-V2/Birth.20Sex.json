If you want to know how to address the patient, use their gender identity.  If you need a value for clinical decision support, use a \"sex for clinical use\" value. SAAB is a poor option for this since it will often be wrong for transgender patients.  Same for lab reference ranges, health maintenance, modality configuration etc.  The only time SAAB might be useful for clinical purposes is when you are dealing with a newborn.  SAAB is also not the same as legal sex, or even the sex on the birth certificate, since some jurisdictions allow you to update the sex on your birth certificate, but that doesn't mean your SAAB will also change.  If you need a legal sex, just use a current legal sex, not SAAB.</p>",
