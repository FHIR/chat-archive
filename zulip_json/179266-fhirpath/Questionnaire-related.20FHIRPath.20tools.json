One is a %questionnaire context element that points to the questionnaire for the current response.  The second is a question(), item(), qitem() or whatever you'd like to call it function (similar to the 'extension' function) that will give you the Questionnaire.item for the specified linkId.  The last is a function to give you the ordinalValue associated with a particular answer - which might involve grabbing it from the Questionnaire.item.option, but could also involve resolving the value set and grabbing it from the associated code.</p>",
