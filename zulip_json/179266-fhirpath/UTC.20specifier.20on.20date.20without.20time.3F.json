This is surprising to me because the timezone (and Z) can be specified as part of the time, but for some reason for a DateTime one can specify \"Z\" (but not a timezone) even without a time.  Is there a reason to allow something like \"@2018Z\"?   Since the time isn't specified, I am not sure the point of adding \"Z\" is.</p>",
