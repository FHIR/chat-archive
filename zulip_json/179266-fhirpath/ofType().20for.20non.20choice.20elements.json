Can we also use this approach for non choice elements?  This seems to work in the fhirpath.js demo, but wanted to get people's thoughts about using <code>isType()</code> to specify the path of an element.</p>",

You're then filtering to only include the Observation.value occurrences that happen to have a type of string.  It's perfectly legitimate to say Patient.birthDate.isType(date).  However, it's also perfectly useless :)  I.e. you're not going to filter anything because - by definition - if you've got a birthDate, it's going to have a type of 'date'.</p>",
