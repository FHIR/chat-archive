The substitution may refer to identified match groups in the regular expression.</p>\n<p><strong>This example of replace()</strong> will convert a string with a date formatted as MM/dd/yy to dd-MM-yy:* </p>\n<p>Example reference points replaceMatches(), but not replace(), isn't it?</p>\n<p>*6.5. Boolean logic<br>\nFor all boolean operators, the collections passed as operands are first evaluated as booleans (as described in <strong>Boolean Evaluation of Collections</strong>). The operators then use three-valued logic to propagate empty operands.*</p>\n<p>There is no section named Boolean Evaluation of Collections, but 4.5. Singleton evaluation of collections instead</p>",
