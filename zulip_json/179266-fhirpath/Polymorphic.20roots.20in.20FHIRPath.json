This seems to make sense, but I had not implemented this kind of polymorphism in FHIRPath, and we have not documented this in the spec either.  The .NET FHIRPath engine has now been updated to support this construct, but I'd like to get confirmation that this use is intentional - as the same result could be obtained by just doing just <code>meta.lastUpdated</code>, since that would work on any resource as well.</p>",
