For the ~ operator, the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhirpath/2018Sep/#equality\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhirpath/2018Sep/#equality\">spec</a> says, \" values must be equal, comparison is done on values rounded to the precision of the least precise operand.\"  However, this is the = operator, for which the spec says nothing about rounding (at least not that I can see).  There is a mention of supporting at least a 10^-8 step-size, but it permits smaller step sizes, so it hard to say definitely at what point the number should be rounded (how many 6's before that 7). <br>\nI think this the test (and others like it) should be changed from = to ~.</p>",
