The resolution only says, \"Agreed, state explicitly that no other escape sequences are recognized.\"  That by itself is not enough to clarify the behavior.  There are basically three options for something like '\\a':<br>\n1) Render it as \"a\"  (as JavaScript would)<br>\n2) Render it as \"\\a\"<br>\n3) Raise an error<br>\nWhich of the three is chosen is less important than having the choice be explicitly stated, so that the behavior is consistent across implementations.</p>",
