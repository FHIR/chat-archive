Specifically, suggestions to: 1) Add a <code>name</code> attribute to the root Tests type. 2) Add a <code>description</code> element to Tests, Group, and Test, 3) Add a <code>notes</code> element to Tests, Group, and Test (that would be returned with the output of the test if it failed), and 4) Add a <code>reference</code> element to Tests, Group, and Test (to point to the area of the specification the test covers). Here's a diff of the changes applied to the testSchema.xsd in the CQL repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/HL7/cql/commit/4fae369ca9aab802fa971b6a16841911c9083454\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/HL7/cql/commit/4fae369ca9aab802fa971b6a16841911c9083454\">https://github.com/HL7/cql/commit/4fae369ca9aab802fa971b6a16841911c9083454</a></p>",
