For example, for exists(), it says, \"Returns true if the collection has any elements, and false otherwise.\"  Does this mean it returns a collection with a single boolean (sort of like count() returns a collection with an integer) or does it really return a plain boolean?  3.1 says, \"the result of every expression is a collection, even if that expression only results in a single element\".  I am wondering if the documentation should be clarified for the 5.1 functions, or whether they really do deviate from the rule in 3.1.</p>",
