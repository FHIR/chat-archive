This is the string that must be sent after the extension.uri and the '#' in an instance when identifying this particular extension. E.g. For the extension \"http://hl7.org/fhir/Profile/iso-21090#nullFlavor\", the \"code\" would be \"nullFlavor\". **These should generally be lower-camel-case strings**. If the extension is part of another extension, the convention is to use string concatenation. E.g. \"relationParent.type\" as the code for the \"type\" characteristic of the \"relationParent\" extension.</code></p>\n<p>Now, this will cause us to get the same warnings on the extension StructureDefinition names - but I was noticing that it was causing all the 'attribute' names everywhere we used these extensions to have upper-camel-case (matching the name), whereas all other attributes seem to follow the lower-camel-case approach.  So, had to pick an option, and I choose to make the attribute names look more consistent and leave the warnings.  In case this comes up again, I wanted to document it somewhere.  It is certainly possible I am missing something, so welcome any and all feedback.</p>",
