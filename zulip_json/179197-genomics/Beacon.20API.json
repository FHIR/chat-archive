Are you looking at hosting a genomic data server? More of a description of your intended use case would be very helpful.</p>\n<p>In terms of security concerns, that article is a fun read but from a quick review, I don't feel the hypothetical situation it proposes is realistic in today's data climate. Not only does it assume the attacker already knows the whole genome of the person in question, but it also assumes they know two things about the beacon that I don't believe it has to disclose: the number of individuals in the beacon, and the site frequency spectrum (SFS) of the population in the beacon... is this a situation you are concerned with in terms of data security?</p>",
