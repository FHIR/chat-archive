I didn't see the question in the chat until after the meeting so I am replying here.</p>\n<p>Creating a toy example for illustrative purposes:  Var123 is a T at position 500 on sequence SEQ999 instead of a G</p>\n<p>Therefore, I interpret the statement \"Var123 not found\" to mean \"the T allele was not found in this subject's genome at the position homologous to position 500 on sequence SEQ999\".</p>\n<p>If it is known that the T allele was not found at that position, then something else must have been observed there instead, so let's flip the statement to the positive and assume G/A was found there instead:<br>\n\"G/A found in this subject's genome at the position homologous to position 500 on sequence SEQ999\"<br>\nNotice that I chose G/A rather than G/G to make the point that that absence of one allele does not imply the presence of another. :-)</p>\n<p>Note that MolecularVariant does not yet formally support genotypes, but we can put that detail in a black box and express the idea in the positive:<br>\nObservation for patient A points to an instance of MolVar that defines the G/A genotype at position 500 on sequence SEQ999</p>\n<p>I would then create a second Observation <em>derivedFrom</em> the first, which expresses the conclusion that \"the T allele was not found\":<br>\nObservation for patient A derivedFrom &lt;previous Obs&gt;, ref&lt;MolVar/T allele&gt;, value = \"absent\" or \"negative\"</p>\n<p>Decoupling what was actually observed from the interpretations or conclusions that are based on it (whether stated in the positive or negative) allows for re-interpretation of those conclusions without altering the primary Observation.</p>\n<p>Does that help?  I'm interested in your thoughts, especially if they differ from the approach I outlined above.</p>",

What I'm trying to satisfy is the ability to express that, e.g. there was no variant found in the KRAS gene, or we found a variant encoding a BRAF V600E but not elsewhere on the BRAF gene. </p>\n<p>I understand there are too many instances to report all the not-found variants in a gene, and my thinking was primarily surrounding use cases driven by clinical trial matching and therapies where resistance to targeted therapies can be inferred from specific mutations like MEK1 P124Q/S and BRAF inhibitors. This may also just be something that sits on the interpretation side of things and may even be outside the scope of molecularvariant - I'll do a bit more digging and see if I can flesh out the more routine use cases and go from there.</p>",

It is a prediction of the protein sequence that would result if the genomic sequence that was observed was transcribed and translated, assuming there isn't any regulatory or processing weirdness due to things we didn't see or don't yet understand.  Furthermore, the V to E change is degenerate, since there are 4 possible codons for V (GTn) and 2 for E (GAr).  This means that there are several possible changes that could have occurred: GTG =&gt; GAG, GTA =&gt; GAA, GTC =&gt; GAG, etc.  Recording only the protein change does not allow anyone to dig deeper to ask questions about whether a specific genomic change was present.  Finally, I personally do not think it would be accurate to record \"V600E\" as a primary observation <em>unless</em> it was detected through protein sequencing (or similar).
