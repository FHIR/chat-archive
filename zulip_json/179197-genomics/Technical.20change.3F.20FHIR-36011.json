Normally something like renaming an extension wouldn't be a technical change, but this is an extension that we already renamed as part of an earlier JIRA preparing for STU2. I am just suggesting a different name to clear up some possible confusion. So I welcome folks to take a look at the JIRA and provide thoughts.</p>",
