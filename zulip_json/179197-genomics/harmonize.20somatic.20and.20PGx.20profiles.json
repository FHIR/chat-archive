The somatic profile is about the tumor. Our current mechanism of separation is through pre-coordinating Somatic in the profile name.

Similar arguments could be made about <code>associated-therapy</code>, but it gets messy with our current required cardinalities.</p>\n<p>In general, we are looking for a balance here between having \"too many boxes\" (an overwhelming number of profiles not fitting an obvious pattern) and \"big leaky buckets\" (where a \"bucket-like\" implication profile would require a system to look at which components were populated to understand how to process it)... I don't have a solution for this yet, except thinking that our recent decision to frame the IG as general guidance instead of targeting specific use cases may suggest we ought to have one \"bucket-like\" implication to match obs-variant and then smaller use-case specific IGs/sections could derive use-case implications from that profile.</p>",
