My concern is any documentation that might need to be created to discuss how the profiles could / should be used in the two different use cases.  Seems odd to use a PGx named profile when doing a somatic test, even if the data it is delivering is the same(ish).  If I recall - I think we have more than a few trackers in this space, and it is likely we just need to evaluate most of the impact profiles for overlap.</p>",
