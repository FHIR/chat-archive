I suggest to change the name of associated phenotype to be specific  - but clinicians will never see it as a user of the data. The names are/should only be visible in the backend. However, 'risk-of' might be clearer. Regards Cancer component and codes , there's ICD-O-3 and SNOMEDCT to consider. Locking down to a code set will be tricky, but no more tricky than systems already have to deal with when it comes to terminology. <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"249407\">Rachel Kutner</span>  could you perhaps use a different display in your UI? can your system accommodate that? Just trying to get at where the  push back is coming from...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192123\">@Bret H</span>  Yes, we definitely can change the display name for this field. I wanted to make sure I interpreted the field correctly and see if there is a clinical consensus for a term that can be used with less confusion for clinicians on the front end.</p>\n<p>I was hoping this work group would be able to suggest some possible alternatives which we could explore with clinicians to find a clearer, more specific alternative. Additionally, if a field is introduced in the future that is supposed to encompass phenotypes that have been reported on a patient and is associated with a result or finding, I'd like to make sure we don't choose a term that could be confusing between the two.</p>",
