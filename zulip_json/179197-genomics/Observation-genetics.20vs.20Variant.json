But in Genomics Implementation Guide at <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/sequencing.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/sequencing.html</a> variants are reported using a Variant profile linked to a Genomic Finding Observation. From what i understand both profiles can be used to save genetics variants, but i can't quite understand which one to use.<br>\nMy question is: which one of the two profiles should i follow as base model to build my solution? Why should i use one instead of another?<br>\nI'm sorry for my lack of knowledge, and i hope some of you could try to explain to me.</p>\n<p>Thank you and kind regards.</p>",
