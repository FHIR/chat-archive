We plan on using grouper to house the Observations related to each component and would like to use Task/Recommendation for the recommendation. However, task/recommendation is currently only available as a DR extension. What is the best way for us to correlate the Observation and associated recommendation for each component?<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/DfqKdf_RQhtTnUk6KJ4AVlZE/Screen-Shot-2019-11-19-at-5.47.29-PM.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2019-11-19-at-5.47.29-PM.png\">Report Sample</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/DfqKdf_RQhtTnUk6KJ4AVlZE/Screen-Shot-2019-11-19-at-5.47.29-PM.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Report Sample\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/DfqKdf_RQhtTnUk6KJ4AVlZE/Screen-Shot-2019-11-19-at-5.47.29-PM.png\"></a></div><p>Appreciate any guidance for this.
