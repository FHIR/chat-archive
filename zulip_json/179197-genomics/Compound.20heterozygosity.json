Would anyone consider representing this as a single variant, where ALT=\"GT,GTT\" and allelic state is something like 'compound heterozygous'? I've been using the former representation, but just curious...</p>",

This can include variant-specific information that doesn't take into account other context (including other variants found on the patient)</li>\n<li>The annotation/interpretation layer over that answers \"how does this result affect the patient\". </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've thought about this a fair bit because there are 2 layers we need to clearly represent so as not to create confusion. The population-level assessment of a variant (pathogenic, benign, etc) vs the patient-level assessment (is this patient affected by the variant - this might need to take into account more than just genomic information, more than one variant result, etc.). I haven't yet found a great differentiation for these types of information, so my suggestion comes from my brainstorming what might be a nice solution for disambiguating that information.</p>",
