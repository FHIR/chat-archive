The comment I made on the call was that the former is ambiguous. I thought I would explain my reasoning a bit more here, if only to make sure my understanding is correct <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span> .</p>\n<p>When you look at a VCF file, the #CHROM field doesn't represent a chromosome number, but rather, a pointer to a contig in the VCF header:</p>\n<p>##fileformat=VCFv4.1<br>\n...<br>\n##contig=&lt;ID=1,assembly=b37,length=249250621&gt;<br>\n...<br>\n##contig=&lt;ID=GL000191.1,assembly=b37,length=106433&gt;<br>\n...<br>\n#CHROM  POS ID  REF ALT QUAL    FILTER  INFO    FORMAT  Sample<br>\n1 14370 .

So, if I simply tell you I have a variant on Chr 1, build37, and I don't tell you the RefSeq, how can I differentiate between these two VCF rows?</p>\n<p>Also, my understanding is that GA4GH's refget API is designed to further reduce ambiguity, by introducing a unique identifier for each reference sequence, such as:</p>\n<p>##contig=&lt;ID=21,length=48129895,assembly=B37,md5=2979a6085bfe28e3ad6f552f361ed74d&gt;<br>\n##contig=&lt;ID=22,length=51304566,assembly=B37,md5=a718acaa6135fdca8357d5bfe94211dd&gt;</p>\n<p>So maybe in a future iteration of the IG, we need to make room for this checkSum too.</p>",

I do think in the case above one would be required to represent the second call \"GL000191.1\" using an accession and not an \"assembly+chr#\" approach. If I gave the impression that there was only one way to do it, then I misspoke. But, like hgvs, folks use this assembly+chr# to convey the indirect reference to the accession which is presumed to be in the primary assembly of the \"assembly\" portion of the pairing.  I've always questioned the practice myself, but folks do it, probably because in large portions of calls it is likely called against the accessions in the primary assembly mapped by chromosomes.</p>\n<p>So, the question for the CG IG is whether or not it will support both approaches or will it mandate that refseq accessions are the only way to represent?  It then opens the door again to whether hgvs should be formalized to include the accession or whether we should keep it as a nice to have and assume the critical component attributes that are embedded in the hgvs expression are pulled out into required attributes to represent the allele or other types of genetic variation that the sender may be attempting to share.</p>\n<p>And I do think the refget (and VR) digests (checkSums) should have a place in the model.  I think it will naturally present itself when we get a real variant model and set of data types created that will enable us to share variation data more consistently and precisely.  I'm holding out hope this will occur when the IM work is finally refactored back into the CG IG spec and we convince the FMG that we actually need some core data types to deal with the complex and unique constructs within the  clinical genomics domain.</p>",

But, nevertheless, there are many folks that use the assembly+chr# to convey which reference sequence was used as the basis for the positions and change that the variant is made up of. </p>\n<p>So, the Baylor HGSC lab uses the assembly+chr# approach to communicate this information in eMERGE.  We would like to support it.</p>\n<p>If we use the \"cytogenic-location\" component, I could simply apply the chromosome value set referenced above since this is an \"unbounded\" CodeableConcept and it would work.  However, if we do that, we would be presuming a specific implementation detail that is useful only within the emerge pilot.  Since chromosome# is arguably as useful of a value and maybe more so than something like gene symbol it doesn't sit well. </p>\n<p>The argument is really about precision. Having a component that is designed to relate a constrained value set is useful to all and and requires no negotiations between sender and receiver. Passing chromosome via cytogenic-location would require all to be required to use some type of regex expression to validate the \"text\" value being passed and then parse out the chromosome (presuming it passed). Or to inspect whether or not a coded value  from the valueset (that was is not bound to the component) is a legit chromosome value from said value set. Or both. Or some other contrived method.</p>\n<p>I get the desire for flexibility and reuse. Its a slippery slope either way. It comes back to some basic principles in how the group is determining what components are worthy of specification and which can be \"generalized\" and left to the individual implementers to negotiate amongst themselves.</p>\n<p>If you think that cytogenic-location component is the preferred way to share some type of controlled values for chromosomes, could you please demonstrate how this should be done in a standard way that does not leave it up to implementers to vary?  I'd be happy to follow a standard practice on this if it can be acheived. I just would rather not have to tell the various consumers of our message that they must investigate and parse out the chromosome # from a cytogenic-location text field. Nor would I prefer to say that we all have to presume our cytogenic-location value is bound to a value set of chromosomes but other sources using this component may not use it the same way.</p>",

I mean you can get accession, position, ref and alt from an HGVS expression, so why have separate components for those as well. When I ask the domain experts I work with if they think a chromosome is the same or different than a cytoband location or chromosome location they think one is the basis for other (like a whole-part association).  The location is not the thing, it is a specific place within it (even though it may be the entire place represented by the start and end point within it).</p>",
