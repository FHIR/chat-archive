If we move to a single profile it is left to implementers to use the correct value sets. We can leave it to other groups to determine more constrained profiles - but this can lead to different choices in values sets for each observation.code. In other words, the single profile would enable/accommodate the current inconsistencies we see in value sets. Just a note - if we as a group favor simplicity in architecture then so be it.
