        "content": "<p>Here is Robs response to the PR:<br>\nI'm wondering if the description for 'refseq' should be \"RefSeq: NCBI Reference Sequence Database\", as it is shown on the NLM website, rather than \"REFSEQ : National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequences\" as you currently have it? Maybe that doesn't matter, particularly if you have a different source for the description that you used. Regarding 'http' vs. 'https' for refseq, I think it's not entirely clear which one you should use here. I note that '<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/</a> is automatically redirected to '<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/</a>', so I'm not sure that specifying it with 'http' actually helps or is the best choice. All of the other terminologies in terminologies-systems currently are 'http', but I don't think there is an absolute rule about that (at least not that I'm thinking of), and the general rule is that if the publisher defines a url then we use that one. Another thing that I see is that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/varId\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/varId\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/varId</a> currently doesn't resolve, whereas <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar</a> does. Is that what you expect? In general it's good practice, of course, to use urls that do actually resolve to something useful. I also don't understand why adding \"PharmGKB Accession ID\" is useful (or even correct?) in the context where you added it?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Regarding the points:<br>\n1) Naming of RefSeq: To me both terms are equivalent, but i agree with Rob to alter the description to the version of the NCBI Homepage<br>\n2) to align with other CodeSystem SIDs i would have the refseq URI starting with http. It still resolves (with a redirect)<br>\n3) <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/varId\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/varId\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/varId</a> doesnt resolve. But we need to distinguish between clinvar varIds and allele IDs as these both have integer codes which are overlapping. An alternative would be to define our own URI (e.g. <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/clinvar/varid\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/clinvar/varid\">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/clinvar/varid</a>). To keep the updated URI closer to the former clinvar SID i would prefer adding the path varid to the existing URI<br>\n4) We added \"PharmGKB Accession ID\" to PharmGKB to express that this Codesystem contains the Accession ID and not every single term (which are not coded) of PharmGKB<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194952\">@Julian Sass</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191913\">@Kevin Power</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191405\">@Rob Hausam</span></p>",
