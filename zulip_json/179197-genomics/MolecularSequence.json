You're thinking too deeply, I think : ^ ) and we've had lots of discussions on the purpose of MolSeq without standing on a final definition. But, in my opinion its a place to send contiguous chunks of sequence data, can be used as a reference sequence itself, useful for things like entire viral genomes. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192198\">@Bob Freimuth</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"193751\">@Bob Dolin</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"209510\">@Larry Babb</span>   might consider MolSeq as the Allele representation in our FHIR IG of the allele in the Information Model Bob is guiding. Where we're reporting the sequence that is in a specimen/sample/patient - not so much the variant. That MolSeq can also hold variant information is indeed a point of confusion potentially. But our group needs to provide a final determination. Something to consider.</p>",
