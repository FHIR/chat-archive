But, we lacked a real expert in the room at the WGM, so anyone else is welcome to weigh in.</p>",

A <strong>coverage</strong> of 120 reads per base achieves a theoretical sensitivity of 99% for the detection of variants with a ≥ 10% NAF. In this case, 95.1% of the targeted regions were covered by a minimum of 120 high-quality <strong>sequencing reads per base</strong>.
