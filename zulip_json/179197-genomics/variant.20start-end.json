But maybe this isn't a real problem.<br>\nBut i can also imagine a use case where i want to transport the actual or estimated breakpoints and the inner outer ones as well.<br>\nAfter reading:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3531204/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3531204/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3531204/</a><br>\nI would say we would need a component for actual breakpoint complemented by an confidence intervall extension?</p>",
