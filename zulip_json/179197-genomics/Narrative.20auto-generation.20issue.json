After the resources were created, only Patient and DiagnosticReport's narrative were generated as HTML format, the other 2 resources were not.</p>\n<p>For Specimen and DiagnosticReport I am using different profiles (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/StructureDefinition/diagnosticreport\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/StructureDefinition/diagnosticreport\">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/StructureDefinition/diagnosticreport</a> or specimen), and for Patient and Organization I am using original FHIR resource type.</p>\n<p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>\n<p>Fei</p>",
