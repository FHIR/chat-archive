I agree with your use of the components that exist. It is not uncommon for synonyms to develop in a space. E.g.  E.coli 'positive' and E.coli. 'detected' do not have a meaningful difference for a physician but a lab technologist sees them as different. There is no functional decision making difference between reporting oncogenic and tumor driver. IN fact, ask an oncologist how they would use a report of Pathogenic variant and associated phenotype as tumor type VS Tumor driver variant. If we were a solely data driven organization, we would carryout a survey to see if there is really a difference.  AND we would absolutely note the 1) role of the respondent, 2) level of training/experience with molecular lab work. But we have to work with the information that is brought to us or that we can find.</p>",

Driver = pathogenic, passenger = benign. In our use-case i would add another explicit driver passenger coding.</p>",
