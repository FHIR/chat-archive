These terms are in this group because they can be calculated explicitly from the type and location of the variation, unlike the functional consequence which must be established experimentally (or predicted).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So perhaps if ClinVar can't compute it, they can take it from a submitter.

It is not part of the report itself.   </p>\n<p>I also got a reply from my contact at Invitae - this is what he said: <br>\n\"Please see below - it looks we use these, but they won't appear in our report data. </p>\n<p>(How) Do you use ontological terms in your workflow for variant annotation (Such as Molecular Consequence and Functional Consequence per below)?<br>\nDo you use Clinvar and/or Sequence Ontology? Do you need to use Clinvar (or other) labels in your reporting? </p>\n<p>We use Molecular Consequence Sequence Ontology (SO) terms to calculate our variant names and to aid in variant interpretation, but they are not directly used or displayed in the report data. When experimental data is available in the literature then we will also take the Functional Consequence of the variant into consideration for variant interpretation. This is captured through Sherloc evidence codes (PMID: 28492532). We do not use ClinVar data in our reporting, but do reference ClinVar Variation IDs where available for the general information of the clinician.\"</p>",
