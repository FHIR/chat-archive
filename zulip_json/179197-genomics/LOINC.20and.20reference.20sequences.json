        "content": "<p>Hi, we are needing to report out genomic variants in the short term (July timeframes) - and I totally understand that the CG stuff is all work in progress - so the best I am aiming for is aligning with things where they exist. So one of the fields we need to report out is the human reference sequence that was used. And I've found a useful LOINC code for that and an answer list. But the answer list seems incomplete (it doesn't have GRCh38 for instance, and there are subversions of GRCh37 that are apparently important ). I don't know anything about LOINC processes or timeframes - is it likely we can get answers added to LOINC? Or should I develop my own codesystem?</p>",
