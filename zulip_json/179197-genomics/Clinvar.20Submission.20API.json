BRIDG is a group focused on Biomedical research and if the elements specific to research/studies are to be included, I'd recommend a collaboration with that group or moving those items to that group to give guidance on.

My analysis is available for comment at: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fLNIj5QXRbfBQqvUoolC7m6AvyYg9x-dCkvKqMsEkKM/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fLNIj5QXRbfBQqvUoolC7m6AvyYg9x-dCkvKqMsEkKM/edit?usp=sharing</a> Here's what I saw: IMPORTANT THIS IS AS OF Oct 11, 2021. Both groups are actively evolving<br>\nClinVarAPI: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/api_http/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/api_http/</a><br>\nCG IG: <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/</a><br>\nGenerally, ClinVar submission is meant to be a self-contained record of information on a variant-disease pair (potentially including results from multiple individuals) for deposit in a knowledge repository, a variant database. The CG IG profiles are meant to communicate the clinically relevant information on a genetic result for a patient. The EMR provides additional details on the patient and the data is considered in light of the clinical record of the patient. ClinVar is a knowledge repository. As such it goes beyond what would be sent in a non-research report. At most a trio would be referred to in a lab test. Again, a clinvar submission assumes a grouping of individuals with a singular variant focus. For Healthcare transactions, the focus is on a singular individual with a grouping of variants found in a particular test. </p>\n<p>ClinVar treats therapeutic implications with the same elements as it uses for diagnostic implications. The CinVar clinical significance description field maps into both the Diagnostic implication and Therapeutic implications.<br>\ne.g. A 'drug response'  association in a ClinVar entry would be mapped with Therapeutic implication. A 'Pathogenic' association in a ClinVar entry would be mapped to Diagnostic implication<br>\nClinVar has 'protective' in clinical significance description value set and 'risk factor.'  Protective is a different meaning than benign. Similarly, 'risk factor' is a different implication than pathogenic. However, putting them in the same value set as our current terms will complicate the current meaning of the data element - i.e. make it harder to find all the 'pathogenic' variants for a disease as some instances of data might have 'risk factor' and not use 'pathogenic' or 'likely pathogenic.' Should be discussed. There is the Prognosis component in the CG IG which could be used.<br>\nAlso, ClinVar has 'confers sensitivity' in clinical significance. Might consider how to handle this in the Therapeutic profile as drug sensitivity. The CG IG prognosis component could be used.</p>\n<p>The variantSet variant in ClinVar maps well into the CG IG variant profile. ClinVar associates chromosomal position information data elements in one group. The ClinVar element variant type maps to multiple variant elements (component:dna-chg-type, component:molecular-consequence, component:amino-acid-chg-type).<br>\nThe ClinVar variantSet variant has referenceCopyNumber, this is not in the CG IG.<br>\nThe CG IGs components for Variant component:molecular-consequence and Diagnostic Implication component:functional-effect gives a greater vocabulary for describing the consequences of the variant than the ClinVar API.</p>\n<p>ClinVar API assertionCriteria element is not specifically present in the CG IG, but it is part of the attribution elements in FHIR which indicate the observer.</p>\n<p>POPULATIONS? observedIn element in the ClinVar API is interesting, somewhat similar to CG IG FHIR use of patient but meant for describing the group of subjects the ClinVar submission record is about. Generally observedIn looks more like what would be expected to be seen in a research study. The items are interesting but not a report for an individual patient's genomic result. The clinicalFeatures field could be mapped to Condition sent with Patient. But with FHIR access to the Patient clinical features is typically a given in the recipient system. One could envision using Family history to report the types of data seen here for a Trio analysis. A data element like observedIn is well suited for a knowledge repository and something like it could be used to return Population results from an EMR.</p>",

I can do a line by line mapping from variantSet:variant to the CG variant if you need it. The mapping is pretty straightforward, except where noted above. I looked at all the data elements in the API submission model. Happy to have someone from ClinVar comment on my notes (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fLNIj5QXRbfBQqvUoolC7m6AvyYg9x-dCkvKqMsEkKM/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fLNIj5QXRbfBQqvUoolC7m6AvyYg9x-dCkvKqMsEkKM/edit?usp=sharing</a> ). The variantType field needed to be mapped to multiple fields. Also, good to think about the under used CG IG FHIR component: prognosis in Genomic implications.</p>",
