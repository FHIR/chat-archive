The main purpose of this IG is to specify a Universal document standard for a Genetic Testing Report (GTR) typically sent out from a genetic laboratory to recipients who ordered the report. The GTR IG targets both human viewing and machine processing by representing the data in a renderable format along with structured entries; these entries are associated by 'clinical genomic statement' templates defined by this guide, which could empower clinical decision support by conveying clinical genomics semantics in an explicit way. This guide is defined as ‘Universal’ as it is flexible enough to accommodate various use cases, e.g. in translational medicine and clinical environments or of different genetic testing types.<br>\nFor more information see:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=292\" title=\"http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=292\">http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=292</a></p>\n<p>GAPS<br>\n14.1 Laboratory order entry<br>\nOne significant gap is the need to develop a laboratory order implementation guide for clinical sequencing/molecular diagnostics, which is capable of including relevant clinical history and a fully structured family history with familial mutations and risk assessment. While many laboratories currently use electronic ordering, some laboratory orders are still paper- or PDF-based. However, as genetic analysis becomes a standards part of clinical care, paper-based order entry will not scale.</p>\n<p>Please schedule time at an upcoming meeting to discuss or if the WG will meet virtually in May - then provide time for the discussion at that time</p>",
