It sounds like there could be several reports, some of which test only a single biospecimen while others test both tumor and normal specimens.  We'll need to support a single report that has both tumor and normal results, but I suspect we'll also need a way to make higher-level statements about tests that are reported separately.

The specimen identity should be attached to the variant data (we're all agreeing there),  but the biggest problem is that we also identify the TUMOR as part of the patient. With a microorganism it is easy to determine who is who. With TRIO analysis, the clinical lab community is in a similar state - consider that the parents genetic sequence may only be recorded in the probands electronic record. But it would be obvious that mom and dad are not the same person as the proband - a smart system would give mom and dad unique identifiers (i.e. unique patient records in the system - yep, even if they are not ever going to be 'legally' treated or seen in the system) and use a family linkage to the proband....find a system that does that!</p>",
