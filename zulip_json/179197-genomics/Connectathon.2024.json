How does that code decide what you actually mean? The base extension allows both, and says, choose one. That means you actually have to choose, and you do that by setting the cardinality one of them to 0. All the extension processing logic works that way. So just set it to 0.</p>\n<p>As for where this is documented.... I don't know. It's obvious to me. But I'm ok to make it explicit somewhere if you can identify the most logical place</p>",

In addition to variants with precise endpoints (where, for instance, we can use SPDI normalization), I think we can also describe a strategy for 'normalizing' variants with imprecise endpoints, where, rather than normalizing to a common canonical form, we normalize to criteria that subsumes the variant. For instance, we can normalize CYP2D6*5 (whole gene deletion) to: </p>\n<p>(outer-start&lt;NC_000022.10:42522500 AND outer-end&gt;NC_000022.10:42526883) AND ((dna-chg-type=DEL) OR (dna-chg-type=CNV AND copy-number&lt;2))</p>",
