Per Larry, the original images were created with LucidChart but the ones on the ReadTheDocs website should be at full resolution and usable. Let me know if you run into any issues with using the images.</p>\n<p>Also, I checked with the eMERGE Phase III Network Coordinating Center on using the images, they suggest citing the network website ( <a href=\"https://emerge-network.org/\">https://emerge-network.org/</a> ) and our FHIR paper. However, our FHIR paper is still in the works, would you mind citing the ACMG sequencing paper until it is ready?</p>\n<p>Apologies if this seems rather convoluted, please do let me know if you have any questions.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nMullai</p>",
