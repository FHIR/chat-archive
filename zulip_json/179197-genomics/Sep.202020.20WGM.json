If you can let us know what days you will be available, and where you are in the world, we hope to put together a schedule that will allow everyone to participate.  It will require some flexibility, and the virtual WGM means no warm cookie breaks (<span aria-label=\"sad\" class=\"emoji emoji-2639\" role=\"img\" title=\"sad\">:sad:</span>), but we will all find ways to work through it.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>",
