I would be particularly interested in why the current mechanisms for phasing do not work. BTW While I do believe the current components meet the use case, I would like to understand better why/if your team sees a gap. </p>\n<p>It should be more than a desire to have a named component called 'repeat' versus something called 'copy-number' on a molecular level they are the same (and the component names are not meant to be computable). At a higher-level there are differences, but this is similar to the differences at a high-level for an HLA-allele and a Star-allele. For these two the same underlying components are used - i.e. we do not have a component called HLA-allele and one called Start-allele. </p>\n<p>Be good to learn if it is the high-level category and classification that is desired to be communicated.

Genetic data, in this case the positional information, serves as a very valuable source of information for the recipient organization. It has uses in clinical decision support, identifying all instances of data on a patient or population basis, utility in business intelligence (e.g. number of tests which are reporting on overlapping positions - needed for a Chief Data Officer to help guide elimination of waste), population health assessment, research and the positional information is a valuable asset in it's own right. Germline data is hyper-valuable as it can live as long as the patient does. Your clients would be well served to have the capacity to receive it. If the standard is built to accommodate positional information then they can ask the Labs for it and point to a specification. If we don't accommodate positional data then cost and waste can be higher....that's my ten cents.</p>",
