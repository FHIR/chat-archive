In the results interface ecosystem that's been built up over decades around v2, there are mechanisms for queuing errors, acknowledgements in both directions, resubmission capabilities, etc. This is all to some extent being rebuilt around FHIR and there's no FHIR-inherent way of doing it.</p>",

FHIR has more potential than V2. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"249407\">@Rachel Kutner</span>  my point was around structure and use. And yes,  one can argue that the possibility is there to check the syntax of the message in FHIR as well as it is done in V2. It is a sunken cost argument, if you argue that V2 is a choice because it is. There's no technical limitation to building tools to check FHIR syntax. Conformance is a nice in-built feature. Consider an IG. If I send a system a FHIR payload that conforms to an IG, then the system which knows the IG can handle the data and structure appropriately. A  well done CapabilityStatement (with associated IGs) includes rules around the values for each element and presence/absence as well as logic. The CapabilityStatement is the future. The CapabilityStatement sits inside a server as part of the conformance module. It can/should be a computable statement of what the server 'knows' and expects. An IG is a set of rules that can be computed.  Folks are still getting into FHIR for sure. But it has better opportunity for explicit, computable interoperability than V2  - only because the lessons of V2 have been learned (as well as CDAs).</p>",

The FHIR spec does tell a system what to expect as a response if a FHIR Server is unhappy with the payload, the spec also tells a FHIR server what it can send to tell a system about the status of a payload.
