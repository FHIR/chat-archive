I'm kinda wondering, if in trying to create a specific profile for each type of implication, are we creating confusion knowing which profile to use (e.g. when would you use the Medication Transporter implication; how does somatic predictive differ from somatic prognostic) and are we going to need even more implication profiles as we want to capture additional types of implications (e.g. variant is a risk factor, presence of a variant suggests a mis-diagnosis). I'm not sure I see why a single generic implication profile, that has a component for the type of interaction, that allows for references to medications, etc, wouldn't work.</p>",

How you express the 'signficance' of something varies depending on what was found, and sometimes it can have different categories of things to say:  In this <a href=\"https://jmd.amjpathol.org/article/S1525-1578(16)30223-9/fulltext#sec4\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://jmd.amjpathol.org/article/S1525-1578(16)30223-9/fulltext#sec4\">article</a>, which  we at least partially used to help define our somatic approach, I like this section:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Somatic variants include SNVs, indels, fusion genes resulting from genomic rearrangements, and CNVs. Unlike interpretation of germline sequence variations, which focuses on pathogenicity of a variant for a specific disease or disease causality, interpretation of somatic variants should be focused on their impact on clinical care. A variant can be considered a biomarker that affects clinical care if it predicts sensitivity, resistance, or toxicity to a specific therapy, alters the function of the gene, which can be targeted by approved or investigational drugs, serves as an inclusion criterion for clinical trials, influences disease prognosis, assists in establishing a diagnosis of a cancer, or warrants implementing surveillance measures for early cancer detection. Clinical impacts should, therefore, include therapeutic, prognostic, diagnostic, and preventive actions. The clinical impact of a given variant should be determined according to currently available evidence. Evidence used for variant categorization can be weighed differently based on its significance in clinical decision making.</p>\n</blockquote>",
