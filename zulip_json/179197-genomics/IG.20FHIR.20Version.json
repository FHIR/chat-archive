So i was wondering if we should address this issue, we could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Switch back to 4.0.0 (i think its to late for that now as publishing is currently being done)</li>\n<li>build the IG  in a 4.0.0 version and put it in the ci build to be downloaded as a zip as an alternative for now?</li>\n</ul>",
