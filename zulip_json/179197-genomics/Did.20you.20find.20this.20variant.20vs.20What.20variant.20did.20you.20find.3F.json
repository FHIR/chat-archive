So this is asking the question, \"Is this complex variant present?\" I need to ask the question \"What is the complex variant present?\" I can use this profile by always using \"Present\" in the observation.valueCodeableConcept, and putting in the HLA allele name as a component for \"Complex genetic variant code\" (81261-0). It's definitely doable and I'll use that if that's what is needed to be conformant to the IG, but that seems a bit contrived (that really isn't the question I asked). Is there any problem with me making an observation with observation.code being the \"Complex genetic variant code\" with the value being the HLA allele?  It wouldn't adhere to any of the profiles in the IG, but it would be a valid FHIR Observation.</p>\n<p>So right now, with the current Complex Variant Observation, I'm using this...</p>\n<div
