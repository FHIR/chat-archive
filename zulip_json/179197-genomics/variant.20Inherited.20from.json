        "content": "<p>The work of Nephi Walton, Clinical Geneticist at Geisenger, to map gnomic reports he is using into our IG, requires a data element for InheritanceOfVariant with values De Novo, Unknown, Father (Paternal), Mother (Maternal). The element is meant to indicate weather the variant was found in the patient's parent. This is typical reported in a TRIO analysis (where the patient's genome is compared to close relatives - typically mother and father). The reports generated from these analysis do not always provide supporting documentation. The value is simply stated as metadata that the Lab has regarding the variant. </p>\n<p>My proposal is to create a new component in our IG before publishing to accommodate the element.</p>\n<p>Looking in our IG, For sequence phase relationship(<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/obs-sequence-phase-reltn.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/obs-sequence-phase-reltn.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/obs-sequence-phase-reltn.html</a>) we use the LOINC code for Allelic Phase ( <a href=\"https://r.details.loinc.org/LOINC/82120-7.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://r.details.loinc.org/LOINC/82120-7.html\">https://r.details.loinc.org/LOINC/82120-7.html</a>) but with a required value set of cis, trans, indeterminate, unknown. This element is specifically for relating a variant observation with other variant observations. I do not think it applicable to Nephi's requirement as De Novo is not a relationship between variants.</p>\n<p>The proposed element provides a place for the lab to state whom the variation was inherited from, not the phase. </p>\n<p>Full-term name:Variant Inheritance<br>\nShorthand name: InheritanceOfVariant <br>\nDefinition: Weather or not the variant was inherited from the patient's mother or father.  <br>\nValue Set: De Novo, Uknown, Maternal, Paternal</p>\n<p>I think a component would be best as this is a property of the variant and has no meaning without being a part of an observation of a variant.</p>\n<p>The geforge tracker is: <a href=\"https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=24853\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=24853\">https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=24853</a> <br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191451\">@Patrick Werner</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192198\">@Bob Freimuth</span></p>",

De Novo (not inherited, not somatic) vs Germline (inherited) is already able to be designated in Genomic Source Class. I'm not sure what else this new concept provides that isn't in Allelic Phase. </p>\n<p>Feedback I got about the values in the existing LOINC code for Allelic Phase:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first 5 values are confusing, even to experts in the field. They were concerned users would misuse these values, or misinterpret them. The concepts of <strong>cis</strong> and <strong>trans</strong> are relational, but this is attempting to note them in a non-relational manner, which is confusing to experts in both the clinic and the lab. </li>\n<li>The remaining values (Maternal, Paternal, Unknown) relate to the <strong>inheritance</strong> of the variant. From this, the phase can easily be determined. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>My suggestion is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have one concept and LOINC code called \"Allele Inheritance\" and only include Maternal, Paternal, Unknown values.</li>\n<li>Have one relational concept/LOINC code that includes Cis and Trans values, which can be used to describe relationships between one or more variants. These values must have 2 or more variants attached to make sense.</li>\n</ol>",

We would likely want to map these values to a specific answer list, and add values that make sense as users identify reasonable additional use cases. Placing this as \"Other, please specify\" encourages use of these concepts in a way that isn't discrete, which can cause issues from a data structure/reporting perspective. It would mean that it is difficult to find all variants that were marked \"Not Paternal\" for a gene if that is a free text value rather than a codified value. </p>\n<p>That can all be changed based on the implementation decisions an individual institution makes when implementing the IG, but thought I'd bring it up in case it is relevant.</p>",
