This would mean that where overlap exists one need only look in DNA change type or AA change type. Or <em>we leave it open and acknowledge that implementers will need to be prepared to find/store data with either of the three fields</em>. Think about the query required to return all annotations, and the query to try to discover all variants where there is a DNA change.

Anyhow, I think DNA and AA change types are orthogonal to functional annotation. The former tells you just what the variant is. The latter helps you decide if the variant may be clinically relevant (e.g. because the DNA change occurs in an exon rather than in an intron).</p>",
