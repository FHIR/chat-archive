The Observation.component[].value[x] is a polymorphic element, so there is a choice of data types. You can see them here:<br>\n<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation-definitions.html#Observation.component.value_x_\">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation-definitions.html#Observation.component.value_x_</a></p>\n<p>To your second question, 'component' is a generic array of name/value pairs that can be delivered as part of a single observation, and should be used for <code>any supporting result that cannot reasonably be interpreted and used outside the scope of the Observation it is a component of.</code> In the case of our genomics reporting implementation guide, we use components to deliver 'annotations' about the concepts represented in our IG (review the <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/StructureDefinition-variant.html\">Variant</a> profile to see more). For additional background, I would recommend reading up on the entire Observation resource, then closely review 'component' and the section about grouping of observations:<br>\n<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation-definitions.html#Observation.component\">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation-definitions.html#Observation.component</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html#obsgrouping\">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html#obsgrouping</a></p>\n<p>Regarding extensions, it is a core FHIR topic that you will certainly want to read more about - this is the place to go:<br>\n<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility.html</a></p>\n<p>To compare the two, component is a 'built in' way to deliver supporting results that are specific to the Observation resource. By contrast, extensions can be made to almost anything in FHIR as needed by certain use cases. In either case, it is vital to understand the underlying principles first, then closely review how implementation guides (like Genomics Reporting) use those principles to make more standardized implementations possible.</p>",
