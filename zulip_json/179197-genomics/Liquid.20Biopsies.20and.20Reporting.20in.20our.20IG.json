I don't know where they went - however the best source for some sample Foundation reports is to go here: <a href=\"https://www.foundationmedicine.com/test/foundationone-cdx\">https://www.foundationmedicine.com/test/foundationone-cdx</a> - then scroll down to \"real world results\" and you can see PDFs of various reports...   I also added an \"overview\" document of Foundation Medicine reports in the repository which Kevin highlighted. Hope this helps</p>",
