As far as I understand it, if I have one Observation per variant I want to represent this mutation in a sequence resource  and for a complex structural mutation I would connect this observation to several sequences.<br>\nWe should also take into account that Whole Genome Sequencing can result in several thousand mutations therefore I am not sure if this is feasible.<br>\nAlso if a somatic mutation was found I want to link this to two samples a tumor sample and a control sample (mostl likely from blood) which is not possible right now, or is it? <br>\nI don't know if this is the best way to ask all these questions here of if there is a better way for me to proceed.</p>",
