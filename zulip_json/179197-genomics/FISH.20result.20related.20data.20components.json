With a codeable concept there is a display field, this is textual display to accompany the code. So if the locus has a coded representation you could use that as the code and a display string.

Or do you think the cytoband  component would work? Also, do you mean component.value-string for gene-studied? Another option to consider is using component:variation-code instead of gene-studied.  With a codeable concept there is a display field, this is textual display to accompany the code. So if the locus has a coded representation you could use that as the code and a display string. But to fully describe the locus I would suggest considering using some combination of references, chromosome, start and end components. OR codeableconcept.text by itself without a code</p>\n<p>Nice work by the way! Are you suggesting two new components cell-phase and number-cells-analyzed? You could slice component (the CG IG leaves it open) and use the LOINC codes for component.code</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For clarification, I am uploading an image of Variant Profile as named as CNV (just cuz it has copy number event on genes or locus as part of the result of FISH tests)<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/oCVkUgvFS7X7y_r87nED4NCA/스크린샷-2022-02-25-오후-1.47.55.png\">스크린샷-2022-02-25-오후-1.47.55.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/oCVkUgvFS7X7y_r87nED4NCA/스크린샷-2022-02-25-오후-1.47.55.png\" title=\"스크린샷-2022-02-25-오후-1.47.55.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/oCVkUgvFS7X7y_r87nED4NCA/스크린샷-2022-02-25-오후-1.47.55.png\"></a></div>",

I don't think I've seen one from the site. Please if you could share the component link that would be helpful!</li>\n<li>Also, do you mean component.value-string for gene-studied? -&gt; ANS: no, from what I've seen from the Variant profile page, there is conclusion-string AND gene-studied Component Elements. Gene-Studied would be used for gene names (TNF, MTHFR, and the likes) while conclusion-string would be used to share Probe Information (since you've mentioned that Probe Information can't be stored currently because there are no elements or LOINC codes to represent those information)</li>\n<li>Are you suggesting two new components cell-phase and number-cells-analyzed? -&gt; From what I've experienced (as this is my first time to work on this type of projects) I think at least in Korea, Probe information or test information is a MUST (regulation). Thus, those two information would need to be present in the profile? for FISH AND for hemato-oncology related profiles? (again, I am not expert in this field but as far as I have been told by the lab, they said it is required and is a in the regulation)</li>\n</ol>",

        "content": "<ol>\n<li>Yes, it would mean multiple profiles. Likely you'll also want to use diagnostic report, even if you do not use haplotype and genotype, so you will be likely to send more than one profile anyway. Multiple profiles allow for compartmentalization. But for the locus name, you might try the variation id component, but it depends on what you mean by locus name. If you mean something like 3p22.1 then that would go into cytogenetic-location but I think you mean something else.</li>\n<li>I meant component:cytogenetic-location it's not the cytoband label that you need. It's for position use the cytogenomic banding nomenclature (e.g. 3p22.1). From your other example, I think you want a place for 'Banding technique' like C-banding and G-banding, when you say chromosome band. This would be part of the method.</li>\n<li>Can you give me an explicit example of what you mean by locus name? </li>\n<li>Cell-phase and number-cells-analyzed are an important subset for sure. Seems reasonable to me to have them in their for FISH. But some methodology information could go into the methodology sections, take a look at the EMERGE based Pharmacogenomics report on how they handled methodology sections. <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/pharmacogenomics.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/pharmacogenomics.html</a> Take a look at how they use Plan Definition <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/plandefinition.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/plandefinition.html</a> to see how they used it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Banding type (e.g. G-banding), banded level (e.g. 450) could all be observations linked to a Diganostic report. But you showed me an example with them as components. I think that's a good move, you have the specific LOINC codes, but more importantly banded-level and banding-type are meaningless by themselves. The profiles in the CG IG are very much focused on results not attributes of the study. We have an active effort to allow for a better way to describe attributes of the study (e.g. how many cells observed). </p>\n<p>Have you had a look at diagnostic report yet? <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/StructureDefinition-genomics-report.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/StructureDefinition-genomics-report.html</a> There are fields there that you might find useful. The pattern is to use Diagnostic Report at the top level and then connect to results underneath it. Each OBX can be one observation result linked as a result to the Diagnostic Report. There is also a coded-annotation field you might find useful for some statements. Here's an example of a bundle one might send to show how things are tied back to Diagnostic Report (not cytogenetic specific): <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/Bundle-bundle-cgexample.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/Bundle-bundle-cgexample.html</a> </p>\n<p>Also, for the conclusion that the patient has a specific disease, the diagnostic implication profile would be suggested as a structured means of reproting: <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/StructureDefinition-diagnostic-implication.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/StructureDefinition-diagnostic-implication.html</a></p>",
