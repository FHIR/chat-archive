I'm trying to understand the difference between these three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>IG Package last uploaded to Simplifier on Nov 2019</li>\n<li>The current live IG (docs)</li>\n<li>What will be proposed in May</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Does (2) have content that is not in (1)? Is there someplace I can view the diff between (3) and (2)? </p>\n<p>I'm asking from the perspective of an Implementer who is interested in modeling Clinical Genomics reports. But I'm interested in theoretical considerations as well.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much!</p>",

There is not a specific diff page yet. However, some highlights are: consolidation in the pharmacogenomics space with medication-Transporter, medication-High-Risk, medication-Metabolism and medication-Efficacy begin moved to components in Therapeutic Implication. New Operation: $find-subject-variants    <br>\nRetrieves variants from a specified genomic region.
