For the most part, we have been using Haplotype/Genotype more as a container to ultimately represent a list of Variants, which is where you would find the refSeq and locations. However, perhaps that is not always appropriate.</p>\n<p>I can't get to the full article. Do you mind presenting more detail on how you think we should represent haplotypes and genotypes in this use case? Are you thinking about adding some combination of genomic-ref-seq, coordinate-system, chromosome-identifer, exact-start-end, inner-start-end, outer-start-end that are on Variant to Haplotype and Genotype?</p>\n<p>And sorry if this is a dumb question, but could you represent the intergenic variant(s) with the Variant profile, then group them with  Haplotype and/or Genotype?</p>\n<p>Once again, I think you are on the edges or even a bit outside of what we were intending to support <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
