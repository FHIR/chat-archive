I'd like get back to the OMOP/OHDSI team this week on day for Christian Reich (OHDSI) to present on the  OMOP Genomics model? From one of our meeting minutes, I recall that one of the Tuesdays in February will work.  Feb 9, 16, 23?  Let me know which day is best for the WG and I'll notify Christian.  Thanks!</p>",
