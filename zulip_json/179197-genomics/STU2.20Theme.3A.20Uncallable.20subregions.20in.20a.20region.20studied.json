We've been experimenting with a new component 'no call region', on the region-studied profile. With this component, in response to a query for variants in a given region, a server can provide a report that also enumerates non-callable subregions, potentially enabling one to differentiate non-callable vs. true negatives. The main use case we based this on was the need to include wildtype variant calls for PharmGKB's PharmCAT (<a href=\"https://github.com/PharmGKB/PharmCAT\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/PharmGKB/PharmCAT\">https://github.com/PharmGKB/PharmCAT</a>) software. </p>\n<p>The example is a set of variants found for 1000 Genomes patient HG00403, that also include non-callable subregions. (It's based on a slightly outdated pre-publication version of the IG).</p>",

I think they are closely related, in that depth of coverage is a major determinant of whether or not a region is deemed callable.  My understanding is that different labs may have different parameters for determining when a region is callable, not solely based on depth of coverage. Also, while, for instance 30x-50x coverage is good for WGS, it might be considered inadequate for WES or targeted gene sequencing - so depth of coverage in and of itself doesn't directly equate with callability.</p>",
