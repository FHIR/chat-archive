Nothing wrong with that, as long as this is clearly stated and understood.  I also feel that it is important to be sure we focus on the \"moped\" version of the IG first.  Bob - am I correct in thinking that your desire for this information comes from your VCF translator and and/or development of a GACS?  If so - those are excellent use cases - but not the current focus of our IG (at least as I understand it). Unless there is a clear way to \"point to this data\" - e.g. through an endpoint or find a set of resuable data hosted somewhere that could be utilized. I have other thoughts, but I think it would be best to have a discussion about this (outside of a normal meeting ) to brainstorm.</p>",
