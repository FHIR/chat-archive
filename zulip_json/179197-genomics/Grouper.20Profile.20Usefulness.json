In a flat DiagnosticReport, those Observations could end up structured like this..</p>\n<p>DiagnosticReport<br>\n|--result<br>\n....|--Variant 1<br>\n|--result<br>\n....|--Haplotype 1 (derived from Variant 1)<br>\n|--result<br>\n....|--Haplotype 3 (derived from Variant 3)<br>\n|--result<br>\n....|--Diagnostic Implication 2 (derived from Variant 2)<br>\n|--result<br>\n....|--Variant 2<br>\n|--etc</p>\n<p>This structure is possibly needlessly scrambled, but there is no order requirement for diagnostic reports, so systems should be able to handle this “scrambled” report the same way as one that might have the results “in the right order” – or at least an order that makes more sense to humans.<br>\nIf we were to recommend the use of groupers, we could have reports that look like this:<br>\nDiagnosticReport<br>\n|--result<br>\n....|--Group 1<br>\n........|--HasMember Reference to Haplotype 1 (derived from Variant 1)<br>\n........|--HasMember Reference to Variant 1<br>\n........|--HasMember Reference to Diagnostic Implication 1 (derived from Variant 1)<br>\n|--result<br>\n....|--Group 3 <br>\n|--result<br>\n....|--Group 2<br>\n |--etc.</p>\n<p>In this structure, data can still be scrambled, but is more organized. Notably, this organization is intended to create a group composed of a variant and any other Observations “derivedFrom” or logically associated with that variant. Each non-variant Observation would need to contain some way of communicating this relationship (likely with a reference back to the original Observation variant), but this should still allow each Observation to stand on its own. I would think this would be useful for any situation where other Observations besides the variant is being reported.</p>\n<p>Is there a reason we are not recommending data be represented this way and instead kind of leaving it open? </p>\n<p>Additionally, would there be a problem if we were to represent the data in the second format? </p>\n<p>Tagging Rachel and Dan to keep them in the loop <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"249407\">@Rachel Kutner</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194329\">@Daniel Rutz</span></p>",

So you are proposing to use the Grouper profile to group together all observations related to a variant? We have tossed around several ideas for Grouper so far but not sure we had considered that one. To date we feel like it will likely be a useful we just haven’t decided the right way to leverage it. Other ideas so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sections of the report </li>\n<li>panels of the test</li>\n<li>features like ‘gene’<br>\nThe section and panel ideas might likely be solved better by the introduction of a Composition attribute on Diagnostic report that would allow the expression of structure on a report and its results.  However grouping by Variant is close to the feature grouping I had mentioned. It is probably an idea worth exploring. <br>\nAnd as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194329\">@Daniel Rutz</span> points out, this has always felt like something that could be more generally applicable.

I'm not saying that needs to be its only use, but it feels like it'd be useful from a processing standpoint. I've been told we might see ~100 variants on some complicated genomic reports. If each of them has one associated haplotype and one associated diagnostic implication, that quickly becomes 300 Observations (despite there possibly being even more associated Observations). From a software perspective, that feels worrisome - if an Observation I'm trying to format references another Observation I haven't processed yet (due to weird ordering shenanigans). </p>\n<p>I also think conceptually, it makes some sense. The \"result\" of a lab test for genomics conceptually seems to more be the literal finding in the variant + the incidental findings and implications.

The Grouper piece would have a reference to haplotype 1, diagnostic implication 1, and variant 1. Variant 1 would stand on its own, and Haplotype 1 / Diagnostic Implication 1 would have a reference to Variant 1 through their \"derivedFrom\" properties. This way we essentially end up having an organizational structure that groups \"everything known about and because of variant 1\" - which I've also been calling the \"result\" - that whole piece together. We also still communicate that \"we know about haplotype 1 because of variant 1\" without having to rely on the grouper. </p>\n<p>2) From a relational database standpoint, processing the links last seems costly especially as the number of flattened elements increases. <br>\nEx: I have 10 therapeutic implications - each of which was determined because of 1 (or more) variants (aka derivedFrom). In order to process the relational components last, I might need to pause processing a therapuetic implication as soon as I see it is derivedFrom something - which would likely require holding on to some part of it in memory. I think this gets worse as more things are derived from a given variant and as more complex relationships pop up. It might be that the observations with no relationships should be processed first, but then I would think you might end up sifting through all sent observations to find the terminal ones - then you might need to iterated back over your list to see what can now be processed.  </p>\n<p>I will note that for groupers, you probably would still probably want to process the relational pieces last, but if we could set the groupers up to group what generally is related, I think it becomes a little easier to break the original list into groups of smaller things you could check for relationships between - if that makes sense</p>",

You could even say that groupers just end up adding an extra reference. That being said, even if they end up increasing some sort of resolution chain length, I don't think they complicate the underlying technical issue. However, structuring data that way may make resolving some pieces of that easier down the road especially if we can make some assumptions / recommendations. (This is in addition to just the organizational benefits I was initially talking about). </p>\n<p>It sounds like you've thought about this a bit, so I'd be interested in whether you have some sort of planned system?</p>\n<p>But an example assumption I would want to try to make is that for a gropuer, each member is resolvable to the same FHIR server. Now, there's nothing that guarantees this, and you could probably code a general solution, but 90% of the time, I would think it's reasonable for a literal observation and a derived observation to be represented in the same system. </p>\n<p>In the scenario where the processor needs to resolve other references, this would at the least help with making fewer requests to other servers. You can do a search on _id=&lt;grouperID&gt;&amp;_include=Observation:hasMember. There's a chance that a really smart processor could compile a list of which references are on the same server / have a similar base URL, but that seems a bit risky to me.</p>\n<p>In the scenario where all references are local (either sent in the bundle or somehow already on the server) each of the pieces is logically now a lot more separable. By construction, the grouper I'm talking about should contain its interrelated observations. Then, all the diagnostic report processing might look like is whether each of the groupers is a full grouper - as opposed to whether each of the included Observations has each of its references. There'd also need to be some validation in the end, but the overall possible options of which references can interrelate should decrease.</p>",

My takeaway from that was that the best way to return data was that if category = genomics/genetics (there's another JIRA for that), then we return all of the Observations that inherit from the base genomics profile. From there, you can key in by specifying code or the like on other pieces.</p>\n<p>So you could do something like this:<br>\nObservation?patient=&lt;patient&gt;&amp;category=genomics&amp;code=grouper -&gt; to get all of the groupers (last I checked, the grouper code was the tbd code for the grouper profile)</p>\n<p>The query piece that I was referring to in my previous message was that if a third party were to try to get their data to show up on a FHIR server in any of the pictured formats, that the more options you have for how things could be linked, the more tangled the resolution becomes.

I can put in two examples. </p>\n<p>E.g. give me the panel of connected results - hopefully the right observsation.code has been used for the Panel observation that is using has member. So you just ask for all the members of the panel (follow has members link). You'd not be able to do that with our grouper profile. </p>\n<p>E.g. give me all the profiles linked to the genotype (or haplotype or whatever), follow the links in the profiles with the query iteratively - we've some examples of that now.</p>",

The above example could just have a group for each variant.  </li>\n<li>The above raises the question - should grouping / groupers be allowed for single observations? It looks like it is for figure 2. </li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We are calling out that FHIR Observation allows for a variety of grouping options, and wanted to provide some examples of what implementers should expect. And yes, groupings of a single observation would be allowed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>For 1.7.2 - does O&amp;O recommend using the summaryOf extension to represent subsets of DiagnosticReports? If so, what is supposed to be on the highest level of the DiagnosticReport.results? </li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The current R4 definition of <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extension-diagnosticreport-summaryof.html\">summaryOf</a> is honestly pretty light: \"A summary report that points to subordinate target reports.\" To me, each report (top level or subordinate) should follow the guidance we provide here. I would probably have to refer you to O&amp;O for more concrete guidance on that one though.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>I don't think we should say \"if a lab were to not follow good practice and send only grouping observations as results for report\" - if we're not making a determination on groupers/grouping, we can't really recommend that it's against best practice to send some non-grouped observations</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I want to hear from others on this one, but it's not that we are \"not making a determination on groupers/grouping\" - we are \"not currently constraining what sort of grouping is allowed\" - meaning our determination on groupers/grouping as of now is to allow the base Observation features to cover this for us.<br>\nI am personally fine with providing the guidance that the best practice is to reference all Observations from the report for the reasons listed.</p>",

The genetic findings, implications and region studied profiles all contain links to computably define their composite relationships (e.g. the variant observation is referenced within the implication profile using derivedFrom). Also, the observations could be organized into groups by other observations. See this grouping guidance for an overview with examples and considerations for processing reports.</p>",
