I was hoping to get some clarification on how one would align the answer lists of both codes (69548-6 and 50956-2) as it relates to the valueCodeableConcept.  The Genetic variant assessment (69548-6) has answer list LL1971-2 which has present/absent/on call/indeterminate whereas the alternate LOINC code for the <code>HLA-B*57:01</code> has the answer list LL360-9 which is positive/negative.  The valueCodeableConcept aligns with the primary code (69548-6) as \"Present\" but wouldn't this misalign with the answers for what we really want to answer which is the interpretation for <code>HLA-B*57-01</code>?   Would it be possible to enhance this example so that for every alternate code there is an equivalent alternate <code>valueCodeableConcept</code>?  I'm still very new to Clinical Genomics so anything that helps me understand this better would be helpful.</p>",
