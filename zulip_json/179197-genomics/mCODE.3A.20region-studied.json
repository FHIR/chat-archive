As a general question, in the CG Reporting IG, is there a reason why region-studied was made an Observation when the general guidance for an observation is that there is a result?  Moreover, why is region-studied a result in itself as opposed to just some supporting information about the test?  On a related note, how would we tie the variant to region-studied if there are multiple regions (0..*)?  Is it anticipated that this is inferred from the variant HGVS?

But, defining the methodology details is an area of interest to improve.</p>\n<p>I don't think we envisioned making a relationship between the variant and a region-studied.  There should be enough details on the variant to describe its location.  I would hope that the sender of data would not ONLY share this via HGVS for many of the reasons discussed on the other threads here recently.</p>",

I suppose that pragmatically makes sense, although it seems a bit out of line with the intent for an Observation.  We can consider documenting the inference of a region studied based supporting attributes in the Variant profile.  I can bring it back to the mCODE team and let the team know on the CG Monday call.</p>",
