The best way to describe them maybe to say that if a receiving system were to ignore an extension the information would still be valid (i.e. the extension could be removed form the data instance - message - and the information would still be correct/complete). An example extension might be a field such as 'human readable drug name' in a data instance about a Medication. The extension is computable from the other fields in the data instance (product, dose etc). The absence of the extension 'human readable drug name' would not  remove essential information.</p>",
