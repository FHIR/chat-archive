For instance, this example [http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/Bundle-oncology-report-example.html] includes a variant for FBXW7 (NM_001349798.2:c.1394G&gt;A). Presumably this is a NGS test, where a genomic variant was detected. The FBXW7 gene has multiple transcripts. Why did the lab specifically show this c.HGVS and p.HGVS?</p>",
