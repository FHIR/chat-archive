The approved symbol changes from time to time and there are examples where different genes share a symbol as a synonym. Even with the potential for indicating the wrong gene, people will still often use the gene symbol.</p>\n<p>But for a true identifier that is guaranteed to point to one specific gene, use the code (such as HGNC: 4931). </p>\n<p>If needed, I am sure the folks at HGNC would be willing to comment and affirm the above.

Here's their response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As previously written officially the gene ID should have HGNC: as a prefix however it is not necessary to use the prefix to link to the page in the URL. I urge you to use the HGNC: however as this does identify the ID as a HGNC gene ID without having to associate it with the URL. Our beta site will be replacing the current site in November and as default the URL will have the prefix HGNC: (e.g <a href=\"https://beta.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/HGNC:1097\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://beta.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/HGNC:1097\">https://beta.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/HGNC:1097</a>) as standard (however again it will work if the HGNC: is dropped).</p>\n<p>We do have other numerical IDs within the HGNC site that are unique identifiers for the gene family/group records (<a href=\"https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/genefamilies/set/654\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/genefamilies/set/654\">https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/genefamilies/set/654</a>). Here the ID does not have a prefix so using HGNC: for the gene records helps to clearly identify one as a gene ID and the other as a family/group. We also have a sister site called the VGNC that names vertebrate genes. If in future we decide to merge the two sites into one, the prefix will be important to distinguish a human gene ID from a vertebrate gene ID.</p>\n<p>By using the prefix we are also following on with the tradition within nomenclature committees in adding a prefix for the resource as part of the ID as the same style of ID can be seen within the Mouse (<a href=\"http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:88190\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:88190\">http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:88190</a>) and Rat (<a href=\"https://rgd.mcw.edu/rgdweb/report/gene/main.html?id=RGD:619908\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://rgd.mcw.edu/rgdweb/report/gene/main.html?id=RGD:619908\">https://rgd.mcw.edu/rgdweb/report/gene/main.html?id=RGD:619908</a>) nomenclature resources.</p>\n</blockquote>",
