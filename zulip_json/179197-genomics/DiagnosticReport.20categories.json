The issue we grappled with was focused on <a href=\"http://genenames.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://genenames.org\">genenames.org</a> and that gene names had a HGNC: prefix but gene groups do not. e.g., 588 - Histocompatibility complex, HLA) , vs HGNC:588 (ATG12, autophagy related 12). The issue that we recognized many systems don't capture the prefix, and may confuse the gene with gene group. The consensus, as I remember it, was to create two different namespace (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.genenames.org/hgnc\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.genenames.org/hgnc\">https://www.genenames.org/hgnc</a> vs <a href=\"https://www.genenames.org/genegroup\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.genenames.org/genegroup\">https://www.genenames.org/genegroup</a>).  Until the namespaces are resolved, we continue to use <a href=\"http://genenames.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://genenames.org\">genenames.org</a> for both with clear wording about the differences between gene-names and gene-groups. I want to use a gene-group id as an additional coding for the master panel code we use in DR.code</p>",
