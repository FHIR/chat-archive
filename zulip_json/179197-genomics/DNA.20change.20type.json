        "content": "<p>Adding the question here: There was good discussion and contribution from many folks last week. With regards to the value set for DNA change type, I think we should reconsider the value set from LOINC codes that we offer. Sequence Ontology is an ontology for the specific concepts we would want to use here. In general, LOINC answer lists are examples to provide a better understanding of the LOINC code which refers to the answer list. Given that SO's purview is molecular concepts for DNA/RNA and amino acids, it is likely that SO will remain ahead of LOINC, in terms of completeness of the concepts used as values for the LOINC term. I recommend we take another look at SO versus LA codes here. I can't recall the specific argument to use LA codes in our value set. But , if we use a value set of SO terms and mark the value element with 'extensible,' we will guide systems into using SO and allow for systems that use LA codes.  To sum up, I think we should consider changing the value set for the component 'DNA change type' to SO with the value set as extensible (<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/obs-variant-definitions.html#Observation.component:dna-chg-type\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/obs-variant-definitions.html#Observation.component:dna-chg-type\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/obs-variant-definitions.html#Observation.component:dna-chg-type</a>). Anyone agree? Thoughts? Comments?</p>",
