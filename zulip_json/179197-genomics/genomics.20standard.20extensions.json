For several of those listed (e.g.: observation-geneticsGenomicSourceClass, observation-geneticsGene) we now represent them as components rather than extensions (which I suspect was what we originally had in the original DSTU2 version). This presents an ambiguous guidance for the same elements represented as both allowable standard extensions and components. It could be confusing for implementers.<br>\n<strong>Question:</strong> should we keep these as standard extensions? Or should we work with FHIR-I to deprecate them once the CG Reporting IG v1.1 is published?</p>",
