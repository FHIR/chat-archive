I think of Sequence like this: It represents the Sequence data, but it has a variety of ways that it can represent the sequence such that a consumer should be able to create it.  To answer your question about \"mutations\" - given a reference sequence, and list of a variants, someone should be able to take that reference, apply the variants, and come up with the sequence.

The issue is our ability to propagate data to (and more importantly through) systems that are not going to be designed with genetics in mind.  If you imagine data coming from genomic specific software and then propagating information into a lab's generic reporting software, then sent as a diagnostic report to an EHR, then uploaded into a patient's Apple phone, then downloaded into another EHR where it'll be looked at by someone like Bob Dollin, then made available to a genetics-aware decision support system, what are the chances the decision support system is going to have the data it needs in each of the two scenarios: all data is represented using (bulkier) Observations or all data is represented using the more concise Sequence?  </p>\n<p>I think the answer is clear that data propagation is much more likely to be successful using Observations.

It's certainly true that the existence of resources might entice some system developers to enhance the capabilities of their systems to support a resource.  But the typical pattern is that systems simply expose the data they already have and manage using the resource appropriate to that type of data.  As a result, I expect we'll only see most systems surfacing support for the Sequence (and RiskAssessment and other more essoteric resources) if they already have a specific interest in and support for those concepts as distinct notions in their systems.  Introducing a net new resource is considerably more work - and, at in most cases, will at best happen after the low-hanging fruit of \"already supported\" concepts has been addressed and will be subject to a financial business case assessment.</p>",
