This is a very valuable document you created!  I really appreciate your taking the time to do this. It helps me personally keep track of what is published where - but more importantly, we can link people to it, when they are trying to navigate various versions of our IG.</p>",

I did post a topic but thought it wasn't the right place to ask so I marked it solved (couldn't find the delete function). <br>\nyour guide should help clear confusions on the versions and help implementors to look at the correct version! <span aria-label=\"+1\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f44d\" role=\"img\" title=\"+1\">:+1:</span></p>",
