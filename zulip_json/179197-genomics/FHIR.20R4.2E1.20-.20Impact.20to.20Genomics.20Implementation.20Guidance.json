Couple of things come to mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quickly discussed making changes to the Genomics Implementation Guidance page to more clearly refer to our IG.  The proposed changes are here: <a href=\"http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-27159\">J#27159</a>.  Does that seem like something that could be included?</li>\n<li>We did remove all of the outdated genomic FHIR profiles, extensions, examples.  Is it possible to include that change in 4.1?</li>\n</ul>",
