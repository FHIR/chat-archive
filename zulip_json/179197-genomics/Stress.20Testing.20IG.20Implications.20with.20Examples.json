Implementations should use the code systems most typically used in their jurisdictions or that are mandated by national FHIR profiles.

So I will formalize it again: We are trying to validate that there is sufficient context within  the IG's  current  diagnostic/therapeutic components to represent an associated phenotype/cancer as  \"therapeutic\", without needing to explicitly flag it  as being in the \"therapeutic\" context vs \"diagnostic\" context.  If the answer is no, then we need to address this in some way to allow for this specificity.   Rachel - I agree with Kevin that the issue re: molecular-based diagnostic reports is a separate question, and that unless there is an urgent need, that should become follow-on work that that Working Group will deal with later. However the first issue does need to be clarified now, based on the input of the Oncologists I have been in contact with.   Thanks to all!</p>",

Our implications can or might not indicate a relationship to those.

But consider a condition that is not on the patients list - would not the receiving system be responsible for noting and doing something with it?</p>",

One proposal is to have components differentiate based on semantic context - i.e., one component on diagnostic imp for the concept of a 'potentially implied condition', two components on therapeutic: 1 for an 'at-risk condition' (e.g. predicted complications) and another for 'contextual condition' (able to link a cancer type or other indicated phenotype to a possible treatment)</p>",
