        "content": "<p>Is there a method to how the system and codes are defined for the various codings in the genomics profile components?</p>\n<p>I noticed that the <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/valueset-hgnc.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/valueset-hgnc.html\">HGNC Value Set section</a> the following information is provided...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This value set includes codes from the following code systems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include all codes defined in <a href=\"http://www.genenames.org/geneId\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.genenames.org/geneId\">http://www.genenames.org/geneId</a></li>\n<li>Include all codes defined in <a href=\"http://www.genenames.org/genegroup\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.genenames.org/genegroup\">http://www.genenames.org/genegroup</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is some standards evolving for working with URLs and URIs for coding systems. <a href=\"http://identifiers.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://identifiers.org/\">Identifiers.org Central Registry</a> is a service that seems to be getting quite popular and has a considerable number of the most popular coding and identifier authorities registered. It provides the ability to uniformly represent the precise code systems needed by many of the terms used in HL7.  This may be a really nice place to minimally verify that the choices made by hl7 value sets and terminology folks are similar in how they breakdown namespaces and reference the actual resources URL pattern as well as providing an <a href=\"http://Identifers.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Identifers.org\">Identifers.org</a> Compact URL.  From these two URLs a \"system\" could be consistently taken by separating out the \"code\" or \"identifier\" at the end of the URL.</p>\n<p>For example, if you <a href=\"https://registry.identifiers.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://registry.identifiers.org/\">search the registry</a> by typeing in \"HGNC\" in the search box you will notice that four results return </p>\n<ul>\n<li>hgnc</li>\n<li>hgnc.symbol</li>\n<li>hgnc.family</li>\n<li>hgnc.genefamily</li>\n</ul>\n<p>these four separate and distinct hgnc code systems have there own compact url (or namespace). I believe hgnc.genefamily is equivalent to the \"genegroup\" in the value set description above and \"hgnc\" is the one that would align with the geneId.</p>\n<p>if you drill into the \"hgnc\" namespace you can see the details of that registered namespace. At the bottom of the screen is the Primary resource as registered by EBI (in this case). </p>\n<p>Here's the section from the bottom of the HGNC registered identifier system</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Name   HUGO Genome Nomenclature Committee<br>\nDescription    HUGO Genome Nomenclature Committee<br>\nURL Pattern    <a href=\"https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/{$id}\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/{$id}\">https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/{$id}</a><br>\nHome URL   <a href=\"https://www.genenames.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.genenames.org\">https://www.genenames.org</a><br>\nLocation   United Kingdom<br>\nSample ID (LUI)    2674</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you need to parse out the \"system\" from the \"code\" I would take the URL Pattern above and remove the \"id\" and presume that is the code value.</p>\n<p>So you would end up with </p>\n<ul>\n<li>HGNC gene id (hgnc)<ul>\n<li>system = <a href=\"https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/\">https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/</a></li>\n<li>code (ex.) = 2674 . (you could even reference the regex expression used to validate content here ^\\d{1,5}$, might be nice for implementers)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you were to follow through with the other HGNC namespaces for completeness you'd end up with </p>\n<ul>\n<li>HGNC gene symbol (hgnc.symbol)<ul>\n<li>system = <a href=\"https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/gene_symbol_report?match=\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/gene_symbol_report?match=\">https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/gene_symbol_report?match=</a></li>\n<li>code (ex.) = DAPK1 . (validation regex  ^[A-Za-z-0-9_]+(\\@)?$)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>HGNC family (hgnc.family)<ul>\n<li>system = <a href=\"https://www.genenames.org/genefamilies/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.genenames.org/genefamilies/\">https://www.genenames.org/genefamilies/</a></li>\n<li>code (ex.) = PADI .

(validation regex ^\\d+$)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>this central and emerging standardization for capturing coding/identifier systems seems like a great place to provide insights on developing more consistent and potentially reusable systems for many Codings.</p>\n<p>BTW <a href=\"http://www.genenames.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.genenames.org\">www.genenames.org</a> is the home url for the HGNC website.  I'm not sure who identified or manufactured the <a href=\"http://www.genenames.org/geneId\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.genenames.org/geneId\">www.genenames.org/geneId</a> and <a href=\"http://www.genenames.org/genegroup\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.genenames.org/genegroup\">www.genenames.org/genegroup</a> systems, but I would say that they are not super clean in that they may get confused with the actual breakdown in concepts provided by the authorizing agency.</p>\n<p>the emerge project intends to use the systems derived from the <a href=\"http://identifiers.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://identifiers.org\">identifiers.org</a> registry when available. Please let us know if this is inappropriate or invalid. if so, also let us know why so we can determine how to best standardize the values we use for \"system\"s and \"code\"s.</p>",

I think the compact identifier is useful for some non FHIR/ less structured approaches to have a notation of <code>hgnc.family:PADI</code>for v2 or other less structured standards. In FHIR we don't need such a compact identifier. We have a Codings which take care of coded values with canonical urls, ValueSets etc.</p>\n<p>What concerns me of <a href=\"http://Identifiers.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Identifiers.org\">Identifiers.org</a> is that they are duplicating parts of other terminologies and aren't always in sync. E.g. HGNC gene families are called groups for some time now, <a href=\"http://Identifier.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Identifier.org\">Identifier.org</a> still refers to them as families.<br>\n<a href=\"http://Identifier.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Identifier.org\">Identifier.org</a> also uses only the symbol of gene groups: hgnc.family:PADI, which originally is the approved Symbol of the Gene Group: Peptidyl arginine deiminases (PADI) which has the HGNC group id: 677 (<a href=\"https://www.genenames.org/data/genegroup/#!/group/677\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.genenames.org/data/genegroup/#!/group/677\">https://www.genenames.org/data/genegroup/#!/group/677</a>)</p>",
