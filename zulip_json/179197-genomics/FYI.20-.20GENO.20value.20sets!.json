Matt Brush from Monarch Initiative at OHSU worked on this with others including the ClinGen experts to develop these terms that fall outside of Sequence Ontology yet are pretty essential to this space. They certainly filled some critical gaps for defining genotypes and inheritance patterns.</p>\n<p>Here's the mapping of these value sets with those we defined in ClinGen to inform the GENO work (along with a note on a forthcoming Chromosome ontology to provide chromosome identifiers for all organisms - seems like a smart approach for a standard to consider).</p>\n<p>Phase Set . </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/interpretation/terminologies/AllelicPhaseValueSet.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/interpretation/terminologies/AllelicPhaseValueSet.html\">ClinGen allelic phase value set </a> maps to GENO terms <a href=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/geno/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FGENO_0000886\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/geno/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FGENO_0000886\">here</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Allelic State</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/interpretation/terminologies/AllelicStateValueSet.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/interpretation/terminologies/AllelicStateValueSet.html\">ClinGen allelic state value set </a> maps to a <strong>subset</strong> of the GENO terms <a href=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/geno/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FGENO_0000875\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/geno/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FGENO_0000875\">here</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Genomic source (aka Allele Origin)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/interpretation/terminologies/AlleleOriginValueSet.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/interpretation/terminologies/AlleleOriginValueSet.html\">ClinGen allele origin value set </a> maps to the GENO terms <a href=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/geno/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FGENO_0000877\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/geno/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FGENO_0000877\">here</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Chromsome Ontology (coming very soon!)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that we are working on a chromosome ontology that will provider terms for the new Chromosome Value Set I see in your documentation (reference to ClinGen value set).
