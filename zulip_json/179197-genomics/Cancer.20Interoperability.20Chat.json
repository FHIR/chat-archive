MITRE is supporting ASCO in this endeavor by translating their defined minimal list of elements into a FHIR logical model and profiles, supporting an ASCO-defined use case for an EHR which includes processing somatic and germline mutation results.  The definition and prioritization of model elements are driven by the ASCO and CancerLinQ.  Alternatively, Richard's work with RSNA/ACR is focused on radiology elements and although the HL7 CI team has started some dialogue trying to introduce genomics, there is no clear use case on how it would be used.  We hope some of the mCODE model will be merged holistically with other HL7 Cancer Interoperability work at some point, however given our separate stakeholders, use cases, and IG delivery timelines for mCODE, we don't anticipate an IG convergence between both projects anytime soon.  cc'ing <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191447\">@Mark Kramer</span> to further comment if needed.</p>",

Our first shareable draft of the mCODE IG (including our minimally cherry-picked elements from the CG R4 Genomics Reporting IG) should be available for review mid-to-late next week so I hope to get some time on the calendar to go over it with the team during one of the CGWG weekly calls or perhaps during one of the CG quarters at the HL7 WGM in Montreal?  I plan on attending so perhaps that might be a good venue.</p>",

Just out of curiosity, what is the relationship to the FHIR breast cancer IG? It seems there are a number of similar but not quite the same profiles. Are there plans to reconcile?</p>",
