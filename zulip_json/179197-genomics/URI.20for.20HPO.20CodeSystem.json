Also, the people already using HPO will be familiar with these. Thoughts?</p>",

The context is Alejandro and I (who work together) went looking for a suitable HPO codesystem URI a few months back - and I looked through various docs but only found as you say, OIDS. When I saw the one URI assigned in the spreadsheet yesterday - I just didn't know if that had been assigned a long time ago or was a wip. <br>\nI guess our argument is that inherent to OWL based ontologies is a xml:base URI that the OWL file itself defines - which seems to be a suitable candidate for code system URIS.</p>",
