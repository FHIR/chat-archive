Can you give an example where you're thinking of using it?</p>\n<p>2 Not sure what you mean exactly. A lot depends on your starting point and end point (which I think is FHIR). But if you mean template based on the type of variation, that sounds like a great start. You could break the data further into two types for a genetic result: the ephemeral interpretation/implications (useful in context) and genetic variation observation. That is, model the positional information on the variation observed separately from things like disease pathogenicity (which is what I think you're doing). And recall that things like genetic variant position data is not typically natively stored in most Healthcare LIS today. The specification accommodates current modes of communication and extends to a more robust representation. The report representation data elements should be mappable into FHIR structures - if you find something that does not appear to be, please mention it. </p>\n<p>1 DSTU2 is coming out soon, currently viewable and under QA here <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/</a> In DSTU2 have a look at <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/StructureDefinition-diagnostic-implication.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/StructureDefinition-diagnostic-implication.html</a> </p>\n<p>I think you're on the right track, have a look at the examples in the build, we've added more.<br>\nAnd when looking at the FHIR profiles be sure to look at both the Snapshot table and the Differential table. The use of some abstract profiles means that there are elements that are not seen in the Differential table. The Snapshot table includes everything the profile could have.</p>\n<p>With FHIR one does have enough space to do weird things technically (things that don't make sense, like using cardinality '0..x' to interpret that one can send a basically empty profile), but hopefully the space is tamed somewhat by the IGs.</p>",

Below is an example process.<br>\nEXAMPLE : <br>\nthe API is given data that represents a result of RNF213 gene, R4810K mutation lab test, the API must decide how to build a Diagnostic Report with all the necessary reference resources. So for this particular test, it is a “germline” based on sequencing test method. If the test result is “DETECTED”, then it would create observed variants (Variant Profile) to express test result data (GeneId, Exon#, Nucleotide change, amino acid change, maybe chromosomal locus, maybe target reference [NM_…]). Then it would need to create Observation Interpretation (Overall Interpretation Profile) to express in higher level whether variant was detected or not.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, like the above process in building a diagnostic report for one test, you have many other tests (I can’t confidently say what types due to my lack of understanding but like the variants or Fragile-X tests, LHON, Prader-Willi, QF PCR, ABO genotyping, NF1, BRCA1, Huntington Disease to name a few). These tests all could have different elements or profiles to represent test results… for example ABO genotyping would use Genotype Profile instead of Variant profile to express results, some test might express interpretation as present/absent and some might express as detected/not-detected..<br>\nAs an implementer and a developer, I wanted to sort of create a template for similar tests so that I wouldn’t have to go through all test names and have overlapping source code repeated (like apply factory method pattern for creating said resources depending on a higher level category of test).</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Due to my inexperience and expertise I basically base of my analysis on examples of different profiles provided in the guide. Based on the examples, I’ve only seen Presence, Absence codes from LOINC as answers for interpretation or the observation resource itself. However, there are certain tests that express the presence or absence of a variant/result differently, like RNF213 gene, R4810K mutation test . The said example test reports w/ observed variant  as SNV with GeneId (RNF213) , Nucleotide Change (Genomic Dna Chnage in FHIR) , Amino Acid Change, Zygosity, and Exon #. However, instead of reporting as present/absent interpretation the lab would like to express these as detected/not-detected. I am pretty sure there are codes out there in LOINC (since loinc is used) but I am very cautious in picking any because loinc codes can mean world apart even if the said display names are the same. Is there any because I’ve tried searching directly from <a href=\"http://loinc.org\">loinc.org</a> but failed :(.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
