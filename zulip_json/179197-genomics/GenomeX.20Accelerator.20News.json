We now have access to a number of labs, and we feel certain that some of them will become members of the Accelerator. Epic has committed to becoming a member, as has Pfizer (who has some interesting use cases). Within the next couple of weeks we will begin to send out press releases, etc. announcing GenomeX, the beginning of going very wide publicly. I had previously referred to our current stage as a \"soft opening\" - now we are moving to a full, \"hard\" opening.</p>",
