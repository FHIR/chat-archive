Then have the other results that have \"idem\" in it have the main stem resource as hasMember? to group them logically. Would this also be a good approach?</p>\n<p>Also, some results also have things like a -karyotype or a +karyotype after the main stem karyotype ( {Main Karyotype} , {-part section of main karyotype then second karyotype}, {+some other Karyotype} )... it seems like ISCN is trying to simplify the Karyotype results with words like \"idem\" or \"- / + \" but I can't seem to find a way to express these types of result in FHIR :( <br>\nI can't seem to logically connect between them.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
