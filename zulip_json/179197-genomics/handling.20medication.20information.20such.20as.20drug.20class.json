This need not be a required field.\" This is a single reference to an existing profile, or a component which contains the reference. This allows better clarification of the medication grouping, when used, and is in line with data currently sent in PGx reports. Our IG is universal. The scope of the addition to the IG would be small and the work minimal - adding a reference for medication knowledge resource as a means to communicate drug class. The divinci groups adoption of the resource is evidence of a spreading value/acceptance of the resource. Seems pretty straightforward. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32715\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32715</a> <br>\nMORE DETAILS</p>\n<p>Drug classification is an important but additional piece of information about a medication. There are several sources of classification, which source is being used can be defined using a classic code data type. The information appears with medications. <br>\nFor example, in reports from Coriell a drug classification is used to group medications together. But one would need to treat the data like any other coded value. Again I recommend working closely with the HL7 Pharmacy teams. </p>\n<p>Revised proposal follows:<br>\nFrom<br>\nMedicationKnowledge - FHIR v4.0.1 (<a href=\"http://hl7.org\">hl7.org</a>)</p>\n<p>medicineClassification  0..*    BackboneElement Categorization of the medication within a formulary or classification system<br>\ntype    1..1    CodeableConcept The type of category for the medication (for example, therapeutic classification, therapeutic sub-classification)<br>\nclassification  0..*    CodeableConcept Specific category assigned to the medication<br>\nThe divinci group has included it in a formulary resource: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-drug-formulary/\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-drug-formulary/</a>  mapped to medicationknowledge.medicineClassification</p>\n<p>Medication Classification can be found on <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medicationknowledge.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medicationknowledge.html</a>. The proposal is that our IG use the medicationknwowledge resource to provide the medicineClassification field to be used for drug classifications. Specifically, within our Therapeutic profile add the ability to reference an instance of Medication Knowledge Resource. This need not be a required field. recommend working with Pharmacy on this.</p>\n<p>Drug class on it's own is not sufficient to define a medication. But it is a very valuable data element for grouping. I'll grab a screen shot of it being used in production.</p>",

Just a reminder that in general (in US for sure) we are targeting the use of SNOMED CT as the drug product classification concepts because RxClass (from NLM) links the SCT drug class concepts (in the product hierarchy) to RxNorm ingredients. This allows users to have an open-access specific list of drugs that fall within a class. That is not to say other class definitions are off limits but the baseline is SCT.
