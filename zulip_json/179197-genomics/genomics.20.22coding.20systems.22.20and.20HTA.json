        "content": "<p>Several JIRA negative ballot comments were issued against mCODE for genomics-related \"vocab issues\" - namely, a missing \"coding system\" request for the following: SequenceOntology, clinvar, and GTR. Since mCODE's genomics elements are aligning with the CG Reporting IG, I feel that this is an issue that really needs to be driven and resolved by the HL7 genomics working group rather than mCODE.  Here are the HTA tickets that someone on our team started. <br>\nHTA-37. Sequence Ontology.  3/25/21<br>\nHTA-42. ClinVar            6/4/21.<br>\nHTA-43. NCBI Genetic Testing Registry identifier.<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191451\">@Patrick Werner</span> or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191926\">@Joel Schneider</span> - can either of you, or whoever is now handling genomics vocabulary, weigh in on these tickets?  In the short-term, we need URLs to get past code librarians who are more interested in process than the actual issue or content at hand.<br>\nIt does however bring a bigger issue of how our models and  FHIR constructs can better distinguish knowledgebase content  identifiers (e.g.: a GTR test id), nomenclature conventions (e.g.: HGVS), whether these should even be populated as a \"coding system\". Or just thinking aloud, it might need to even be a new data type.  <br>\nGenomics is in the radar for most of this discussion because knowledgebases and variant representation are at core of many of our bindings and to treat them like a terminology coding system to me sounds pretty ridiculous.<br>\ncc: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191447\">@Mark Kramer</span></p>",
