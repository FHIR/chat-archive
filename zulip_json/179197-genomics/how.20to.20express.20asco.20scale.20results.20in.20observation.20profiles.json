In relation to a Plan Definition for the 'lab test information'</p>\n<p>Generally not captured discretely. Which brings up a good point. Not everything is going to need to be discrete to accomplish the job of transmitting the information. It's tricky to determine how much to make discrete versus simply send as a string. Questions to ask are: how will the data element be used? what's the purpose in sending it? will it be computed upon? does it need to be accessible as a thing that a computer will do a calculation with?</p>\n<p>Not everything a lab sends is valuable downstream - maybe a bit shocking but some of the information is regulatory (like a signing a EULA before being able to install software you've paid for - you're going to sign weather you like it or not as you already decided to buy it or use it) - best to focus on the data elements that are going to need to be calculated upon. Display elements are a little trickier, each system may have a different idea of how the User interface should look (e.g. Maybe they don't display the HGVS. But you would still want to send it. Or in the UI they are expecting one field that conveys 'GeneX Exon#' as a single element). </p>\n<p>We've tried to use the Implications to provide a more reliable way for some of the clinically valuable, higher level concepts that are needed. This allows one to focus the Variant, Haplotype and Genotype on the discrete, genetic <em>variation</em> observation. You can use it to get  a gene name added Or you could take the geneID component and slice Observation.component, but that's just my opinion.</p>",
