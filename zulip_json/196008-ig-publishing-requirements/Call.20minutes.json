Fixing that is a fix to something that IG readers see, but should not require this process to be followed with all the sign off. It should be for a change to what IG readers are intended to see</p>\n<p>Second issue is similar: we regularly get IG authors (Lloyd!) asking for changes to allow something new far down in the edge of what we're doing, and it won't impact anyone else. the IG publisher team should be allowed to create new edge case functionality that is reasonably expected that won't impact on anyone else without going through the envisioned review process</p>\n<p>Same for fixing bugs in e.g. snapshot generation, that impact on IG authors</p>\n<p>Also, the definition is obtuse with regard to some of the most significant changes we make for HL7 IG authors: increasing validation that causes new entries to appear in qa.html</p>",

For stuff like 2016May-specific changes, where there's only one implementer in the world, agree seeking feedback doesn't make sense.  If introducing something not yet used but that eventually many might use, seeking discussion on how it should work at the outset is probably still appropriate.</p>\n<p>Fixing the validator to detect things that are true errors or warnings according to the spec wouldn't need this process.  Adding on additional layers of QA beyond what the specification mandates would presumably come through this process.</p>",
