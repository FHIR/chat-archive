(<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191832\">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> I think this also supersedes <a href=\"https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/issues/82\">https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/issues/82</a>.)  Feedback welcome and hopefully we'll have time to discuss next Tuesday.</p>",
