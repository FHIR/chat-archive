I don't want to move the publisher changes up until post-ballot opening, just in case they have a negative impact.  (Very unlikely, but better safe than sorry.)<br>\nIf feedback about the change is positive, I'll move up the publisher changes immediately post-ballot, give people a few days to play with a local branch copy of the template and make sure it seems happy on a variety of IGs, then move it to the 'current' version of the template.</p>",
