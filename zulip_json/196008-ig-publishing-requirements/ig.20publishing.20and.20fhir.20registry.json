We are currently working on an oncology implementation guide (see <a href=\"https://fhir.arkhn.com/osiris/\">https://fhir.arkhn.com/osiris/</a>) and we are wondering about publishing it on <a href=\"http://registry.fhir.org\">registry.fhir.org</a>.<br>\nIs the IG publishing process explained on confluence related to the publication on the fhir registry or are they two distinct things ?<br>\nIn my comprehension, the ig publishing process is to develop hl7 official ig, right ?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Implementation+Guide+Process+Flow\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Implementation+Guide+Process+Flow</a> </p>\n<p>thanks in advance for your answer !</p>",
