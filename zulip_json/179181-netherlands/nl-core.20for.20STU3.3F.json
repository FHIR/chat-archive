We'll have to deal with what we find, but in principle no content changes are expected. The only changes within expectation are the ones that are necessary for STU3 compliance.<br>\n.<br>\nYou sent me a private email that I'd like to post here too, because it pertains to work of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191800\">@Ben Schrijver</span> and potentially to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192814\">@Theo Stolker</span> as they are already working with STU3. Fellows please note that your profiles are currently invisible to us.<br>\n.<br>\nTranslated from your email:<br>\n\"I've made a private conversion of the DSTU2 nl-core profiles to STU3. Most is straight forward, but here are some open issues:<br>\n.<br>\n1- Examples need labels in STU3, and did not add those yet, so they are in comments for now<br>\n2- Constraints are in comments, because I did not get to converting those to Fluentpath. I don't get why Fluentpath is not optional rather than required<br>\n3- Not all Element.ids are unqiue right now. Schema doesn't complain but seems in error to me, e.g. Organization.extension. What's the strategy here? Organization.extension.1 and Organization.extension.2 for example?<br>\n4- Added derivation value=\"constraint\" everywhere, otherwise the schema complains. But sometimes profiles might be a specialization, or a combination.<br>\n5- What is the new caonical URI for the STU3 profiles? Something like \"<a href=\"http://fhir.nl/fhir3/StructureDefinition/nl-core-organization\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhir.nl/fhir3/StructureDefinition/nl-core-organization\">http://fhir.nl/fhir3/StructureDefinition/nl-core-organization</a>\"?\"<br>\n.<br>\nThese all good points. I've set up a mass conversion locally, and will be going through that route, unless Simplifier offers this (it already offers a number of services like that). This is something MedMij will be doing in cooperation with Furore.<br>\n.<br>\n1. I think I'll mass add labels with fixed text \"example\" and update them to something more useful over time<br>\n2. I believe we have already the Fluentpath expressions in an extension present, so I'm not too worried yet, but we will need to check<br>\n3. That is most definitely a bug in the DSTU2 profiles then that we need to fix<br>\n4. I think constraint is a good default. We might need to revisit them by hand<br>\n5. We have not decided. I would go a little bit different probably \"<a href=\"http://fhir.nl/fhir-stu3/StructureDefinition/nl-core-organization\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhir.nl/fhir-stu3/StructureDefinition/nl-core-organization\">http://fhir.nl/fhir-stu3/StructureDefinition/nl-core-organization</a>\"<br>\n    This could also be a point in time where we rethink the canonical logic, since we may never end up hosting anything at that URL. I do not have the answer there yet.</p>\n<p>Hope that covers a number of your questions.</p>",

Its canonical is currently \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/VisionPrescription\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/VisionPrescription\">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/VisionPrescription</a>\". I'm not convinced these go to \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/StructureDefinition/VisionPrescription\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/StructureDefinition/VisionPrescription\">http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/StructureDefinition/VisionPrescription</a>\" upon update in 2 weeks time so it is impossible to tell from the canonical what FHIR version it binds to. I'm sure Lloyd/Grahame would say that's because the canonical points to the logical intention and that the FHIR version doesn't matter at that level. That is at least what I understood from a similar discussion around ValueSet.url</p>",
