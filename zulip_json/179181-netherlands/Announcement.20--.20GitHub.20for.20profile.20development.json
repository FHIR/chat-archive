        "content": "<p>Hi all. After talks with ZorgDomein and earlier talks with other parties today we, Nictiz/MedMij reached some conclusions that I feel are helpful to share here. We'll be coming back on that next week during the WGM NL as well:<br>\n.<br>\nWe anticipate FHIR to take off in The Netherlands on STU3. STU3 became a fact today at <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir\">http://hl7.org/fhir</a>. Now that STU3 is live with some last minute polishing going on, it is time for the tools to update. Furore has posted a roadmap for that here <a href=\"https://thefhirplace.com/2017/03/02/simplifier-and-forge-migration-to-stu3/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://thefhirplace.com/2017/03/02/simplifier-and-forge-migration-to-stu3/\">https://thefhirplace.com/2017/03/02/simplifier-and-forge-migration-to-stu3/</a><br>\n.<br>\nFor the first rounds of profiling and to accomodate pilots/kickstarts we have been working on DSTU2. The result of that may be found on Simplifier: <a href=\"https://www.simplifier.net/NL-BasicComponents\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.simplifier.net/NL-BasicComponents\">https://www.simplifier.net/NL-BasicComponents</a> and <a href=\"https://www.simplifier.net/Nictiz\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.simplifier.net/Nictiz\">https://www.simplifier.net/Nictiz</a>.<br>\n.<br>\nTheoretically we could start on STU3 profiling when Forge and Simplifier are ready. But that would be May 6 if the roadmap turns out to be accurate. This is difficult to wait for for ZorgDomein, but likely also for IKNL, potentially for people working on preparations for VIPP and what not. So we want to work ahead and this appears possible with a little help of <a href=\"http://github.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com\">github.com</a>.<br>\n.<br>\nAs of today we'll feverishly be working on getting our development onto GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Nictiz\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Nictiz\">https://github.com/Nictiz</a>. Here you'll find 4 repositories NL-BasicComponents (DSTU2 / STU3) and MedMij (DSTU2 / STU3). The idea is this:<br>\n.<br>\n- Development/maintenance is fully out in the open on github (we worked in a closed environment before). This gives you all other features you may or may not already work with such as cloning, pull requests etc.<br>\n- A webhook allows publication of changes from github projects to be pushed to Simplifier allowing for assurance that profiles continue to be published as agreed upon. We have no intention of making any change how in we use Simplifier<br>\n- The STU3 repositories on GitHub allow for cutting edge access to these profiles. As soon as Simplifier is ready for it, we'll be publishing those there too<br>\n.<br>\nSome things are not yet worked out. Versioned canonical URLs, specific slicing issues and maybe more as we go, but we really hope to serve the community better by being as open as possible in every step.

What I haven't done is create fhirpath for constraints. Of course, the decisions needed like canonical URL's, it's just my take, but this should be a decent start for discussion at the WGM.</p>",

The profiles itself contain a mapping as well: the mapping element is populated with the ZIBâ€™s concepts ID.   </p>",
