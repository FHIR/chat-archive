Just by hand, there are probably tools around that work, but none would work fully automatic and the amount of profiles it still manageable.<br>\n.<br>\nDone so far:<br>\n- All profiles are now technically valid. Checked with xsd, sch and Forge STU3 alfa. The only notable exceptions are where I think Forge itself has a problem (notified <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191336\">@Michel Rutten</span> ). These concern profile-on-profile issues and slicing discriminator issues.<br>\n-- date and fhirVersion 3.0.0 added<br>\n-- fixed paths<br>\n-- targetProfile added except for profile-on-profile  and extensions<br>\n.<br>\n- AllergyIntolerance has been checked against its mapping xlsx and should be functionally valid too<br>\n.<br>\n- For everything else, assume that they need functional validation and improvement based on STU3<br>\n.<br>\nHappy Easter! -- Ardon will be improving from here, but we welcome pull requests with valid updates...</p>",
