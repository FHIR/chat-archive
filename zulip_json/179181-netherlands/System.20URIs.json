I *really* dislike the fact that you can argue about these things. OIDs never had this issue. Note that my personal preference if we are going to be readable is something like <a href=\"http://nhg.org/ns/tabel/45\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://nhg.org/ns/tabel/45\">http://nhg.org/ns/tabel/45</a> but for that we would need NHG approval I'd say.

I will take on the task to communicate with them on expectations. It may take a little longer this way, but it does feel right. It will most certainly lead to system uris of type \"<a href=\"http://nhg.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://nhg.org/\">http://nhg.org/</a>....\" They already have candidate URIs that actually resolve and are stable, but they lack the \"readable\" part, e.g. /node/901 would lead to ICPC-1.
