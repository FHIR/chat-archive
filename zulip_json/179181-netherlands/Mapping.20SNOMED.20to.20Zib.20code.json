The question appears to be more related to zibs than to FHIR implementation thereof.</p>\n<p>The question is never to map any SNOMED CT concept to a code in the aforementioned codesystem. The system '2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.4' only exists for concepts not found in SNOMED CT or other relevant system. It could be that something is added to SNOMED CT later on in which case mapping could make sense.</p>\n<p>Where mappings are relevant, the profiles call those out in a ConceptMap. Note that after today I'll be on holiday, hence I flagged a colleague to pick this up after today</p>",

As I do not have the information from the legacy system I could not say if is in this case valid to map Yes onto JA and No onto NO. But if they are found to be the same there would be no problem to do this. However, check! .... the real challenge to me seems the JA_MAAR option.<br>\n(Also see here: <a href=\"https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/MM-961\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/MM-961\">https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/MM-961</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does this make any sense?</p>",
