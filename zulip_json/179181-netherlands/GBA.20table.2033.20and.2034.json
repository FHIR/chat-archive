According to the <a href=\"https://zibs.nl/wiki/Adresgegevens-v1.0(2017NL)\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://zibs.nl/wiki/Adresgegevens-v1.0(2017NL)\">WIKI</a>  the values for district/city and country found in the FHIR message should conform to GBA tables 33 and 34, respectively. Although the use of table 33 is merely advised, it is problematic nonetheless.</p>\n<p>The ISO codes were as problematic if it were not for someone who had already made a piece of open-source java code in which the country codes were already programmed. Sadly, this is not the case for the GBA tables (as far as I know).</p>\n<p>If someone happens to know an open-source java code that fits my needs, I would happily hear where I can get this code.</p>\n<p>There is of course also the case in which the code has not been produced yet, if so, is it not possible to create this code together? I can't imagine I am the only person wanting this code.</p>\n<p>With kind regards,</p>\n<p>Yuri Bonanno</p>\n<p>PS: I am new to this community so I am not sure whether this information should be shared here.</p>",
