Base reference for this discussion: <a href=\"https://github.com/Nictiz/Nictiz-R4-zib2020/issues/41\">https://github.com/Nictiz/Nictiz-R4-zib2020/issues/41</a> (Dutch language)</p>\n<p>R4 adds PractitionerRole to all resources where only Practitioner was an option to reference, but left Practitioner intact. PractitionerRole is the only possibility for stating specialism and/or to relate a physician to a provider. Practitioner gives you identifier/name/address/telecom, i.e. more detail at person level.</p>\n<p>We are unable to assess why you would ever reference Practitioner directly from an Observation, CareTeam, Procedure, MedicationRequest or basically any other setting. So, as we are progressing in R4 development the question comes to mind: do we keep Practitioner as option in the resources we profile, or do we explicitly scratch that option in those profiles? Suppose we leave Practitioner in, what do we need to tell implementers on how to deal with these two options?</p>",
