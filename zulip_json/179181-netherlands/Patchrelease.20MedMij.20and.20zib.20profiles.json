Just wanted to check something - is there anywhere that these updates to zib FHIR profiles and/or MedMij IG's are announced, other than here in the FHIR chat? I feel like only the \"big\" updates (like a whole new standard) gets announced via the broader MedMij/Nictiz news updates, less so these more technical things. Or I might be missing something!</p>",
