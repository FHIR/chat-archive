CBB/DCM) the question was asked: so how does one know, looking at a Resource instance, to what ZIB it conforms to ? Which, given that I'm aware that a ZIB may very well map to multiple resources, I was unable to answer. If there would always be a 1-to-1 relationship the answer would be trivial.<br>\nQuestions: are there any ZIBs whose elements are mapped to a combination of multiple Resources? If the answer to that is yes, then how is conformance currently expressed ? And in the resulting resource instances, what profile is being referenced in those instances to denote that all of them jointly conform to a ZIB ?</p>",
