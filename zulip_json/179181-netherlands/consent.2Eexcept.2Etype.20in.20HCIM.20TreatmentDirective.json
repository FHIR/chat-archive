The corresponding code list in the HCIM/ZIB for Behandelaawijzing/Treatment Directive consists of 3 items - Ja, JA_MAAR, and Nee.  Subject matter experts at Epic hospitals raised that it seems problematic to map JA_MAAR to DENY.  Is there motivation behind the reasoning to have it mapped this way? </p>\n<p>Regards/Groet,<br>\nCliff Wu-Mar√©chal<br>\nEpic Den Bosch</p>",
