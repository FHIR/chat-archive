I'm inspecting the BodyWeight element in the ZIBs: <a href=\"https://zibs.nl/wiki/Lichaamsgewicht-v3.2(2020NL)\">https://zibs.nl/wiki/Lichaamsgewicht-v3.2(2020NL)</a>. This specifies an optional field for Clothing. I'm searching for this attribute in the latest Nicitz FHIR profile: <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/packages/nictiz.fhir.nl.stu3.zib2017/2.1.1/files/362324/~details\">https://simplifier.net/packages/nictiz.fhir.nl.stu3.zib2017/2.1.1/files/362324/~details</a> . This does not show the Clothing attribute. Am I looking at the wrong place? What happened with this attribute?</p>",

So not sure which use case you are implementing, but if it is for example BgZ, <a href=\"https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/MedMij:V2020.01/FHIR_BGZ_2017#List_of_profiles\">this would be the implementation guide</a> which reference the correct profiles in the table.<br>\nSome bulletwise observations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You refer to the BodyWeight zib in release 2020. No published profiles exists for them. They are currently being developed.</li>\n<li>The FHIR profile is a copy of the HL7 FHIR vital signs profiles and fixes some errors that have been fixed in R4 already. It is not the 'end' profile. Which would be: <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/packages/nictiz.fhir.nl.stu3.zib2017/2.1.5/files/389765\">https://simplifier.net/packages/nictiz.fhir.nl.stu3.zib2017/2.1.5/files/389765</a></li>\n<li>There is a <code>Observation.component</code> slice in that profile that holds the clothing concept of the zib.</li>\n</ul>",
