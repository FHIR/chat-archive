As for the specific differences you found:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://Patient.name\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Patient.name\">Patient.name</a> has not been made required in the profile because there will be use cases (currently not covered by the zib) that don't require the name. Leaving it optional would still make the zib implementable. Presumably you could create a profile-on-profile to add that extra requirement. We generally did not go there just yet until we know our base is stable</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://Patient.name\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Patient.name\">Patient.name</a> has a datatype level profile nl-core-humanname. You will find all the extensions we deemed necessary. Since \"given\" is a core element meant for given names, there's really no need to further qualify that unless you want to mark it as \"initials\" for example. If you don't qualify HumanName.given, the semantics are already that these concern first/given names.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the Patient profile has been in existence since 2016 and has already undergone various rounds of input. It has even been approved by the FHIR Council/Validation Team. It doesn't mean we cannot update it, though...</p>",

For instance, ZIB calls the \"CD\" datatype a \"Coded Descriptions\", while ISO 21090 calls it a \"Concept Descriptor\", HL7 v3 uses the term \"Concept Descriptor\" as well. There is absolutely no consistency.</p>\n<p>ZIB choose one of two routes:<br>\n- Use an existing standard as a reference for its datatypes (perhaps restricting the attributes), such as ISO or HL7<br>\n- Describe its own datatypes fully and without anchoring it in an existing standard, perhaps using an existing standard as a starting point, but not as a definitive source</p>",

From what I can find about it, DCM is just an underlying standard describing how you could create a concrete healthcare model. But DCM itself does not define any datatypes. See also this post I found: <a href=\"https://wolandscat.net/2011/09/11/dcm-data-types-and-reference-model-considerations/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://wolandscat.net/2011/09/11/dcm-data-types-and-reference-model-considerations/\">https://wolandscat.net/2011/09/11/dcm-data-types-and-reference-model-considerations/</a></p>\n<p>I am okay with any direction that ZIB chooses, as long as it is consistent and well defined. I think aligning with or using (a restricted version of) ISO is definitely a decent option. A lot of these datatypes are very common, so maybe it needs to be done on another level (maybe in a DCM Reference Model itself) such as is suggested by the blog post I mentioned.</p>",
