What do MedMij en Zorgdomein do? Of course, data-absent-reason is 'real' FHIR, on the other hand we have loads of valuesets in ART-DECOR which use v3. Translation won't work, since data-absent-reason misses OTH, which is widely used in our valuesets.</p>",

And, for that matter, a companion element allowing capture of the reason for missing data should be provided for non-coded elements if this falls within the 80% (e.g. Observation.dataAbsentReason). The data-absent-reason extension is for use when such information is not supported by most systems.</p>",
