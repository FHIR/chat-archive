I'm working on a prototype where I extracted some clinical data out of the EHR. <br>\nI was able to store all kinds of clinical concepts into FHIR resources according to the FHIR specification STU3.  For all FHIR resources, I created profiles and valuesets to validate the resources.  Now, I would like to know how to realize in practice the mapping of specific FHIR resources to particular ZIBs.</p>\n<p>Kind regard,<br>\nWerner</p>",

        "content": "<p>I don't think I follow the question. Where and sometimes how you map zib related data into FHIR is contained in the mappings for the existing set of zib related profiles. You may find that set here: <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/NictizSTU3-Zib2017/~resources\">https://simplifier.net/NictizSTU3-Zib2017/~resources</a>. Mappings are defined and visible on the mapping tab of any profile, like <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/NictizSTU3-Zib2017/nl-core-patient/~mappings\">Patient</a>.</p>\n<p>How you get stuff out of FHIR back into your EHR depends highly on the technology stack. Relevant strreams could include <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179167\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179167-hapi\">#hapi</a>  and <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179177\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179177-conformance\">#conformance</a>. Does that help?</p>",
