This is the address that e.g. you will receive mail from governmental agencies, police, tax agency, insurance companies etc. It is also the address you will find if you search for a person's address details on various online address search services.  It is not the same as a \"Home address\" as a person can live in two places, and have two \"Home addresses\", but one of them would be the \"official\" address. </p>\n<p>Regarding your questions:<br>\n- Boolean is fine with us as well, it matches our requirements above<br>\n- I'm a bit unsure if 0..1 or 1..1 is better. If I interpret it correctly, having 1..1 means you can never be uncertain about whether an address is the official address? That seems to me be a potential use case. Patient gives their address, and later it is found that it is the official address. My feeling is also that restraining 1..1 could be done on a profile level, and leave the extension 0..1 for more flexibility. Thoughts? <br>\n-Timestamping is not needed for us either</p>\n<p>A question back to you:<br>\n- Can you have multiple Dutch official addresses? As mentioned above, Swedes can't, so I suspect we would use a constraint of some sort.</p>",

The 'official status' extension is present when it is a known true|false, hence 1..1 Boolean. Would that work for you too?</p>\n<p>We don't a have a 'master file' issue. There's only one official registry for a persons address and you can have only one. There's also only one registry for a business' official address. For businesses the official address maybe have limited use as businesses can have many locations. In practice the official marker is only relevant for private addresses.
