Is there a reason that there is a specific extension for this?  Is there additional value (now, or in the future) that a Dutch-specific extension will provide for conveying allergy status? Otherwise, this seems like an opportunity to streamline the profile.</p>\n<p>Groet/regards,<br>\nCliff Wu-Maréchal<br>\nEpic Den Bosch</p>",
