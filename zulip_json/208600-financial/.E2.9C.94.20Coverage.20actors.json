Maybe someone may help me on 'Coverage' actors, and correct definition of who's who. <br>\nAs far as my understanding go:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>policyHolder - is the party through which the policy is provided? In my case that`s an employer</li>\n<li>subscriber - patient\\person who is 'paying' for the insurance uphold</li>\n<li>payor - the party that will fulfill the obligation to pay insurance costs in case it will happen</li>\n<li>beneficiary - whoever is insured under the Coverage, and in case insurance event comes - will be paid according to contractual obligations</li>\n</ul>",

Commonly: Policyholder=employer; subscriber=employee; payor=insurance company; beneficiary=the insured. For simple coverage such as when each beneficiary has their own member ID and the coverage is state-wide or national you may only have the payor and beneficiary. Member ID goes in the Coverage.identifier.</p>",
