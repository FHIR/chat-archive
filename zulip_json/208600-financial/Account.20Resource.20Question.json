The “Account” FHIR resource is the obvious choice but I don’t think the existing “Account” resource has the level of detail we need in order to map all data elements, such as subscriber account balances and account summary level balance monetary amounts. Can anyone tell me if FHIR objects already exist for this type of data? I can’t seem to find them. I’ll be attending the HL7 Financial Management work group sessions where I can also bring up this topic for discussion. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191924\">@Linda</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191430\">@Paul Knapp</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196176\">@Sonja Ziegler</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191884\">@MaryKay McDaniel</span></p>",

However, I think dependent should be an identifier, etc. And there seemed to be much discussion and not unity on the type element list as well as the coverage class code list.  I think it would be worthwhile to review one an upcoming call whether it be FM or the Payment/Statements call.  Also during that meeting in September, several people (me included) mentioned needing a DAM for representing all data in the Finance space in US.</p>",
