We're debating the use of Claim/ClaimResponse over the EOB resource for this purpose. However, the audience for our API is <em>not</em> claim processors and the use case doesn't really fit into the request/response workflow pattern identified in the FHIR spec.  Instead it is more targeted at ACOs who need aggregates, analytics, reporting, etc.  Torn between the two options.  EOB might be a better fit, but EOB does imply \"adjudicated\".  Claim and CR seem less mature / less implemented.  Wondering if anyone has an opinion on this?  Does anyone know of a group who is working with Claim and CR as well as EOB.  To my knowledge, DaVinci and CARIN mostly focus on EOB.  Thanks for any direction.</p>",
