As part of that effort, we're mapping <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/sharedsavingsprogram/Downloads/2019-CCLF-file-data-elements-resource.pdf\">CCLF fields</a> to FHIR.  When this is completed, finalized and reviewed, wondering if this is something that should be added to  the FHIR spec mappings e.g. <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/fhir/explanationofbenefit-mappings.html\">EOB mappings</a></p>",

I'm one of the HL7 Financial Management co-chairs, please come to one of our calls (Tuesday 11-1 ET) to discuss.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks Paul.  Starting with the IG makes a lot of sense and I will join a Tues call soon.  I've just recently joined the AdHoc team, so still getting my feet wet, but the impression I've gotten so far is that we're maybe a bit disconnected from the FHIR community so I'd like to also pick your brain on that.  I'd like to ensure that, where it makes sense, the DPC + BCDA projects stay aligned with and collaborate with DaVinci, Financial Mgmt Group, Argonaut, etc.  Thanks again for your feedback.  Talk soon.</p>",
