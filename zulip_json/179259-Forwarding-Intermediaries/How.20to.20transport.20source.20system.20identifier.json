Each connected EHR system has a nationally provisioned identifier. The data of an EHR may be (locally, regionally) replicated into a regional data hub that acts as the server to which the national intermediary forwards requests to get the requested responses. Each record of the response should contain the identifier of the originating system (EHR) instance. We struggle on how to map that to FHIR. Any ideas are appreciated!</p>",
