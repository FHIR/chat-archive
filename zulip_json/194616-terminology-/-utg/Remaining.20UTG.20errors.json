There's a definitional problem associated with that extension but that extension should not exist in UTG. So proposed fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>CodeSystem/data-absent-reason - remove this from UTG; it's normative in the FHIR space (special case)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>same for CodeSystem/message-transport</li>\n<li>also CodeSystem/restful-security-service</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CodeSystem/definition-use - remove the normative marker in UTG, and correct that it is wrongly labelled in the next R4 technical correction</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And make the same changes in the matching value sets</p>",
