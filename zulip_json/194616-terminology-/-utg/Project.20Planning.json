I updated this today on Confluence so it is up-to-date. Our next major milestone is to get all of the required tasks (highlighted in yellow on the project plan) complete prior to the TSC demo of UTG functionality on 1/20. That call will guide how we move forward. I'm happy to review the plan and major timelines with you if that helps.</p>",

The assignee is simply who we believe will primarily be involved in the task. Many of these require policy/governance decisions before they can be implemented. No immediate action is required and apologies in advance for all of the notifications that will come out of this transition. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191982\">@Ted Klein</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196484\">@Joshua Procious</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191333\">@Reuben Daniels</span></p>",
