But I think the consensus in Vocab generally has been that \"deprecated\" codes are still considered to be \"active\" (just discouraged from any new use, and are expected to be retired in the future).  As far as I know the deprecation policy group that's meeting (had a meeting earlier today) hasn't changed that - but we could verify. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191982\">@Ted Klein</span>?</p>",

This was ratified with the notion that 'deprecated' is NOT retired or inactive, it is a usage guidance around 'active'.   Because of differences in interpretation of these human language words, I am a proponent of making the controls for whether codes having certain values as concept properties should be included in value set expansions to be very explicit so the we do not get differences in server behaviors around the globe.     For sure if there is an indication in the CLD to include only active codes in an expansion, then absolutely ones that are not active (retired or any of the other states that are not active ) should absolutely not be included in the expansion I would think.</p>",
