Just noticing that the <a href=\"https://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem-v2-tables.html\">CodeSystem that lists the v2 tables</a> has a property <code>steward</code> for each concept (i.e. listed v2 Table), the values of which are different from the value for <code>publisher</code> found in each of the corresponding v2 CodeSystem resources.  Reasonable evidence that 'steward' and 'publisher' are different roles.</p>",
