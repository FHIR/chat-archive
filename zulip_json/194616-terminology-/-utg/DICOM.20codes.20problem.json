The HTA pages I think are being worked on responding to comments on them from John.    The OID 1.2.840.10008.2.16.4 has been registered in the HL7 OID registry since June 2003, and it has been published as a code system stub (no content) in v3 with that OID since that time.   I'll make the technical correction fix tomorrow.</p>",
