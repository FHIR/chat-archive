The ENVIRONMENT SETUP state doesn't really provide options for anything like that.  UP-211 was an initial (and abortive) attempt to create the proposal, but somehow at the time that hadn't quite seemed to work and instead I created UP-212, which is the actual proposal that is being moved forward.</p>",

So you can always push it out of Environment Setup and then Abandon it (which I believe allows you to set the reason to duplicate). Worth considering allowing abandoning from proposals from Environment Setup as well. I think it is a good idea.</p>",
