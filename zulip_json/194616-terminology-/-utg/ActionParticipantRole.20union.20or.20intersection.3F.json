It seems pretty clear to me based on the xml that it's meant to be a union rather than an intersection and thus should have two compose.includes rather than a single compose.include with multiple valuesets.  I just want to get at least a second opinion on it to make sure that I'm not missing something.  Edit to add: There's also some other issues with the value set. The version doesn't match the version in R4, it doesn't have a title element, and some other oddities...</p>",
