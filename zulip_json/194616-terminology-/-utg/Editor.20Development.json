In the JIRA workflow, we plan to send those that ask for any change to the SNOMED CT content to the HTA page that describes how to request content changes from SNOMED.  Full stop.   The second question is a bit more subtle; right now for testing and demonstration purposes, I have bundled the same international copy of SNOMED CT that you have on the FHIR pages into UTG, but this is pending discussion with Vocab and TSC and HTA and perhaps others as to what we want to do about this.   I'll ask Julie that this be added to the HTA agenda for a recommendation.</p>",
