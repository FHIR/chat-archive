Will download it now and check everything.   RE: the email - we do not, but that may be a great idea.  Setting up a JIRA workflow and entry with Josh for logging UTG errors, but this is primarily for content issues that need fixing (the old \"open issues\" stuff mostly).  But an email list might be very handy, at least now in the beginning when we are just rolling it out and ironing out problems.    Build errors now down to the last couple subtle ones, expect to have those solved by tonight or tomorrow morning US EDT.    Let me know when you want to speak - maybe either early today (your time before I go to bed here) or before you are done for the night tomorrow (when I wake up my Friday morning).</p>",

Once you get a notion of when you may get around to that please let me know.   The item that Lloyd pointed out was that the publisher is inserting &lt;title&gt; as \"Definition\" for all of the pages generated for Value Sets, but the template is also  inserting &lt;title&gt; as \"Content Logical\".  Thus two section headers.  Lloyd suggests either you change the publisher to say \"Content Logical Definition\" and he will remove it from the template, or alternatively you remove it from the Publisher and he will keep it as a mandatory item in the template.  But we should not have both.   Did I get that correct <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> ?</p>",
