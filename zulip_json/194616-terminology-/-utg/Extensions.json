Entertaininly, the Help-&gt;About works...but shows version 0.0.58;  So perhaps the OSX version of the latest 0.0.59 is not linked for download there, and/or perhaps only the Windows version of 0.0.59 is the one that does not show it.    It is Sunday evening here, so Jess will respond when she gets in tomorrow morning I would imagine.</p>",
