Things like changing the is-a plus an exclude to just a descendent-of, fixing a few issues with bad names, etc.    But there are some other issues that I think are either publisher issues or perhaps policy issues (or both) and I've been waiting to post them here until we figure out what to do about this big tranche.    One example are a few v2 value sets which are explicitly enumerated - a subset of codes of the underlying code system.   The build complains because the implicit generated 'all codes' value set is autogenerated with the same name/id as the explicit enumerated one.  Can get around it by manually changing the name/id of the explicit one, easy enough - but we should decide the policy first. A few oddball items like that.</p>",
