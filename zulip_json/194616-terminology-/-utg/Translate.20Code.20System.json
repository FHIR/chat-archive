These are being tracked via <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/HSCR-141\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/HSCR-141</a> and as Grahame mentioned requires governance. From the ticket: There is currently no way to support translations that affiliates make available in THO. There is no way to attribute translations to a publisher, there is no versioning for translations, and we do not have decisions from Vocab that we will publish translations for HL7 content supplied by affiliates as part of THO. There may also be some time before we can export only particular languages.</p>",
