The only thing holding up updating the property definitions on the code systems is when I can I turn Dave T loose on it and he can commit and push without the four of us tripping over each other.   If we are good to go now, then I'll tell him he's good to pull to synch then regenerate the resources for the properties.   That having been said...part of the reason that they are not properly defined is that I don't have the ability to update the FHIR code system of properties.   If, once we create the URLs that don't find the missing codes we can semi-automatically create the proper definitions, then great.  Otherwise, please let me know what I need to do to make it happen - ie each of the entries in that code system I can create if you like then you or someone else (Lloyd?  Rob H?) can update the code system with the additions.   Please let me know how you would like me to proceed.</p>",
