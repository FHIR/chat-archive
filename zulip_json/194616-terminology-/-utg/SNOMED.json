For SNOMED CT (the entire \"family\" of editions), the URI is <a href=\"http://snomed.info/sct\">http://snomed.info/sct</a>. The issue here, I think, is that we have a THO resource specifically for the SCT International Edition that has the base URL but no codesystem.version (i.e. 900000000000207008) information to accurately represent the international SNOMED edition.</p>",
