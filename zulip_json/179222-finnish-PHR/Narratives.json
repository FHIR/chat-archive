Then I’ll be able to reflect that on the guidance to be provided. Thanks!</p>",

In addition, the narrative of a resource will be shown in Omakanta when the citizen browses his/her resources stored in My Kanta Pages PHR.</p>\n<p>We encourage the creators' of the profiles to define the content that should be represented in the narrative, as you have the best knowledge of the use of the profile and the data stored in resources conforming to the profile.</p>",
