I checked the latest Finnish PHR Medication Administration Profile in Simplifier and it doesn't yet seem to mention how to use the ATC codes as agreed on how to enter insulin dosing when only the type of insulin is known. Am I just misreading the profile or is this still being worked on? If these are still coming, it'd be extremely useful if sample records using both ATC and VNR codes were in included in Simplifier.</p>",
