I don't see any reason why a new Provenance resource would be created each time a client requests the data - there should be a single, stable resource ID for a Provenance record describing the payer's role in transmitting the referenced FHIR resource, regardless of the requester. Whether this is retrieved through _revinclude or GET should make no difference.</p>",
