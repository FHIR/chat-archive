You basically type some FSH in on the left side of the screen, click a button, and get JSON on the right side of the screen.  It's a pure HTML/JS/CSS app with client-side execution -- so it runs on a simple HTTP server (or in our case, GitHub Pages).  That being the case, it will not support HTTP web service calls or remote execution (because that would require a server capable of server-side javascript).</p>",
