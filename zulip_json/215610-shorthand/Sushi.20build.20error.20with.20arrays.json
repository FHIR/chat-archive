It works great except for when I´m trying to create an example Patient and explicity trying to set an extension in the second given name: * name[0].given[1].extension[nameQualifier].valueCode = #CL <br>\nWhen setting the extension on the first given name it works fine, but when refering the second given name I get a build error in sushi.

I think that the intent is that the name qualifier extension should be applicable to any <code>HumanName.given</code>, but in this case, SUSHI is accepting it on a specific name's <code>given[0]</code>, but not on its <code>given[1]</code>.  That feels like a SUSHI bug to me and we will try to reproduce it and fix it.</p>",
