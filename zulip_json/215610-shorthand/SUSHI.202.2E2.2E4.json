In past versions of SUSHI, if the id contained one or more path separators, it was possible to cause SUSHI to write the JSON file to other locations on the filesystem. This behavior could be abused to intentionally overwrite existing JSON files.  The utility of leveraging this bug, however, is limited by the fact that the file contents would still be a FHIR resource (i.e., you cannot force it to write arbitrary JSON).  In this version of SUSHI, the bug has been fixed by properly sanitizing file names before writing them to disk.</p>\n<p><strong>Install or Update</strong></p>\n<p>To install or update to this release, run the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>$ npm install -g fsh-sushi\n</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>More Information</strong></p>\n<p>For more details on this release, see the <a href=\"https://github.com/FHIR/sushi/releases/tag/v2.2.4\">SUSHI 2.2.4 Release Notes</a>.</p>",
