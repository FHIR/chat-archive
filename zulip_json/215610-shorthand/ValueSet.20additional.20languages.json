        "content": "<p>So unfortunately, this is currently not so easy to do. It is possible, but instead of using a ValueSet, you have to use the Instance keyword to create a <code>Usage: #definition</code> Instance of a ValueSet. This thread has a detailed example of how this can be done to create a more advanced CodeSystem: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/215610-shorthand/topic/Creating.20an.20advanced.20codesystem\" title=\"#narrow/stream/215610-shorthand/topic/Creating.20an.20advanced.20codesystem\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/215610-shorthand/topic/Creating.20an.20advanced.20codesystem</a>. You would have to take a similar approach for ValueSet in this case. If you have further questions about applying the approach in that thread to a ValueSet, let us know! Be wary though of the warning given by Chris at the end of that thread. We haven't tested this approach as thoroughly as the more basic usage of the ValueSet keyword.</p>",

The <code>Title</code> keyword on an instance is only used in the ImplementationGuide in the way shown above. We cannot use the <code>Title</code> keyword to also set the <code>title</code> field on an Instance, because not every Resource has a <code>title</code> field. Yes a ValueSet does, but something like an Observation does not, so we would not want to set Observation.title, since that field should not exist. So if you also wanted to set <code>ValueSet.title</code>, you must do </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Instance: MyVsInstance\nInstanceOf: ValueSet\nTitle: &quot;This is the title that goes in the ImplementationGuide&quot;\n* title = &quot;This is the title on the ValueSet resource&quot;\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Let me know if that doesn't make sense, it's a bit of a quirky situation.</p>",
