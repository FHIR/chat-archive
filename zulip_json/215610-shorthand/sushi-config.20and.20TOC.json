If this property is used, SUSHI will not generate any page entries. The YAML key is the file name containing the page. The title key-value pair provides the title for the page. If a title is not provided, then the title will be generated from the file name. If a generation value (corresponding to definition.page.generation) is not provided, it will be inferred from the file name extension. In the IG resource, pages can contain sub-pages; so in the config file, any sub-properties that are valid filenames with supported extensions (e.g., .md/.xml) will be treated as sub-pages.</p>\n</blockquote>",
