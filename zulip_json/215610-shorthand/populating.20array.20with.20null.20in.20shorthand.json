I also goFSHed a JSON file that has a null where I would like it but the FSH file shows nothing. Is there a way to do this in FSH or is this a special case where I am forced to work directly on the JSON? If so, this is a problem, as SUSHI always deletes the resources folder so this means I would be forced to save the JSON in a separate location, which is problematic at this point.</p>",

If you want the array element itself to be null, however, SUSHI does not currently have a way of doing this.</p>",
