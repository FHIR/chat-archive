Since we generate the IG JSON, I don't think it should go in <code>input</code>.  The IG Publisher does just fine w/ the IG in <code>fsh-generated/resources</code> as long as the <code>ig.ini</code> correctly points to it.  That said, I could probably be convinced to put it at the root of <code>fsh-generated</code> instead, but that might require further changes to the base template?</p>",
