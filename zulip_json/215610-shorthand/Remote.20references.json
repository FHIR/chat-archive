When I want to create an example/instance of the patient-profile, while including a managingOrganization I get the following error: <em>Reference is remote which isn't supported by the specified aggregation mode(s) for the reference (bundled)</em>. <br>\nDoes anyone know if there is a way I can work around/avoid this error while keeping the aggregation mode to {b} for the managaingOrganization?  Thank you in advance</p>",
