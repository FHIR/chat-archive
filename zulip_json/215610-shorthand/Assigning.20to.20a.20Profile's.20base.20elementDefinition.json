I don't see a way that FSH syntax allows this, as the base type is stripped from assignments (e.g <code>Observation.code ^short</code> is just <code>code ^short</code>).</p>\n<p>I'd like to assign a \"short\" and \"definition\" to the first elementDefinition but elements in snapshot and differential can't be written to directly, <code>Observation ^short</code> isn't correct syntax due to the stripping and <code>^short</code> doesn't exist as written either.</p>\n<p>The end goal is to make the first line of the table and first entry in the detailed description of, for example <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/2021MAY/StructureDefinition-mcode-tumor-size.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/2021MAY/StructureDefinition-mcode-tumor-size.html</a> be specific to that profile rather than what is inherited from base Observation.

Any thoughts?</p>",
