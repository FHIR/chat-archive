What SUSHI does is first look in <code>&lt;home&gt;/.fhir/packages</code> to see if a package is available locally, and if the package is there, SUSHI will load from there. Only if the package is not locally available will SUSHI download the definitions into this local cache. So as long as the definitions have been cached one time, and as long as you don't delete them from your FHIR cache, SUSHI can be used offline.</p>",
