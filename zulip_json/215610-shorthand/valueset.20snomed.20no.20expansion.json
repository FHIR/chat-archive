I have the importer issue resolved now and I'm happy to try again and I think we should be able to make progress with this now.  The main thing that we need to make it work is a current and complete Swedish edition snapshot in a single set of files (that's what Daniel and I had worked on, but I think it likely will need some updating now).</p>",
