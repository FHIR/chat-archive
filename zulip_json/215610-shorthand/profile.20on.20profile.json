You're current that a profile of a profile should inherit the values of the parent profile. I believe that in your example, <code>DrugProductwithImpurites</code> should have a <code>baseDefinition</code> that points to <code>DrugProduct</code>.  The additional profile won't show up in the diff view, but any examples of <code>DrugProductwithImpurites</code> should conform any rules in the parent profile and the snapshot should include rules from the parent profile.</p>",

I believe the changes that you make on the <code>DrugProduct</code> profile should still be applied to the <code>DrugProductwithImpurites</code> profile. However, they will not show up in the Differential table on <code>DrugProductwithImpurites</code> because they are not differences on that particular profile - they were differences on <code>DrugProduct</code> instead, but not on <code>DrugProductwithImpurites</code>. If you look at the full Snapshot table, are the changes you made in <code>DrugProduct</code> applied to the appropriate elements?</p>",
