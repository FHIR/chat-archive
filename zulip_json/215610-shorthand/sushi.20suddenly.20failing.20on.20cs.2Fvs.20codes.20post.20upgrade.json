        "content": "<p>Thanks for reporting this, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"380122\">@Kippi Bordowitz</span>.  I've done a simple reproduction of the issue on FSH Online here: <a href=\"https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/share/3vLYBUq\">https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/share/3vLYBUq</a></p>\n<p>I agree that the above <em>should</em> work, BUT it is not the best practice (or common) approach to defining CodeSystems in FSH.  Since you are using all <code>^</code> rules, it actually would work better as an <code>Instance</code>.  I've tried that and found that it does not produce any errors: <a href=\"https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/share/3tEoGBY\">https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/share/3tEoGBY</a></p>\n<p>That said, the BEST approach would be to use the new <a href=\"https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/shorthand/reference.html#defining-code-systems\">CodeSystem syntax</a> introduced in FSH 2.0, which allows you to set metadata properties.  This is much cleaner.  Here is what that would look like: <a href=\"https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/share/3pJ1uBm\">https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/share/3pJ1uBm</a></p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>CodeSystem: PayingEntityMoH\nId: paying-entity-moh\nTitle: &quot;Some Title&quot;\nDescription: &quot;Some Description&quot;\n* ^language = #he-IL\n* ^status = #draft\n* ^url = $payer\n* ^content = #complete\n* #-888 &quot;display 0&quot; &quot;definition 0&quot;\n  * ^property.code = #status\n  * ^property.valueCode = #deprecated\n* #-999 &quot;display 1&quot; &quot;definition 1&quot;\n  * ^property.code = #status\n  * ^property.valueCode = #deprecated\n* #101 &quot;display 2&quot; &quot;definition 2&quot;\n* #102 &quot;display 3&quot; &quot;definition 3&quot;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Also note that <code>^content</code> defaults to <code>#complete</code>, so you don't need to explicitly state that rule if you don't want to. In addition, SUSHI will build default URLs for you too (using the IG canonical), so you only need to set <code>^url</code> if you want to override the default URL that SUSHI assigns.</p>\n<p>We can look into why your original FSH doesn't work, but I would highly recommend converting to the latest syntax if possible.  If that is too tedious and you have an existing formal CodeSystem declaration (in JSON), you could use GoFSH to help. It won't use the indent format, but it will still provide a much cleaner representation. (NOTE: you can use GOFSH on <a href=\"https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/\">FSH Online</a> by using the \"Convert to FSH\" button).</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hmmm... Round-tripping on FSH Online might be easier.  Basically, copy over the existing CodeSystem FSH (and any aliases it uses), then click \"Convert to JSON\".  This gets it into FHIR format on the right-hand-side.  Then click \"Convert to FSH\", which overwrites the left-hand-side with the better FSH representation.</p>\n<p>For example, try it w/ this link.  Go here (<a href=\"https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/share/3ITRlcD\">https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/share/3ITRlcD</a>) then click \"Convert to JSON\" then \"Convert to FSH\" and you'll see what I mean.</p>",
