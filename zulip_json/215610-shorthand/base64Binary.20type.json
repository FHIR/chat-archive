However, this regex seems incorrect. It does not allow the <code>/</code> character, which is used in base64 binary encoding. In the FHIR  schemas for XML and JSON, a different regex is used: <code>(\\s*([0-9a-zA-Z\\+/=]){4}\\s*)+</code>. This regular expression does allow for the <code>/</code> character. It seems to me like we want to use the second regular expression, not the first. But I'm not certain enough in my knowledge of base64Binary in FHIR to just ignore the documentation and change it. If any FSH/SUSHI users have a bit more experience with base64Binary and could help us figure out which regex to use, we'd appreciate it!</p>",
