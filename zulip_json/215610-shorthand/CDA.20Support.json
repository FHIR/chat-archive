        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192418\">@Sean Muir</span>.  You could use FSH to define all of the definitions in <code>input/resources/structuredefinition</code> (instead of XML).  For an existing project like this, I'd recommend starting off with <a href=\"https://fshschool.org/docs/gofsh/\">GoFSH</a>.  I noticed that the XML StructureDefinitions in this project do not contain the snapshot, so the best approach would be to build the IG as-is with IG Publisher first and then run GoFSH against the resulting <code>output</code> folder (from the IG Publisher).  See <a href=\"https://fshschool.org/docs/gofsh/running/#gofsh-best-practices\">GoFSH Best Practices</a> for more tips.</p>",
