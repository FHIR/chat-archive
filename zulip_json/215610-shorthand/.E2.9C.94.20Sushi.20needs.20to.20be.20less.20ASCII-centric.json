Anything else should produce a warning (which is what SUSHI does).  But again... this was established by the FHIR spec, not SUSHI or FSH.</p>\n<p>If you want SUSHI to suppress these warnings, you should be able to do so via a <code>sushi-ignoreWarnings.txt</code> file, documented <a href=\"https://fshschool.org/docs/sushi/project/#ignoring-warnings\">here</a>.</p>",
