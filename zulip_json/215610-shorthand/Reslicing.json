If I have a \"$this\" \"pattern\" slicing in a profile and try to define reslicing on one of the slices in a derived profile, I'm wondering if I should declare ^slicing.discriminator again (for example, if my original slice is based on identifier.type and I need to reslice it based on identifier.system).</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191393\">@Igor Sirkovich</span>.  Finding examples of re-slicing (whether by FSH or not) is hard.  It doesn't seem to be very common.  The <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#reslicing\">FHIR doc on re-slicing</a> isn't totally clear, but I think the general pattern is that you need to declare the <em>re-slicing</em> discriminator on the original slice that you're re-slicing...  So, assuming you want to re-slice sliceA from the original slices, you would have something like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>* identifier[sliceA] ^slicing.discriminator.type = #pattern\n* identifier[sliceA] ^slicing.discriminator.path = &quot;$this&quot;\n* identifier[sliceA] ^slicing.rules = #open\n* identifier[sliceA] contains sliceA1 0..1 and sliceA2 0..1\n// proceed to define sliceA1 and sliceA2 patterns... etc.\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>If the original slicing is sliced by pattern on $this and the re-slicing is <em>also</em> sliced by pattern on $this, then I'm not sure how SUSHI will react to you setting a <em>new</em> pattern on the re-slices since they'll already be inheriting the pattern from the original slice.  It <em>should</em> be allowed, but SUSHI <em>might</em> bark....  If so, let us know.</p>",
