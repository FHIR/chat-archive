The <code>se-baseprofile</code> IG does indicate its IG URI, so we can use the shorter syntax for that one.</li>\n<li>The <code>hl7.fhir.no.basis</code> package has no <code>ImplementationGuide</code> resource in it, and I couldn't find the URI, so I just made it be the canonical for the IG.  I'm not sure if the IG Publisher will like this, but SUSHI likes it just fine.</li>\n<li>The 2.0.14 version of <code>hl7.fhir.no.basis</code> downloaded just fine for me (you do not need to revert to 2.0.10 -- unless that's what you actually <em>want</em>).</li>\n<li>It appears that the <code>se-baseprofile</code> hasn't yet published an official version (not even 0.0.1), so we actually need to use the <code>current</code> version (which is always the latest autobuild of the IG).</li>\n</ul>",
