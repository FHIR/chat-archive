And then you can directly set values on this Instance of <code>CodeSystem</code> as if you were setting values on an Instance of any other resource. Note that I have to set a lot of metadata in the first 7 lines that is automatically set when using the <code>CodeSystem</code> keyword, and I don't have access to the nice syntax available when using the <code>CodeSystem</code> keyword to set concepts. But it is possible.</p>",

For example, given <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"239822\">@Nick Freiter</span>'s excellent example above, would SUSHI do the right thing if you specified a code somewhere else in the IG using <code>YogaCS2#Sirsasana</code>?  I'm not sure.  But it <em>should</em> -- so it's good to try these things out!</p>",
