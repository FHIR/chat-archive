        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"203235\">@Ward Weistra</span> -- that sounds reasonable.  To be honest, I'm unfamiliar with canonical-less packages.  In cases like this, what <em>is</em> the <code>uri</code> for the package?  Is it just an arbitrary URI chosen by the author/publisher?</p>\n<p>We'll have to figure out how we want this to work though.  In the config.yaml, it's currently key/value pairs:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>dependencies:\n  nictiz.fhir.nl.stu3.zib2017: 1.3.10\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>If you used a <code>uri</code> instead of <code>packageId</code> as the key in that pair, we could probably detect it is a <code>uri</code> and treat it accordingly -- but then we don't have the <code>packageId</code> anymore -- and I'm not sure if we can look it up by that URI (since it's not the canonical one, but perhaps you know better?).  So we could support a more advanced mode for those who need it:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>dependencies:\n  nictiz.fhir.nl.stu3.zib2017:\n    uri: http://my.uri.org/fhir/ImplementationGuide/foo\n    version: 1.3.10\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>",
