        "content": "<p>You can use a string to set xhtml values. Specifically it may be easiest to use a multiline string, which starts and ends with <code>\"\"\"</code>, as shown in this example:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>* text.div = &quot;&quot;&quot;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot;\n&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;Title of document&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;body&gt;\nsome content\n&lt;/body&gt;\n\n&lt;/html&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>One thing to be wary of is indentation. Experimenting with this has made me realize that SUSHI has a bug that will cause the beginning of a non-indented line to be chopped off if the same multiline string contains indented lines. So for now if you can just keep everything non-indented, multiline strings should work, and we will fix that bug soon.</p>",
