It is mentioned here but not explained (<a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/overview.html\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/overview.html</a>). I have been studying the mCode IG (<a href=\"https://github.com/HL7/fhir-mCODE-ig\">https://github.com/HL7/fhir-mCODE-ig</a>) and see that there is a ruleset</p>\n<p>RuleSet: BundleEntry(name, min, max, short, def, class)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>entry contains {name} {min}..{max} MS</li>\n<li>entry[{name}] ^short = \"{short}\"</li>\n<li>entry[{name}] ^definition = \"{def}\"</li>\n<li>entry[{name}].resource only {class}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That appears to be using an OperationDefinition to create a Bundle that contains all of the resources needed to represent a cancer patient. I would like to do something similar for the Phenopackets IG (<a href=\"https://github.com/phenopackets/core-ig\">https://github.com/phenopackets/core-ig</a>) but cannot find documentation/tutorial material.</p>",

Is that what you really mean?  Or do you mean to ask about <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/reference.html#parameterized-rule-sets\">Parameterized RuleSets</a>?  If the latter, then checkout that link.  You can also see some examples on <a href=\"https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/\">FSH Online</a> if you click \"FSH Examples\", then \"Rule Sets\" --&gt; \"Parameterized\".</p>\n<p>If you really are wanting to define a FHIR OperationDefinition resource instance, then I don't have any examples of that on hand, but you would probably use the parameterized ruleset approach to reduce as much boilerplate as you can.</p>",
