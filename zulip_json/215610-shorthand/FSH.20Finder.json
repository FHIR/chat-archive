If you know of an IG using FSH that you think should be listed but isn't, <a href=\"https://github.com/FSHSchool/fsh-finder/issues/new/choose\">please open an issue on GitHub</a>. Updates will be ~weekly (until automated regeneration is set up), so if you register for <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org\">build.fhir.org</a> it may take a bit for your IG to appear here.</p>\n<p>FSH Finder also attempts to determine how FSH is being used (defining profiles, instances, OperationDefinitions, StructureDefinitions) using the GitHub Search API, which is only available for the default branch on the repo.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you have any questions or run into bugs. Thanks!<br>\n<a href=\"user_uploads/10155/euOgQ4nKzXYpV7ksV4lW7Lk3/9F13CEAD-31BC-4233-B117-93BBF878AC3B.png\">Screenshot</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/10155/euOgQ4nKzXYpV7ksV4lW7Lk3/9F13CEAD-31BC-4233-B117-93BBF878AC3B.png\" title=\"Screenshot\"><img src=\"user_uploads/10155/euOgQ4nKzXYpV7ksV4lW7Lk3/9F13CEAD-31BC-4233-B117-93BBF878AC3B.png\"></a></div>",
