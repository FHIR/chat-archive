We've just done a few tests with codes containing <code>.</code>, and in our experience, it has worked without needing quotes.  For example, I was able to successfully add the following code to a <code>ValueSet</code> definition:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>* ICD10#U07.1 &quot;2019-nCoV Acute Respiratory Disease&quot;\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>We also tested this for codes when defining <code>CodeSystem</code>s.</p>\n<p>Regarding mCODE, I've let <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191447\">@Mark Kramer</span> know about the missing <code>.</code> in ICD codes in mCODE value sets.</p>",
