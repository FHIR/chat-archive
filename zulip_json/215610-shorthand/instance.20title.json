For <code>Instance:</code>, the <code>Title:</code> is only used in the IG metadata to give the instance a title when it is listed on the artifact page.  We do not apply it to the instance's <code>title</code> element itself because not all instances have a <code>title</code> element -- so it might be confusing to have the behavior differ depending on the instance type.  In addition, there is no guarantee that a <code>title</code> element has a particular semantic meaning (although it seems unlikely to differ).</p>\n<p>I think that populating <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> in instances is something we can reconsider.  It could potentially be a configurable option.  I'll add a backlog item for us to consider this.</p>",
