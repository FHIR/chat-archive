By definition, these only contain the data that is <em>different</em> from the parent.  So I would not expect to see the label in the child profile (since it is not different from the parent).  If you run SUSHI with the <code>-s</code> flag, which includes the <code>snapshot</code> elements, you'll see that SUSHI <em>does</em> put the label into the snapshot of the child profile.</p>\n<p>If you're finding that the label is not in the child profile after running the SUSHI definitions (w/ differentials only) through the IG Publisher, then that may be a bug in the IG Publisher's snapshot generation (unless for some reason they intentionally do not carry over the label from parent to child).</p>",
