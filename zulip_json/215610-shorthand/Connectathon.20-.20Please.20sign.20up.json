This is my first FHIR Connectathon and I want to learn and observe. I don't know if you were asking us to edit the confluence page; I don't think I have access to do that.</p>\n<p>I'll attend the intro/training sessions on Friday (I'm booked Thur morning unfortunately). If there's an opportunity that I could help contribute, I'll do so. We still use DSTU2, and so I'd like to create IG using DSTU2 and Sushi. We have implementations of about 15 services and ultimately I'd like to document them all in Fish and Sushi.</p>",

I wasn't quite sure if I was doing something wrong or if it just wasn't supported. I had gone to the lengths of cloning the repo to prepare to dig in and see if I could add support for DSTU2, but I don't know what I don't know, so...yeah...could be dragons there :)</p>",
