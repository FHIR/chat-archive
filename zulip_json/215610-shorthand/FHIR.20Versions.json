SUSHI only supports R4, if it used to work on earlier versions of FHIR, that was not by design but just a result of the earlier version being similar enough to R4 for things to mostly work. But, we didn't want to give people the impression that it was safe to use SUSHI on versions other than R4 and expect correct output. So we made it explicit in SUSHI that it should only be used on R4.</p>",
