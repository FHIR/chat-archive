        "content": "<p>Fantastic work by the SUSHI and FSH team!  I do have a question/concern and it mostly relates to the integration of SUSHI with the CI IG publisher build framework.  I'm unsure how the build gets the SUSHI, but I thought that did a npm install from scratch each time.  That would appear to me that the CI builds will be using SUSHI 2.0.0?   If that's true, then some of the breaking changes might affect our guides.  I don't see any of the breaking changes affecting me but I'm raising this in case others might need to know.</p>",

I don't think that the IG Publisher renders the mappings (at least it doesn't seem that it has for US Core) -- so at that point you're having to look in the StructureDefinition JSON or XML source to see the mappings.  Which is also something to consider since you said that you \"want to show the field level mapping in the IG\".  As far as I know, if you want that to be surfaced in the user-facing documentation, you might have to manually author your own pages w/ that information.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> -- is there any way to programmatically render SD mappings in an IG?</p>\n<p>There is also <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/structuremap.html\">StructureMap</a> but that is an entirely different beast.</p>",
