If I had to guess, I suspect that SUSHI is trying to enumerate the reference type targets to see what are the allowed reference targets -- but maybe the reference doesn't list the targets since it basically supports <em>all</em> targets.  It's just a guess -- and there's nothing <em>you</em> could do about that -- but we'll look into it!</p>",
