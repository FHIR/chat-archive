The only way that SUSHI generates a snapshot is if you explicitly tell it to via the <code>-s</code> or <code>--snapshot</code> flag.  Assuming you're not using that, then it is the IG Publisher that is generating that snapshot.  This <em>sounds</em> like an IG Publisher issue to me, but if you're able to include a snippet of FSH that reproduces this, we can look into it further (as it <em>could</em> be a SUSHI issue).</p>",
