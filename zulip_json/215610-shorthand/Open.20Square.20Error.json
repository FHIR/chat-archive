You might want to try running <code>_updatePublisher.bat</code> to make sure you have the latest publisher version.  When I run <code>genonce</code>, it tells me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>FHIR IG Publisher Version 1.1.72 (Git# 381475ffeb1b). Built 2021-05-14T21:21:20.332Z (9 days old)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you have the latest publisher and it's still doing that, then it might be related to what template you're using (indicated in <code>ig.ini</code>).  For my test I was just using: <code>template = fhir.base.template#current</code>.</p>\n<p>If you continue to have problems, I would suggest posting in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179252\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation\">#IG creation</a> -- as this seems to be an issue w/ the publisher and/or templating system, not FSH or SUSHI.   You'll likely get better help over there.</p>",
