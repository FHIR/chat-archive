You'll notice that if you add something along the lines of:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>* telecom ^slicing.discriminator.type = #value\n* telecom ^slicing.discriminator.path = &quot;system&quot;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>the error should go away. But, the <code>discriminator</code> has cardinality <code>0..1</code>, so we should not be assuming it exists, and you should not be required to add the two lines shown above, so this is a bug we will fix. Thanks for the find!</p>",
