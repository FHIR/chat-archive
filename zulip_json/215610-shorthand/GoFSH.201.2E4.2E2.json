In past versions of GoFSH, if the name contained one or more path separators, it was possible to cause GoFSH to write the FSH file to other locations on the filesystem. This behavior could be abused to intentionally overwrite existing FSH files on the system. The utility of leveraging this bug, however, is limited by the fact that the file extension will always be <code>.fsh</code> and the file contents will always be FHIR Shorthand.  In this version of GoFSH, the bug has been fixed by properly sanitizing file names before writing them to disk.</p>\n<p><strong>Install or Update</strong></p>\n<p>To install or update to this release, run the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>$ npm install -g gofsh\n</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>More Information</strong></p>\n<p>For more details on this release, see the <a href=\"https://github.com/FHIR/GoFSH/releases/tag/v1.4.2\">GoFSH 1.4.2 Release Notes</a>.</p>",
