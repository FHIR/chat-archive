It confuses the usefulness of the IG as a resource you might have on your server, with something used to generate the IG publication. My personal expectation had been that is that if a parameter (or any part of the IG resource) isn't something that is useful to downstream consumers, it doesn't belong in the resource. But I was recently surprised by all the temporarily-useful parameter values put into the resource.)</p>",
