In theory, the SUSHI 0.13.x releases should produce an initial <code>config.yaml</code> file that produces the same output as SUSHI 0.12.7.  It sounds like your experience is different than that.  I'd like to understand why.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Did you edit <code>config.yaml</code> after SUSHI 0.13.x created it?</li>\n<li>Did you delete <code>ig-data</code> or any files in <code>ig-data</code> since upgrading to 0.13.x</li>\n<li>Does the <code>config.yaml</code> file have <code>FSHOnly</code> set?  If so, to what?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If this is a public project, please send us the GitHub URL and we can take a look.</p>\n<p>If you need to roll back to SUSHI 0.12.x, you can run <code>npm install -g fsh-sushi@0.12.7</code> -- but we would still appreciate your help in identifying what's wrong with 0.13.x so we can fix it!</p>",
