It does not validate anything having to do with fhirpath (constraints, slices, etc), nor does it do full conformance checking on profiles.  We definitely recommend validating your instances using a proper validator after SUSHI exports them.  Since SUSHI is usually used alongside the IG Publisher (which does validation), we made the intentional decision not to invest time and resources in re-inventing that wheel.</p>",
