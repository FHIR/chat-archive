From what I've seen, it seems like maybe it's common for _name_ to be Capitalized (and either PascalCase or using <code>_</code>) and id to be lowercase with dashes (<code>-</code>).  That said, I haven't surveyed tons of IGs, so it could just be the IGs I've been looking at.</p>",

In SUSHI/FSH, if you don't specify an <code>id</code>, we used the <code>name</code> as the default <code>id</code>.  I guess we'll need to update that code to replace <code>_</code> with <code>-</code> in the <code>id</code> when we do that.</p>",
