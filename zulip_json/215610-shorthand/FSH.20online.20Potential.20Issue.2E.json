        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"193364\">@Al Pivonka</span>.  Interesting find.  It turns out that you actually have invalid FSH in your source, but SUSHI doesn't complain about it.  It ends up generating invalid JSON.  Which, when converted back to FSH, causes problems.</p>\n<p>The issue is that in your <code>Instance</code>, you are setting <code>value[x]</code> to values, like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>* item[0].extension[GeneralSettings].extension[title].value[x] = &quot;The Title&quot;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>But in <code>Instance</code>s, you must use the fully typed version of choice properties.  So this really should be:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>* item[0].extension[GeneralSettings].extension[title].valueString = &quot;The Title&quot;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you change them all to be like that, it goes much more smoothly.  The round-trip still doesn't look exactly like the original source, but it is actually the same (just a different way of doing it).  Here's the fixed up version: <a href=\"https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/share/3KjFyoJ\">https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/share/3KjFyoJ</a></p>",
