Still, I expect that 1.0.2 would not cause any problems as long as you keep the project structure in the pre-1.0 layout.  There are only specific template requirements if you also change your project structure to use <code>input/fsh</code>.  If you get a chance, I'd recommend you at least try 1.0.2 to see if it causes any issues.  I expect that it won't.</p>",
