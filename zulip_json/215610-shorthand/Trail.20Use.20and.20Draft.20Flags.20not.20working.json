I am getting the extension now in the structure definition, so that part is working.  But was hoping it would surface in the IG UI where developers can see it, similar to what occurs with the MS flag.  The HL7 IG has those, but I suppose it is all about the JEKYLL template used to build the IG.  I guess to get it working as I'm expecting, I need to figure out how to customize the template jekyll pages to display that??</p>",
