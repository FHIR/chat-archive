Version 1.9.0 now offers auto completion for paths when writing rules on a Profile, Extension, Logical, or Resource. Note that auto complete suggestions are made based on the snapshot of the parent resource, thus elements added by an AddElementRule or constrained by an OnlyRule  will not have these changes reflected in autocomplete results. Also note that support for caret paths is not available at this time. </p>\n<p>Special thanks to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"242620\">@Mint Thompson</span>  for working so hard to bring this feature to light! If you would like to add the extension to your VS Code environment, you can do so by clicking the Extensions button from the sidebar on the left and searching for “FHIR Shorthand”, or by following <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MITRE-Health.vscode-language-fsh&amp;ssr=false#overview\">this link</a>.</p>",
