Since <code>sushi-config.yaml</code> supports all of the ImplementationGuide resource, however, there are a lot of optional properties -- some of which are complex.  I might want to try to strike a balance where we include some optional properties, but maybe not all -- and provide a commented link to the documentation.  What do you think of that, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191401\">@Eric Haas</span>?</p>",

We've implemented your suggestion in <a href=\"https://github.com/FHIR/sushi/releases/tag/v2.2.0\">SUSHI 2.2.0</a>.  If you install that and run <code>sushi --init</code> you'll see a more complete started <code>sushi-config.yaml</code>.  Thanks for the feedback!</p>",
