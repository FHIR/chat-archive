As far as I recall, assigning a <code>uri</code> by an instance ID is not defined by the FHIR Shorthand spec.  It would be an interesting thing to consider though!</p>\n<p>So, I'm afraid you'll just have to do via normal string assignment, e.g.:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>* action[=].action.definitionUri = &quot;ActivityDefinition/PULSE&quot;\n</code></pre></div>",
