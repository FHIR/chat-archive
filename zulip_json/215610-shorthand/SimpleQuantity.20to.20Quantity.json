        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"314831\">@Osaid Nabulsi</span> -- one of the rules about creating profiles in FHIR is that you can only constrain things to be narrower.  For example, if something has cardinality 0..1, you can constrain it to 1..1 because that is narrower than 0..1, but you cannot constrain it to 0..2 because that is wider (e.g., there are values in 0..2 that would not fit into the original 0..1 cardinality).</p>\n<p>This applies to types as well.  SimpleQuantity constrains normal Quantity by applying more rules/requirements to it.  So... you cannot replace SimpleQuantity with Quantity because Quantity is \"wider\" than SimpleQuantity.  You can only replace SimpleQuantity with a type that constrains SimpleQuantity further.</p>\n<p>It can be a hard concept to explain.  Hopefully I have explained it ok.</p>",
