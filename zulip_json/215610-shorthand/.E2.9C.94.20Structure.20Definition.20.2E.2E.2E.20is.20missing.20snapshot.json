Snapshot is required for import.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>What do I need to run sushi without any problems? Do you have advise for me? <br>\nThanks in advance to everyone contributing.</p>",

The latest release of Firely Teminal has a \"bake\" functionality in there that automatically generates snapshots for all the packages you want to install. You can install Firely Terminal easily on your command line <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/downloads/firely-terminal\">https://simplifier.net/downloads/firely-terminal</a></p>\n<p>The benefit of using Firely Terminal to generate the snapshots is that you always use the latest version of the .NET SDK snapshot generator.</p>",

As a start, we plan to provide detailed documentation on how to use the Firely Terminal to satisfy the requirements of SUSHI. Eventually it would be nice to support it in a seamless fashion, but we're still working out the technical details regarding how something like that might work.</p>",
