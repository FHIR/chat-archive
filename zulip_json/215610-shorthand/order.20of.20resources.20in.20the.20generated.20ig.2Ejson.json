        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191415\">@Giorgio Cangioli</span>.  Thanks for reporting this.  I've just tested it in SUSHI and confirmed that the order you declare resources in the <code>sushi-config.yaml</code> does <em>NOT</em> affect the order of the resource list in the generated ImplementationGuide resource.  I think we can fix this, but it does raise a question...</p>\n<p>In <code>sushi-config.yaml</code>, you do not have to specify the full resource list; you're allowed to list only the resources you want to \"override\" metadata values for -- in which case the rest of the resources retain their default inferred metadata values.  So... what should SUSHI do if there are 15 resources in the IG, but only 2 resources are listed in <code>sushi-config.yaml</code>?  Should it change the overall resource order and put those two resources <em>first</em>, and then follow them with the rest alphabetically?  What if you want to override the values but don't want to mess with the order?  One approach would be that if the author wants to specify a particular order, they must list <em>all</em> the resources in <code>sushi-config.yaml</code>.  On one hand, that could be tedious, but on the other hand, if an author cares about order, wouldn't they want to order <em>all</em> the resources anyway?</p>\n<p>Wondering what you think about this.</p>",

In the case that only <em>some</em> resources are enumerated, I don't think it makes sense to order some of the resources using user-defined order and the rest using system-defined order.
