We're still trying to determine how best to handle this -- and whether it should address this exact situation or be more general.  One thing we're considering is making it so that you have to use a URL (or an alias to a URL) to refer to any external entity.  If we go with that, we need to determine how best to combine that w/ allowing the user to specify their own slicename (when referencing an external extension).  We also need to figure out what to do w/ base FHIR resources, because I doubt people want to reference Observation as <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Observation</code> -- but we also know there are people who want to name their profiles the same as the resource they profile (e.g., a <code>Patient</code> profile named <code>Patient</code>), so we need to support that too.</p>",
