Not sure where the problem is, but suddenly when I run the firely c# Snapshot generator on a sushi output'd profile, I am getting a snapshot with zero elements in it, even though the differential is populated. Not sure why this is just happening, 'cause I didn't upgrade sushi nor the c# toolkit (Firely). I upgraded sushi to latest and still see issue. Immediately ring any bells?</p>",
