That's why you see it trying to find <code>hl7.fhir.r5.core#4.1.0</code>.  We will need to update SUSHI to special-case <code>4.1.x</code> as R4B. In the mean time, if you want to <em>hack</em> it, you could probably get away w/ renaming <code>hl7.fhir.r4b.core#4.1.0</code> to <code>hl7.fhir.r5.core#4.1.0</code> so SUSHI can find it.  Not a good long-term solution, but might fill the gap until we fix it in SUSHI.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> -- do we know what the version number of the <em>final</em> R4B will be?  I'd like SUSHI to be aware of that too, but it's hard to predict given that there is already a <code>4.2.0</code> out there.</p>",
