The one case where something <em>like</em> this might be intentional is with RuleSets -- in which a RuleSet might assign something to a property, but then a further rule (after the Rule Set is inserted) chooses to override it.   Since RuleSets are intended to be re-used across multiple definitions, there are cases where that might be desirable.  But even so, the exact situation in your example is almost always a mistake.  I'll add an issue to our project to consider flagging this as a warning.</p>",
