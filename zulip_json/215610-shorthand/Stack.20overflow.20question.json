The question is basically <strong>How can I profile DetectedIssue so that mitigation is required <em>if</em> the status is final?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Any constraints that depend on relationships between elements (like <code>status</code> and <code>mitigation</code>) can only be constrained using an invariant.  Invariants are set on <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/elementdefinition-definitions.html#ElementDefinition.constraint\">ElementDefinition.constraint</a> in FHIR, but FSH has a special mechanism for invariants <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/reference.html#defining-invariants\">documented here</a>.  The most difficult thing about invariants is that they use another language, called FHIRPath, to express the constraint.  You should look at the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhirpath/N1/\">core FHIRPath</a> documentation as well as the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/fhirpath.html\">FHIR-specific FHIRPath documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>For your specific example, you would first define your invariant.  The special FHIRPath expression is in the Expression field:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Invariant:   final-mitigation\nDescription: &quot;If DetectedIssue.status is final, then DetectedIssue.mitigation must be present&quot;\nExpression:  &quot;status = &#39;final&#39; implies mitigation.exists()&quot;\nSeverity:    #error\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Then, since it talks about two elements, relative to the root of the resource, you add a top-level obeys rule to your profile that brings in the invariant you just created:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>* obeys final-mitigation\n</code></pre></div>",
