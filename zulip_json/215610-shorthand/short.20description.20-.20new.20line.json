If you find yourself writing enough that you need newlines, maybe the <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/elementdefinition-definitions.html#ElementDefinition.definition\">definition</a> element would be a better place for that description? Newlines in that element _will_ be rendered by the IG Publisher.</p>",
