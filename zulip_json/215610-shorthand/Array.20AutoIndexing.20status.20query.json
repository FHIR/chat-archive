        "content": "<p>Mark, here is what MFSH (Macro FSH) currently does.<br>\nLets talk about this and see what parts make sense to move into FSH.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Macros</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Macros are inserts with the following additions.<br>\na) Named parameters.<br>\n   When the macro is defined, named parameters are defined. When called, each of those<br>\n   parameters must contain a value.<br>\n   #macro XXYYZ(alpha, beta, delta)<br>\n   #apply XXYYZ(\"alpha value\", \"beta value\", \"delta value\")<br>\n   Anywhere in the code that 'alpha' is found, it is replaced with 'alpha value'.<br>\nb) Global parameters.<br>\n   There are parameters that are defined globally, such as</p>\n<p>- the id of the current profile<br>\n   - the url of the current profile.<br>\n   - parameters that can be set on command line<br>\n   many others<br>\n   These can be referenced in any macro just as if it was a named parameter.</p>\n<p>c) Redirection<br>\n   The output of a macro can be redirected to a non-fsh file.<br>\n   The output file name can contain global and named parameters which will get expanded when the macro is called/executed (not when it is<br>\n   first defined)<br>\n   I use this to collate info such as node graph commands I process externalluy to generate svg images, and also to allow embedded<br>\n   macros to generate the --intro implementation guide files for each profile.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>   #macro XXYYZ() &gt; &#39;redirection path&#39;\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>d) Once flags<br>\n   The once flag allows a macro to be called only once, even if it is executed multiple times.<br>\n   Example of how this can be used:<br>\n   Several macros are defined that add distinct sliced Observation.component items. These macros are sometimes used in a profile together, and<br>\n   in some profiles separately.<br>\n   Each macro calls a common macro to add component slicing; this should only be called once per profile.<br>\n   One way to handle this is to force the user to call this macro separately, once per profile, but this requires the user to<br>\n   manually add this and allows opportunities to not call it.<br>\n   So a macro is defined that implements the required slicing commands, and it is called with the once flag set, so it <br>\n   only generates FSH output the first time it is called.<br>\n   There are two flavors of the once flag.</p>\n<p>- restrict calls to once per profile<br>\n   - restrict the calls to once period.<br>\n   Named Parameters can be a problem here, as multiple calls can be made with difference named parameter values, and only<br>\n   the first call will create output with its unique parameter values.</p>\n<p>// this is expanded once per profile.<br>\n    #macro once XXYYZ()<br>\n    #end</p>\n<p>// this is expanded once, no matter how many times it is called.<br>\n    #apply once XXYYZ()</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Fragments</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A fragment is kinda a cross between a profile and a macro.<br>\nThe purpose of a fragment is to define a profile fragment that <br>\n  a) can be added to multiple profiles (like a macro)<br>\n  b) is intended to signal to code generators that each fragment can be treated like a separate 'thing' (class or interface).<br>\n  c) breaks the output profile into separate pieces that are functionally unique, implemented in multiple profiles, and documented as separate 'thing'.</p>\n<p>Example.<br>\n  I create a fragment 'f' that is three Observation.component items.<br>\n  I include the fragment in multiple profiles 'a', 'b', and 'c'.</p>\n<p>I generate a c# project that implements a class to process these profiles.<br>\n  I can generate a method 'm' that can accept an interface 'f' that mimics the fragment 'f'.<br>\n  Classes are created that mimic profiles 'a', 'b', and 'c', each of which implements interface 'f'.<br>\n  I can call method 'm' with an instance of 'a', 'b', or 'c'.</p>\n<p>So a fragment is a part of a profile that is to be implemented in multiple profiles but treated like a 'distinct' item<br>\nin generated artifacts (including implementation guide).</p>\n<p>The fragment would have a parent class (like Observation).<br>\nIt should generate an item in the implementation guide showing exactly what it implemented.<br>\nIt should generate documentation in the documentation guide indicating what profiles implement it.</p>\n<p>A profile can include one or more fragments just like a macro.<br>\nNo named parameters are allowed in a fragment call.</p>\n<p>The fragments generate structure definition and other meta data allowing external code generation tools to recognize<br>\nwhen a fragment has been defined, and where it is used. Programming artifacts can be generated from this info.</p>\n<p>#Fragment: Observation.Component.NotPreviouslySeenFragment<br>\n#Parent: Observation<br>\n#Title: \"NotPreviously Seen Fragment\"<br>\n#Description: \"\"\"</p>\n<h1>Adds NotPreviously Seen Component slice.</h1>\n<h1>\"\"\"</h1>\n<p>#apply Observation.Component.Add(\"notPreviouslySeen\", \"0..*\", \"Not Previously Seen\", \"Not Previously Seen\",<br>\n  # \"\"\"<br>\n  # This slice contains the optional components that define prevous encounters in which this abnormality was not seen.<br>\n  # The value of this component is a codeable concept chosen from the NotPreviouslySeenVS valueset.<br>\n  # \"\"\",<br>\n  #   \"ObservationComponentSliceCodesCS#notPreviouslySeen\")<br>\n  #<br>\n  #apply Observation.Component.SetConcept(\"notPreviouslySeen\", \"1..1\", \"NotPreviouslySeenVS\")<br>\n#end</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Conditional compilation</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This is completely experimental and I have not found it to be useful so far, but there may be instances where it may become useful.<br>\nThis is identical to conditional compilation in c++, c3, etc.<br>\nWe may want to ignore adding this to FSH.
