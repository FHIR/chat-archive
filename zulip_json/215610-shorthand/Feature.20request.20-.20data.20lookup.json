If I create an Excel script that takes a list of parameters and generates 500 resources from it, and I check that in to my Guide so that other committers of my guide can use it, you're now telling me that is verboten because I've \"locked a designer into a single approach\".  That's just not a reasonable position to take.  You're telling me that Grahame is going to add some code to the publisher and we're going to add some extensions that are purely for pre-assembly of resource instances?  That is so not in the purview of what the publisher should be doing.  It should be incumbent on the spec writers to provide those resource instances in some means.  And if that is using a homebaked Excel script or using a feature that SUSHI might incorporate or if it means hand-writing them, that should be up to the spec writer and definitely not something required of the publishing tooling stack.</p>\n<p>Now, if SUSHI required the publishing tooling stack to do something specific so that one of its features could be used, that is when I would agree with you.  But as long as SUSHI or Forge or whatever tool you use, ends up producing the proper inputs, it should not and can not matter how it does it.</p>",

What do we say about all of those interactive questionnaire designers that don't have any input files, and output Questionnaire resources heavily annotated with private extensions? Should they be verboten too? Is FSH the design tool, or an input format? If it's an input format, why isn't there pressure to support it in Forge? How do we decide which features a tool is allowed to differentiate and show value with, and which features are the common base level? Should we say Sushi should be banned until goFSH is capable of ingesting any IG and allowing you to move from/away the Sushi/goFSH combo with full fidelity? Can I develop a process that uses Adobe Illustrator or Microsoft Visio to generate images instead of plantUML? As long as the output is SVG should it matter?</p>\n<p>As a user, I'd like the ability to move my content from one toolchain to another, and I'd be ticked to find out that I'm stuck in a tool because of a choice I made. But portability should be value that the tool author adds, not a requirement of HL7 on anyone who builds a tool.</p>\n<p>I feel strange arguing against interoperability, but we already have an interoperable layer: the IG resources. I don't know that we need--or more correctly, that HL7 should mandate---to move interoperability up the chain.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I'm not saying that's strictly verboten, but it is problematic - at least for HL7-maintained IGs.  You've now introduced a custom tool into the maintenance process for that IG.  If you quit working for the committee or get hit by a bus, HL7 is now on the hook for figuring out what the heck you did and how to maintain it and make necessary changes to put out a new release.  Granted, there are going to be new requirements and tight timelines that lead to short-term cobbled-together solutions that do whatever's needed for the initial release.  However, over time, there needs to be some thought about how to incorporate that into a general purpose solution that's part of the framework, understood by most authors and that we don't have 10 different ways of accomplishing the same thing across most IGs.  I don't think that \"coming together timeline\" is necessarily in the weeks or even months - i.e. going forth and trying stuff is cool.  But as an organization we do have to be sensitive to long-term maintainability, durability of tooling stack and consistency of published artifacts.  </p>\n<p>It may be that the outcome of that discussion is \"spreadsheets are fine, this is the macro we're going to use, here's the Git project we're going to maintain it on, and these are the minimum two people who will take on responsibility for keeping it current.  And FSH could fall in the same boat.  \"For certain functions, the only way to make it happen is to use FSH\", meaning no need for extensions, no support from other authoring tools.  But that's not a choice that should be made just by the FSH community or just by a particular IG developer.  For short-term experimentation, sure.  But for long-term maintenance, we need to ensure the organization is comfortable with the dependencies we have and that we're also creating an environment that's conducive to multiple authoring environments that can share inputs and produce consistent outputs.  All our eggs in one basket has proved to be problematic in the past.  Maybe for some functions the number of eggs is small enough that one basket is fine.  Being able to generate large volumes of example instances seems like something that will involve a large number of eggs (i.e. it'll be a requirement for lots of IGs.)</p>",
