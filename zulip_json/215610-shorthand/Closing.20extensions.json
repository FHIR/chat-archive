NOTE: You have to declare those two to be 0..0 everywhere you haven't already defined an extension since extensions can appear anywhere.  Datatypes can have extensions, every field in your resource can have extensions, every field inherited by your resource can have extensions, etc.  That's a lot of places to declare extensions off-limit.<br>\nd) this is still a really bad idea</p>",
