The best you can do is declare that structure as a parent and then you <em>inherit</em> the constraints.</p>\n<p>If you want the same constraints as a structure that is <em>not</em> in your inheritance tree, I think you'll have to redefine them in your own structure.  You do this by <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/reference.html#defining-invariants\">defining the invariant</a> and then applying it via an <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/reference.html#obeys-rules\">obeys rule</a>.</p>\n<p>Because of the way FSH works, you can define an invariant once in FSH and apply it in multiple places -- but this isn't really the way standard FHIR works since invariants are inlined in the StructureDefinition.</p>",
