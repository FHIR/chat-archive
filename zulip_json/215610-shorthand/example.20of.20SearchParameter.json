        "content": "<p>Ah... you mean just the science of writing a <code>SearchParameter</code> in general?  Yeah, I agree, there is not a lot of documentation I can find that addresses that directly.  I think having a solid understanding of how search works (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html\">documented here</a>) helps, along w/ the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/searchparameter.html\">SearchParameter resource documentation</a>.  But after that, you still need to connect a lot of the dots on your own.  For me, I find it most helpful just to look at a lot of definitions and learn by example.  There is a page called <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/searchparameter-registry.html\">Defined Search Parameters</a> that lists all of the search parameters in the whole FHIR spec.  One nice thing about this page is that it has a link near the top to download all the definitions as a FHIR Bundle (XML or JSON) -- so you can also see how each search parameter is actually defined.</p>\n<p>Other than that, I don't have any other guidance, but perhaps someone else does.</p>",
