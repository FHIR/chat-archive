Since <code>http://fhir.de/StructureDefinition/CodingICD10GM</code> is a profile on <code>Coding</code>, then I think one approach would be:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>* code.coding only http://fhir.de/StructureDefinition/CodingICD10GM\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If SUSH says it cannot find that definition then I would double-check to make sure that it really is defined in one of your dependency IGs (paying attention to version as well).  Because if it is in a dependency IG, then I think it should work.</p>\n<p>That said, that will require every instance of <code>Coding</code> to match the profile.  If you only want to require that at least one <code>Coding</code> matches the profile, you'd have to create an open <code>slicing</code> and declare one slice that is restricted to that profile.</p>",

I noticed that in the profile on <code>Coding</code> that you are wanting to use, it fixes <code>system</code> to: <code>http://fhir.de/CodeSystem/dimdi/icd-10-gm</code>, so that is presumably what you'd want before the <code>#</code> when fixing that code.</p>",

I checked the contents of the package and the IG itself says its version is 1.0.0-alpha1, but the same problem persists if I tell sushi to use that version instead.<br>\nI can derive a profile from that uri like this</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Profile: MyProfile\nParent: http://fhir.de/StructureDefinition/CodingICD10GM\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>and the generator and sushi don't complain, but the link on the IG website to that profile goes to <code>../output/null</code>.</p>\n<p>I am using snapshots downloaded manually like we discussed in the \"Dependencies\" thread. When I check the package, it does include this uri (<a href=\"http://fhir.de/StructureDefinition/CodingICD10GM\">http://fhir.de/StructureDefinition/CodingICD10GM</a>) in a separate file. The json file with the IG itself doesn't seem to contain this URI though. Should the IG (in this case, <code>basisprofil-de-r4.json</code>) contain a reference to it somewhere? It just seems to refer to a bunch of markdown files. If it should, I guess that is the problem</p>",

SUSHI <em>should</em> be able to find it as long as its formal JSON definition is available in the IG package.  It's also not a problem that the URL doesn't resolve to a valid location in your browser.  While that's generally considered a best practice in FHIR, it is not a requirement and SUSHI does not rely on it.</p>\n<p>If that URL is working as the value of a <code>Parent</code> then I don't know why it's not working as the value of an <code>only</code> rule.  I will have to try to reproduce locally in order to figure out what's going on.</p>",
