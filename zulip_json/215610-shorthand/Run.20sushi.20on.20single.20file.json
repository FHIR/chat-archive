The trouble is that very often one file relies on definitions in other files.  So unless your one file was completely standalone, you'd just end up with <em>more</em> errors related to all the things you rely on from other files.  That said, we could consider adding a filter mechanism that allows you to filter logs based on a regular expression or filename or something like that.  It would still process all the files but only show logs that match the filter you passed in (on the command line).  Would something like that be useful?</p>\n<p>If you really want to compile just one file, I think your best bet is to copy it to FSHOnline and run it there: <a href=\"https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/\">https://fshschool.org/FSHOnline/#/</a></p>",
