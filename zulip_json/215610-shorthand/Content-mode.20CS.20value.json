A fragment, by definition, is a subset of the code system -- so SUSHI cannot automatically provide a count since the total count is unknown to SUSHI (i.e., SUSHI doesn't know how many codes exist <em>outside</em> the fragment).  In this case, if you want the code system to report a count, you must provide the count yourself via a <code>* ^count = {number}</code> rule.</p>",
