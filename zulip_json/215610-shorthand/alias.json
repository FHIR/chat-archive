When you are using <code>=</code> to set a value, SUSHI is going to expect <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, a string, a number, a code, a dateTime, or a time, and <code>systemCPN</code> doesn't match any of those, so we get this input error. The solution here for now would be to just to manually replace the aliased value with the desired string. </p>\n<p>I think this brings up a good point though, we likely need to expand where we allow aliases. I can't think of any good reasons why you shouldn't be able to use an alias here, and the rules for where an alias can and can't probably seem a bit arbitrary.</p>",
