I've tried moving it to \"resources\", but that didn't change. Is there a setting I need to change someplace to get it to look for these types of things?</p>",

Can you check to see if SUSHI is adding it to the <code>ImplementationGuide-{packageId}.json</code> file it generates in <code>fsh-generated/input/resources</code>?</p>\n<p>Also... SUSHI 2.0 will be coming out in the next few weeks, with support for hierarchical code systems, so... you can look forward to that!</p>",
