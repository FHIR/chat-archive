        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"193557\">@Jorge Mansilla</span>.  This question is actually outside the scope of FSH.  The way you would do it in a FSH project is the same as any other IG project (with or without FSH). For that reason, I would suggest posting this question in the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179252\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation\">#IG creation</a> stream instead.</p>\n<p>That said, my understanding is that the HL7 FHIR publication team actually builds and maintains the history page (assuming this is an HL7 IG).  I believe that happens at the time of your first publication (probably a ballot?).  I expect you can get more information over in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179252\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation\">#IG creation</a>.</p>",
