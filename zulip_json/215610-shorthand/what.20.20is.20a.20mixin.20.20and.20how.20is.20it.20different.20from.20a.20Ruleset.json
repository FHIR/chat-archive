So, for example, if you defined a RuleSet called <code>MyAwesomeRuleSet</code>, then you can mix in its rules anywhere in another definition by saying:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>* insert MyAwesomeRuleSet\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This is an improvement because it allows you to determine exactly where the ruleset gets inserted (relative to other rules); whereas the <code>Mixins</code> keyword always inserted them at the beginning of the definition.</p>\n<p>See: <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/reference.html#rule-set-rules\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/reference.html#rule-set-rules</a> (from the current build doc)</p>\n<p>(NOTE: This isn't in the current SUSHI release but should be supported in the next one)</p>",
