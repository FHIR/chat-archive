This is under the assumption that generated narratives weren't a part of the original source -- and that the IG Publisher will re-generate them on build.  GoFSH also does this if the narrative is marked as <code>extensions</code> (since that also means it is generated).  If the status is not <code>generated</code> or <code>extensions</code>, however, GoFSH <em>will</em> decode the narrative into FSH.</p>",
