My thought is to define a rule (in IG 1) and have profiles in IG 1 and 2 insert that rule. Right now it looks like the only way to do this would be to symlink the file IG 1 rule file into the IG 2 project directory.</p>",

Also the fact that sushi doesn't treat the input as separate files, but instead as one bag of content makes it hard. That said, having a \"library\" of rules that could be brought into an IG might be useful.</p>",
