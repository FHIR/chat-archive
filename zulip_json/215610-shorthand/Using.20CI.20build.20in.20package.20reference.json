As that project uses SUSHI it requires the package to contain snaphots, but the auto-ig-publisher does not seem support that. When I check the package in my local cache, it doesn't contain snapshots</p>\n<p>The topic in IG creation (with Grahame) lead to it being a sushi issue. See the topic <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/Generating.20packages.20with.20snapshots\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/Generating.20packages.20with.20snapshots</a></p>\n<p>When I do like this in config.yaml:<br>\ndependencies:<br>\n  hl7.fhir.dk-core.r4:<br>\n    uri: <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7dk/dk-core\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7dk/dk-core</a><br>\n    version: 0.9.1<br>\n... it generates a local cache of the package and it within that I can't find any snapshots. SUSHI complains with the following error: \"Structure Definition <a href=\"http://hl7.dk/fhir/core/StructureDefinition/dk-core-patient\">http://hl7.dk/fhir/core/StructureDefinition/dk-core-patient</a> is missing snapshot. Snapshot is required for import.\"</p>\n<p>I use a profile in this package as parent. Shouldn't that be possible?</p>",
