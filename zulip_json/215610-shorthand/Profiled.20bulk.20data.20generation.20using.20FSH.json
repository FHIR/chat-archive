Could that be done with FSH? I can see how it could be done with the generated JSON, but I'm curious if folks have tried programmatic editing of FSH in bulk, e.g. bringing the Antlr into [insert fave programming language]? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191604\">@Carl Leitner</span></p>",

As long as you declare in the instance which profile the instance is using when you run it through SUSHI it will validate the instances and output the actual FHIR instances.</p>\n<p>That's my understanding at least :-)</p>",

Someone still has to write the code that understands profiles well enough to generate FSH code that conforms to them.  I think that will require some investment.  As <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191362\">@Richard Kavanagh</span> pointed out above, SUSHI does provide some help, in that it does some high-level validation (mainly cardinality and type-checking) -- but it's worth noting that SUSHI does not do <em>full</em> validation.  SUSHI also does help some by automatically setting <em>required</em> fixed values (but it does not do this for optional fixed values).</p>\n<p>Also, in full disclosure, it's worth mentioning that SUSHI currently doesn't perform well with thousands of instances.  I've recently heard of a project with almost 2500 instances that takes SUSHI about 40-45 minutes to chug through.  We'd like to address that and get down to a more reasonable time, but that's where it sits right now.</p>",
