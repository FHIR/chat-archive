If the resource you are creating has <code>name</code> or <code>title</code> or <code>description</code> elements, then you must set them using assignment rules in the Instance, e.g.:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>* name = &quot;MLSTTDB&quot;\n* title = &quot;MLS TTDB&quot;\n</code></pre></div>",
