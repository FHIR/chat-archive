I'm not familiar with those configuration settings, but it looks like you can set them using <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Implementation+Guide+Parameters\">Implementation Guide Parameters</a>.  If that's the case then you set then in your <code>sushi-config.yaml</code> file.  Based on that IG parameters documentation, I believe they'd work out to something like this in <code>sushi-config.yaml</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"YAML\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nt\">parameters</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">validation</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p p-Indicator\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">allow-any-extensions</span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">]</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">extension-domain</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p p-Indicator\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">http</span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">:</span><span class=\"nv\">//example.org</span><span class=\"p p-Indicator\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>For more information on <code>sushi-config.yaml</code>, see the <a href=\"https://fshschool.org/docs/sushi/configuration/\">FSH School SUSHI documentation</a>.</p>",
