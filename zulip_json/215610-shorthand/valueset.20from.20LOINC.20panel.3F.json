You might want to review <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/loinc.html\">Using LOINC with FHIR</a> and if the answer is not there, consider asking on the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179202\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179202-terminology\">#terminology</a> stream.  If someone can tell you how you represent it in the <code>ValueSet</code> resource, we can help you find the right FSH syntax for that.</p>",
