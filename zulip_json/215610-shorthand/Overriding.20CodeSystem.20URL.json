For example, our internal convention is that all canonical URLs are completely lowercase, so rather than: <code>http://example.com/fhir/StructureDefinition/my-practitioner</code>, the URL should be: <code>http://example.com/fhir/structuredefinition/my-practitioner</code>. I realize that I can use a caret rule on each profile definition to accomplish this (or just do some post-processing on the generated artifacts), but it would be nice to be able to set this in the sushi-config.yaml instead.</p>",

We're following common practice, as FHIR Core and most IGs seem to use the pattern w/ capital type names (since type names are generally case-sensitive in the spec).  I recognize that the spec doesn't say you have to do this for canonical URLs (as far as I can tell), but I think I'd want to see some more demand for a feature like this before complicating SUSHI w/ another configuration parameter.</p>\n<p>Are there other people out there who want to use a different canonical URL pattern throughout their IG?</p>",
