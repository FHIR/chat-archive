If you specify a resource (such as an example) in the YAML, it will merge in any values you put there.  So for example, you could do:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nt\">resources</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">Patient/my-example-patient</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">description</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain\">An example Patient</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">Condition/my-example-condition</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">name</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain\">My Example Condition</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">description</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain\">An example Condition</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>As you can see above, it allows you to specify the name or description (or both) and it will merge it into the list with other relevant values.  The example would render this into the IG JSON:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>{\n &quot;reference&quot;: {\n   &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;Patient/my-example-patient&quot;\n  },\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;my-example-patient&quot;,\n  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;An example Patient&quot;,\n  &quot;exampleCanonical&quot;: &quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/sushi-test/StructureDefinition/sample-patient&quot;\n},\n{\n &quot;reference&quot;: {\n   &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;Patient/my-example-condition&quot;\n  },\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;My Example Condition&quot;,\n  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;An example Condition&quot;,\n  &quot;exampleCanonical&quot;: &quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/sushi-test/StructureDefinition/sample-condition&quot;\n}\n</code></pre></div>",
