Since the target of <code>InstanceOf</code> can be <em>anything</em>, there's no guarantee that whatever it is has a place to put <code>title</code> and <code>description</code>.  So, for instances, the <code>Title:</code> and <code>Description:</code> keywords are currently only used when generating the resource list in the IG.  That said, maybe it makes sense that if the <code>InstanceOf:</code> is a conformance or terminology resource that the <code>Title:</code> and <code>Description:</code> should be applied?  I'd buy that.</p>",
