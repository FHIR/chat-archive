As you know, <code>contained</code> has type <code>Resource</code> -- so I suspect that maybe SUSHI would only allow you to set fields that are on <code>Resource</code> (if you defined the contained resources inline in the instance).  We probably need to come up w/ a syntax that would allow the author to indicate a more specific type (than <code>Resource</code>) when doing that.  We also could/should consider allowing authors to define contained resources as separate instances (using <code>Instance:</code> keyword) and then reference them as a contained resource in another instance.</p>",

This reference shows how the contained resource is related to the thing that contains it.  A contained resource that is <em>not</em> referenced at all has no formal relationship to the thing containing it.  People can <em>guess</em> at the relationship, but you really ought to formalize it.  One way to do that, as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"215604\">@Saul Kravitz</span> suggested, is to create an extension that references an <code>InsurancePlan</code> to formally represent the relationship between <code>PractitionerRole</code> and <code>InsurancePlan</code>.</p>\n<p>I'm not very familiar w/ this domain, so my suggestion may not be exactly right (semantically), but here is an example of how you might do this with FSH if you wanted to represent a <code>PractitionerRole</code> that \"accepts\" one or more <code>InsurancePlan</code>s (that you want contained):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Extension: AcceptsInsurancePlan\nId: accepts-insurance-plan\n* value[x] 1..1\n* value[x] only Reference(InsurancePlan)\n\nProfile: MyPractitionerRole\nParent: PractitionerRole\nId: my-practitioner-role\n* contained 1..*\n* contained only InsurancePlan\n* extension contains AcceptsInsurancePlan named accepts 1..*\n</code></pre></div>",
