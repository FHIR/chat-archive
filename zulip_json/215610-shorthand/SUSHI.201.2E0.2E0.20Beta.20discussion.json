We'll fix that.  Thanks for reporting it.  The desired behavior is that if the resource already exists in <code>input/*</code> (based on canonical URL), but there is also a FSH definition for it in <code>input/fsh</code>, then SUSHI should log a warning and _not_ generate the FSH one.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
