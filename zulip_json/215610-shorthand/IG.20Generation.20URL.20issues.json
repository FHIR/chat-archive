I don't think you can do much to affect that (although <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191832\">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> can correct me if I'm wrong).  If you are working on an HL7 IG, then I believe that the HL7 team will do the proper configuration to ensure that canonicals redirect to the real pages upon publication.  If you're publishing on your own somewhere, you may need to put those mechanisms in place yourself if you want canonicals to redirect to their respective pages.  If you dig around a bit in the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179252\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation\">#IG creation</a> stream, I think there are a few threads on this topic.</p>",

So seems I just need to pay attention to change the links in the diagram. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191469\">@Chris Moesel</span>  thanks for the link of the stream.</p>",
