It's open, so please be courteous and don't modify those resources.</p>\n<p>For convenience, I've tagged everything with <code>https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/projects|saner</code>.  I also added the test data security label: <code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActReason|HTEST</code>, so there should be no confusion.</p>\n<p>Since I'm unlikely to make any of the meetings, I thought I'd post here.  That said, if the data needs to be reloaded just ping me.  Cheers!</p>",
