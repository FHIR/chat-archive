So wondered to what extent that touchstone has the ability to cover the possibilities of variation... I presume that Touchstone has a library of testing capability in this space?

But since there are no further restrictions besides the regex definition on which timezones/offsets are available to my knowledge we likely won't have any specific checks against that.</p>",
