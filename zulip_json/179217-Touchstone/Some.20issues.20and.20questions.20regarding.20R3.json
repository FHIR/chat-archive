Regarding the latest release, there are some questions/issues I would like to address;                                                                                         <br>\n          - When we exclude unsupported features from Conformance dashboard; _include and chained parameter tests of Provider Directories is <br>\n      disabled even though our Capability Statement has ’searchInclude’ fields for each resource. What should we add to our Capability Statement <br>\n      to enable _include and chained parameter tests?<br>\n           - At _include parameter tests of Provider Directories, there is a statement that says “Bundle.total should be greater than 1” which means <br>\n       included resources should be count for the Bundle.total but the spec states Bundle.total is only affected by matched resources <br>\n       (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#count\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#count\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#count</a>).<br>\n           - Even though our Capability Statement does not support “patch” interaction, patch tests seem to be supported in Conformance Dashboard.<br>\n           - Basic Xml update tests of Location, Claim and ClaimResponse sends resources with decimals that have trailing zeros at its fraction part but <br>\n       our server clears those trailing zeros and therefore the tests are marked as fail (For example, when Location resource with longitude <br>\n       42.256500 has sent to our server our response would be Location resource with longitude 42.2565). Shouldn’t be a giving a warning message <br>\n       better than failing the tests?</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191370\">@Richard Ettema</span>  Thank you for your immediate interest on issues. We are very fond of your work and support to the community. I’ve just finished executing the tests that are published for FHIR 3.0.1. There are some issues I would like to address;<br>\n                  -  _include parameter tests now have a statement that checks “Bundle.total.toInteger() &gt;= entry.size()” but I think it should be “&lt;=” since when the bundle has some included entries, the size of Bundle.entry would always be greater than Bundle.total. To examplify, when the bundle has 1 matched and 1 included resources, the size of Bundle.entry is 2 but the Bundle.total value should be 1.<br>\n                 -  Touchstone still does not capture our server's _include and _revInclude support. As I realized, some public servers like HAPI adds _include and _revInclude parameters to search parameter list of each resource (i.e. CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.searchParam) to state that the server supports these parameters for the particular resource, and right now Touchstone checks this field as well. However, I understand from the specification that if searchInclude and searchRevInclude fields are defined for a particular resource, _include and _revInclude parameters are supported for that resource. See (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.searchInclude\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.searchInclude\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.searchInclude</a> and also <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.searchRevInclude\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.searchRevInclude\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.searchRevInclude</a>): \"If this list is empty, the server does not support includes.\" and \"reverse includes for the latter). We use these fields as defined and used in the full capability statement of FHIR; you can check via <a href=\"http://app.srdc.com.tr/fhir/stu3/metadata\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://app.srdc.com.tr/fhir/stu3/metadata\">http://app.srdc.com.tr/fhir/stu3/metadata</a>. So, what I would like to ask is; should we explicitly add _include, _revInclude to the list of search parameters for each resource, i.e. within rest.resource.searchParam, which are in fact not search parameters but search result parameters? What do you think?</p>",

If those search result parameters are to be declared in searchParam list, then it probably makes sense to declare \"_include\" and \"_revinclude\" as well in searchParam list for consistency.</p>",
