Nothing in the spec requires this, and it would be reasonable to allow for a 200 result with an appropriate failure message in the Parameters result as long as <code>result=false</code><br>\n2. A 5xx should, in general, never be an acceptable response since it indicates an internal error of the system, rather than a problem with the request itself.</p>",
