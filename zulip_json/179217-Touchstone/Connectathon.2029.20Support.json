I've just run them through Terminz and all passed. The new Terminology Services Management Group has re-kindled interest in expanding this test suite and it would be great to schedule an hour with you at the Connectathon next week and/or if you could attend the Office Hours Session that I'm running in the TS Track (timing will be on Whova). <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"340004\">@Davera Gabriel</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191405\">@Rob Hausam</span>  are the Track Leads.</p>",
