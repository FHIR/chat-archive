I'm failing some touchstone tests and I think the tests are in error.<br>\nSpecifically, this is for the CARIN-4-BlueButton tests, but the problem might be broader than that.<br>\nThe tests are looking at our CapabilityStatement and making sure that the profiles from the IG are listed under the supportProfiles element.<br>\nFor example:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>The expression &quot;CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.where(type = &#39;Coverage&#39;).select(profile|supportedProfile) contains &#39;http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/StructureDefinition/C4BB-Coverage&#39;&quot; evaluated to false in response.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I checked our CapabilityStatement and we <em>are</em> advertising our support of these profiles, its just that we include the version in ours.
