Is there anything we can do to help translate the script from one data format to another?  We're finishing up the conformance tests for Practitioner, Organization, Location, and Endpoint; but are pretty much exclusively JSON.  We don't mind supporting XML; but for us, since we use a JSON data store, we need to get everything set up with JSON before support XML.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/EljKdBVafNAod5yaT--6dErw/Screen-Shot-2017-03-30-at-3.52.03-PM.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2017-03-30-at-3.52.03-PM.png\">Screen-Shot-2017-03-30-at-3.52.03-PM.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/EljKdBVafNAod5yaT--6dErw/Screen-Shot-2017-03-30-at-3.52.03-PM.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2017-03-30-at-3.52.03-PM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/EljKdBVafNAod5yaT--6dErw/Screen-Shot-2017-03-30-at-3.52.03-PM.png\"></a></div>",
