We do not typically build conformance suites for snapshot releases of FHIR.  Is there a specific test result you'd like to be able to publish?  With some additional context around why you are inquiring about test suite plans for FHIR 4.3.0 we can provide additional support.  <br>\nThanks,<br>\nWendy</p>",

One of my goals for this connectathon was to kick the tires on my 4.3.0 implementation (to validate our implementation and also the spec--hopefully finding any spec issues <em>before</em> it gets published).  I'm able to target our impl with the 4-0-1 test suite and will probably start that soon, but not sure if it will complain or not (e.g. my CapabilityStatement won't be valid per the 4.0.1 spec)</p>",
