(I made these up on the spot, just checking whether it's desirable at all). Or have a separate <code>enrollmentStatus</code> or similar?<br>\n- <code>site</code>, maybe add a <code>primarySite</code>; or make <code>site</code> a backbone element with a reference and allowing to specify a site as the primary site?<br>\n- extending this thought to investigators: since there usually is one site PI, maybe this could really be a backbone element <code>ResearchStudySite</code> that has a PI and can be marked primary?<br>\n- something that will more and more become important are the <code>publications</code> coming from a study. Is the intention that that would go into <code>relatedArtifacts</code>?<br>\n- same would apply to <code>documents</code> that relate to the trial (like IRB approval, FDA approval, ...); <code>relatedArtifacts</code>?<br>\n- lastly, <code>acronym</code>; many of the larger trials have an acronym; make this a property, or a standard extension?</p>",

You're likely right however that it's not supported by 80% of the systems.<br>\nAlso, studies often have a <strong>short title</strong> (needs to be specified in Swiss IRB submissions for example); people are using this inconsistently as far as I can tell. <a href=\"http://CT.gov\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://CT.gov\">CT.gov</a> has a <strong>brief title</strong> and an <strong>official title</strong> field, with trials usually specifying a shorter title in the _brief_ field, so not simply the acronym.
