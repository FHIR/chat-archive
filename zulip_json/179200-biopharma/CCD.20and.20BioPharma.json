        "content": "<p>So, I know this is somewhat beyond the pale but we're building a set of 'mappings' from concepts in Healthcare to corresponding data elements in the clinical research domain.  For our purposes, as much as we'd like to jump across to FHIR wholesale, we're probably going to need to stick around the CCD for a while.  That said, in many cases the work we do with CCD XPath can be transferred pretty easily to FHIR Resource/Attribute.  So, to enable that we are still doing the mapping.  If people are interested in taking part in that (or even a primer as to why it's necessary at this time) ping me.  My more immediate need is finding a vendor or similar who can provide a guide on different implementations of the CCD - we need to be able to state assumptions when we deliver these rules/mappings and unfortunately have no visibility.  Let me know</p>",

The consultants are very busy,  but a good way to work with them would be to participate in the CCDA Implementathon being held Jan 12-13 right before the connectathon in San Antonio.  <a href=\"http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=2b25415351d5c5f116ed63d05&amp;id=c6c3945c89&amp;e=984c3efc76\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=2b25415351d5c5f116ed63d05&amp;id=c6c3945c89&amp;e=984c3efc76\">http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=2b25415351d5c5f116ed63d05&amp;id=c6c3945c89&amp;e=984c3efc76</a> </p>",
