I appreciate there may be some overlap with existing projects/initiatives within the FHIR community, however we want to work together so we are open to anyone who wishes to participate.  There are two scheduled F2F (one in Washington, DC and another in London, UK).  We have been promised at least one representative from the FDA.  If you are interested in this, please ping me.</p>",
