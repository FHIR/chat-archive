With SDC, we could call up a form within an EHR to capture data that could be sent to a research system.  With the variability of clinical trials, that's rather more of a stretch right now (though may be great for some cases later and eventually a better approach).  Instead, I was suggesting a simple query of the EHR to look up available data and then pulling that into the EDC research system, which would manage the study database and deal with all of the other data that's not coming from the EHR.  This would be a much simpler implementation that would fit well with current pharma processes.   But it hinges on being able to lookup a patient record by clinical study ID and clinical subject identifier.</p>",

You could have a service that was exposed by the EHR or had access to the EHR's data that could populate the form for you.  (Or you could query the data from the EHR and then populate the form locally.)  That said, access to data that doesn't need to go through CRFs at all would be even more powerful, so I'm certainly open to that approach.</p>",

If we take the RPE example, a provider shares details about Processes (Studies in our realm) and activities (Encounters/Visits/Procedures), so the research system could be capable of serving up a study resource for the purposes of registration.  The study resource should be meaningful and useful on the healthcare side, so surely there should be a study resource that can be suitably dereferenced for the purposes of cross referencing (for example, defining the study resource and using references to <a href=\"http://ct.gov\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ct.gov\">ct.gov</a> or who to allow cross-referencing).  Granted, this is a ways away from MVP, but I think it's worth discussing.  There are, obviously, two facets - one around the process and another around the resources.</p>",
