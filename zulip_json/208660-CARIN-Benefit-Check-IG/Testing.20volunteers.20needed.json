Since many of them are connected to a health plan, we are waiting until they get their FHIR infrastructures set-up to be compliant with the CMS rule before we can begin testing. We expect that to happen for most of the big PBMs in Q1 of next year. If you or others are interested in being a client or server to test this IG, please email me and we'll get you on our list. We anticipate having virtual connectathons about every other month in 2021 either via HL7 or CARIN so it should provide ample opportunity for folks to get involved.</p>",
