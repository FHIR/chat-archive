I don't know) and thrust me into a spotlight not of my own design. So there's an interesting connection between that anniversary (which I'll be blogging) and this news. </p>\n<p>A pervasive theme is the issue of \"fitness for purpose.\" It's the IT professionalism fail that led some to think billing data was a valid proxy for clinical reality. The other was my hospital's absurd decision to declare victory when they had never tested the Google interface on real customer data. Then people were stunned when a patient with no health IT training (just a random day-job data jockey) discovered the emperor's new clothes were a fiction. </p>\n<p>If I recall correctly (and contemporaries like <br>\n@keith boone may correct me) the whole problem back then was that there WERE no use cases - just \"Send them the data,\" which they did, and since no acceptance criteria were defined, the resulting load of crap that arrived could not be found wanting- except by common sense. </p>\n<p>Like, no, I did NOT have metastases to the spine, nor non-rheumatoid tricuspid valve disease, etc etc. </p>\n<p>Hm, this belongs in a wholly different thread.
