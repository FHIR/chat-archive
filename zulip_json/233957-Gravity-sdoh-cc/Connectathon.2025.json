I would love to chat further with you about this, as I believe we can service your needs with functionality we have created for our SDOH Questionnaire use-case. </p>\n<p>Please feel free to respond here, reach out in this Zulip chat private messages, or send us an email to get discussing.<br>\nTagging our FHIR wizard <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192609\">@Mark Scrimshire</span> to loop him in as well. </p>\n<p>Michael Cox<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:michael.cox@onyxhealth.io\">michael.cox@onyxhealth.io</a><br>\n443-763-6400</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://onyxhealth.io/\">https://onyxhealth.io/</a></p>",
