Just a couple questions regarding our meetings and how we will collaborate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I understand there is a common introductory call for all Connectathon members at 4PM today - do we have an additional separate Gravity Track call to introduce ourselves as well?  </li>\n<li>Will there be a separate meeting dial-in/link to connect to our track's meetings? We do have access to the overall connectathon link, but we are assuming for the Gravity track there will be separate dial-in information. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks so much, we look forward to hearing back about this and meeting everyone! </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Michael Cox, NewWave Telecom &amp; Technologies</li>\n</ul>",
