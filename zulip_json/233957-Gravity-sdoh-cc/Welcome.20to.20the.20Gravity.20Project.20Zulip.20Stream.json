        "content": "<p>Hello all, cross posting this from the OMOP+ FHIR stream. I help organize the OHDSI Health Equity workgroup and participate in the OHDSI Vocabulary workgroup. For our next health equity workgroup meeting (Tuesday, November 2nd at 2PM Eastern), we plan to discuss terminologies and mappings for patient-level social determinants of health, risk factors, and needs, and other domains useful for health equity research. Y'all are further along than us in this space. I'm interested in seeing how the OMOP+FHIR collaboration could enhance both of our efforts. Is there anyone here that would be able to participate in this meeting? Possibly giving a 5-7 minute overview of the work and terminologies?</p>",
