We are playing the PM/EHR role with our custom Azure FHIR Server solution. I understand you have a screening app available to integrate with REST endpoints hosting FHIR resources. Can we get together and configure your app with our secure server? I would LOVE to see our data rendered on your awesome form application, I had not seen one like yours before! Only the \"LForms\" format, so that is super exciting!</p>",

I think the easiest thing to do, is I'm going to edit our source code and add a 'Fetch' button to the footer on the main Gravity page, that will simply call the Questionnaire and Task endpoints to populate Symptomatic.  I've got it all set up and ready to go; so will take me an hour to implement and debug, and then an hour to deploy.  Consider me working on it!</p>",
