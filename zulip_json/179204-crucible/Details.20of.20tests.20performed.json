It's DSTU2 at present, and I've run crucible against it and got some useful results. How can I get a bit more detail about the specifics of the failed tests so I can reproduce them for troubleshooting? The description of the test in the web ui is ok, but doesn't really give me enough detail to reproduce the issues.. are the test definitions available in Github or somewhere else so I can dig into them in more detail?</p>",
