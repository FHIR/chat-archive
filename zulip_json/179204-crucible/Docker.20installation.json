Is it currently supported?<br>\nI was confused since it threw a lot of errors while building i.e. <code>docker-compose build</code>.<br>\nThere were errors (or warnings maybe) about node 8, bower and many others...<br>\nFrom the last output I assumed that it should be able to run, so tried <code>docker-compose up</code>.<br>\nWhile mongo container seemed to be up, the web and tasks failed with following <code>standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused \"no such file or directory\"</code>.<br>\nAny pointers would be helpful<br>\nThanks</p>",
