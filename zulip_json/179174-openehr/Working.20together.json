That's a false dichotomy, but one openEHR pushes as much as FHIR does. (\"it's just how it works in our community - clinical models get done by MDs, RNs and so on. IT people only get involved at the template level\"). Clinicians can be implementers too. We focus on implementers for 2 rasons:<br>\n- they are held to acheive actual outcomes (the journey is not the outcome. We all have too many people who think otherwise around us)<br>\n- implementers understand the constraints on their actions due to past decisions, practical obligations etc</p>\n<p>too many models I've seen, a bunch of clinicians sit down ad brainstorm about what 'should' happen without considering *why it doesn't already happen* - often there's good reasons. That's why Ian's note about the involvement of Informaticians from the beginning of the process is critical - and rarely reflected in openEHR pronouncements on the subject.</p>\n<p>There's certainly things that we have in FHIR because of this. No rational clinical model would say 'let's do it this way', but the fact is, already everybody does it that way, and we could only change that by ignoring legacy data. in regard to the 'implementer focus' we could achieve most of it by focusing on legacy data.  I've participated in archetype design, but it's usually just me saying 'hang on, there's a reason why we do it this way' - but there's other informaticians who do that - *if the focus is interoperability* (it isn't always). But focusing on legacy data alone  wouldn't deal with the first part, the practical part.

Blood pressure is probably a good starting point.  The openEHR model contains 10 main elements (systolic, diastolic, mean, exertion, body position, etc.)  Implementers (in most environments, not necessarily all) would indicate that having 10 data elements in the UI to capture blood pressure is unreasonable.  Certainly most of those notions would be relegated into the \"extension\" or \"optional\" space when profiling.  It's not that they're never relevant, it's that within the scope of most practice, that information is either not relevant or implicit.  Implementers will add considerations around screen real estate, data entry time, navigability, support of legacy information, consistency with other similar data (allowing re-use of user interface components), ability to search/sort/filter, etc.  All of which is vital to having data actually captured and displayed in real systems.</p>",

The BP (or any) archetype includes _possible_ data points / groups. The elements are nearly all optional. The choice of what actual elements are needed in some particular circumstance, form, communication etc, is defined in an openEHR template, which includes as few or many of the elements as it wants from one or more archetypes, and sets them optional, mandatory as needed. It 'removes' the others by constraining 'occurrences' to {0}. <br>\nSo the archetypes are a _library_ of data points/groups/value sets _independent_ of use context.

There is no way that any implementation is going to have all of the blood pressure archetype data ppoint is the Ui or even the allowable end-use dataset  (your profiles/our templates). The point of the maximal dataset is just to allow the development of a rich, shared understanding of the varied requirements around a given topic, particularly where the intent is to support native system information models. It is an aspiration not a strict requirement, and it is certainly not reflected in actual system use. In fact, I think if you look at the  key FHIR resources and equivalent archetypes meds, allergies, conditions etc, the difference in 'maximality' is not that evident. There will be differences in observations as we are trying to capture knowledge about each archetype needed for in-system use, not just that subset likely to be of interest for data exchange, but I suspect that over time, the exchange requirement will start to meet the in-system requirement e.g. a specialist departmental module interacting with a 3rd-party app and needing fairly granular, specialist aspects of the model not required for generci exchange.</p>",

In FHIR's case, we try hard to never design at that level.  Our focus is on the data that we know is going to be used.  We may define some of the other bits as extensions too - for those who need them, but it means that an implementer can look at our spec and know roughly what's expected vs. edge case in most environments without having to do any site specific profiling (though profiling is still needed to get to really tight requirements).  The essential difference is that openEHR's initial designs are focused on \"completeness\", potentially independent of implementation practice.  FHIR's designs are focused on implementation practice, potentially independent of \"completeness\".  In openEHR, the implementation practice comes from later constraint.  In FHIR, completeness comes from later extension.  In the end, we can both express the same things, but we come at it from different directions.</p>",

We certainly make an effort to understand a broad sense of clinical requirements and good practice, and are comfortable to allow concepts and variance that are expressed by our reviewers (though that is not absolute either), but completeness is not achievable either in fact or in any sensible timescale. Most of the difficult and time-consuming issues that we have to wrangle with are mostly presented to us by our vendors/implementers, since these represent the challenges faced by them as in-system requirements.  This is, of course, at-odds with the FHIR philosophy /requirement, which is limited for now to  limited interfacing between systems, but as the scope and depth of that interfacing grows (or indeed attempts to use in-system), I believe FHIR will face the same issues, forcing more and more competing extensions to be created. If nothing else, the openEHR maximal dataset approach tries to reduce the number of competing secondary artefacts by making the primary artefact better fit-for-purpose for a wider group of consumers. So we hope to reduce the number of extensions, whilst recognising (as per FHIR) that further profiling will be required to turn these primary artefacts into locally useable profiled/templated models. </p>\n<p>Interesting discussion.     </p>",

We just do it differently.<br>\nThe openEHR approach is to create a library of data points / data groups that are independent of particular use - these are the archetypes. This is the only rational thing to do: there is no point modelling all the blood pressure data points, or any of the other 10,000 data points any more than once. Without a library approach, any effort is doomed to repeating definitions of what should be re-usable clinical entities.

Implementation type people may also contribute, but it's not on the basis of a particular system (unless the archetypes being developed are specifically for that solution); it's more to provide input on 'what current systems do'.<br>\nThe next thing that is needed in any modelling ecosystem is a way of assembling domain data-points and data-groups into context-specific data sets - it could be the data for a form, a particular message, a document etc. In openEHR, this is called a Template, and this is what is deployed - all openEHR systems are built with templates, which in turn contain the relevant bits of various archetypes. Templates have an important properly - they preserve the paths of archetypes elements they use. The people who build these templates tend to be more implementation oriented, and also local to the solution being built (but you can still build a standard template for a country, e.g. a discharge summary).<br>\nThe next step is to create and persist data. Data in openEHR correspond to the templates, which means that they actually all correspond to the archetype structures, including the archetype paths. Doing this practically is where template-generated downstream artefacts come into play - we generate all kinds of things from the templates - XSDs, facades, REST URIs and so on. These are what get used by application developers.<br>\nNow we get to querying: here we use a simple language (AQL) based on archetype paths within a SQL-like statement structure, also the '//' XML operator, and this is all that is needed to enable queries written straight from archetypes to work over all that templated data. AQL querying is the backbone of operational openEHR systems - it sits behind most forms. The queries are all reusable, due to only being dependent on the archetypes.<br>\nWhat's really happening in the above is that there are different points in the development of any given clinical model content at which different types of professional become involved, where it makes sense. <br>\nI hope this clarifies.</p>",

        "content": "<p>One p.s.: all of this, and any other standards-like effort (FHIR included) is of course wrapped up in the sociological and political realities both internal to SDOs/SROs and in the wider world. These other actors may try to impose their own 'top-down' visions or other ways of working which might not always fit nicely with the vision of the standards developers. Result: developing real practical social networks that do have the desired outcomes can be a real challenge. As Ian always says, nearly all the real 'problems' are people-related, not technological. Nevertheless key aspects of HL7's and openEHR's (and all other ecosystems) internal vision does involve social aspects like crowd-sourced modelling and agile implementation, and these are quite tricky to get right.<br>\nIn the end I would make a plea for all major ecosystem/SDO/SRO groups to at least try to understand clearly what the intentional basis of the other ecosystems is, and distinguish that from unintended consequences due to sometimes inappropriate or misguided uses in the real world. When we do that, we can have better conversations both on the technical level and on how to better take account of sociological challenges.</p>",

If we discover that some openEHR data type can't be converted we would raise an issue in the normal way and in some cases the FHIR infrastructure might need some adjustment. <br>\nI would not expect much of that, since Grahame took the trouble to look at the openEHR data types during early FHIR development. The area I think that will be 'interesting' will be as usual, representation of coded terms and value sets. Generally openEHR just tries to follow mainstream good practice here.<br>\nFor reference: a partially completed FHIR/openEHR datatypes analysis: <a href=\"https://openehr.atlassian.net/wiki/display/stds/FHIR+-+openEHR+Data+Types+cross-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://openehr.atlassian.net/wiki/display/stds/FHIR+-+openEHR+Data+Types+cross-analysis\">https://openehr.atlassian.net/wiki/display/stds/FHIR+-+openEHR+Data+Types+cross-analysis</a></p>",

Something like open access to to the internal datastructure and content of the publication? That would require the authors to be a bit altruistic (or rather their financing sources to demand an open approach) and invest a bit in openness up front instead of trusting the publishing house to do things for them (making somebody else pay). An open knowledge sharing would force the publisher to change their business model, and that would only happen if the authors or a big enough part of their support system demand such a change. :-) </p>",

The point is that a change toward openness and a willingnes to pay for openness up front has been going on for  long time in scientific publication.

But most likely it will be like in scientific publication and not change much before the people financing/buying the systems understand the benefits of openness. (Some regions/segments/customers will go the open way earlier than others.) Until then it is great to also have some standardized simple way to access \"abstracs\" and other bits and pieces of EHR content, so there is room for borh openEHR and the current FHIR approach.
