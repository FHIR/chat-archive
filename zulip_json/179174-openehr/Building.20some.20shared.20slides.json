See attached presentation. I reduced text-density on first slide(s) and followed René's idea to add one slide discussing when to use what. I also  split the slide set into two parts...<br>\nFirst part: for buzzword-level \"lay audience\" (useful e.g. for Vitalis morning intro)<br>\nSecond part: for people familiar with interoperability issues (useful e.g. for Vitalis afternoon workshop)<br>\nIt would be wonderful if at least the core FHIR team (and other interested) could review this slide set (it's only 5 \"real\" slides). I'll then ask the rest of the openEHR specification editorial comittee to review it too.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/2u4cFiBQD5lng4UBF7wiMeN0/fhir-openehr-v03.pptx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"fhir-openehr-v03.pptx\">fhir-openehr-v03.pptx</a> </p>",

And I want to mention again, that interoperability vs intraoperability is not a bianry disjunction -it's a continuum, and as pointed out elsewhere<br>\n, both FHIR and openEHR are variable in this regard</p>",

(as usual, not the ones who benefit)\"  And this is an important part: depending on how important intraoperability is for a given usecase or community, more or less money will be put into intraoperability. And this mostly means government-led projects will focus on intraoperability (and receive pushback from vendors), while most decentralized - smaller community projects will \"just do what works for them\".  As a result, any succesful standard - used across this whole spectrum - will cause heaps of isolated, non-interoperable islands of data. </p>",

One extreme on a possible scale is to let that legacy force - be your main guiding light. There are several problems associated with this extreme (including  slowing down clinical agility/progress). Thankfully FHIR is not at the 100% legacy extreme end of the scale, the systems with slowest change won’t dictate the speed of FHIR content change. The 80%/20%-FHIR-inclusion window (plus some filtering of which systems are considered worth looking at) likely speeds up change.</p>\n<p>Another extreme on the scale is to let the ever changing clinical needs (and the process you have for capturing them) be the thing “forcing your hand”. That kind of force would be very demanding for system providers if done in a, for them, uncontrolled way. Thankfully openEHR considers both kinds of forces and has many mechanisms for making life (maintenance etc) easier for system providers when facing constant change.</p>",

Non-breaking changes can be handled reasonably fast by most system implementations, but the breaking ones forcing changes deep down in semantics or database schemas etc are usually a pain (and something that at least take some of our “classical” system providers long time to do).<br>\nWhat I find very interesting with openEHR is that it provides many mechanisms for making both non-breaking and breaking changes easier to handle for system providers (and for the customers, the healthcare providers). There are also mechanisms for handling legacy data import, storage (and human readability). Do you want some examples or are you all familiar with those mechanisms?</p>",
