See above link for examples. Being always compliant with a underlying Reference Model is what eases systems evolution. Data compliant with archetype A can coexist with data compliant with archetype A' (or B) without having to change anything about persistence. Templates for local (with further constraint use) are compliant with parent archetypes, so querying/validation can be safely done over the parent archetype. Technically templates are just specialized archetypes.

I'm pretty sure main issue with profiling is to want the definition \"format\" itself be a (flat) Resource, which is a cool geeky thing to do but makes simple constraints to become too verbose.<br>\nBTW,  I've generated archetypes based on FHIR RM.

If you don't believe this, just consider a very basic concrete fact: with each HL7 standard, from HL7v2, CDA, HL7v3 and FHIR, the models of clinical entities are rebuilt from scratch each time, directly in the formalism of the messages. There's no longitudinal re-use of blood pressure, microbiology result, or any of the O(10,000) other clinical models.
