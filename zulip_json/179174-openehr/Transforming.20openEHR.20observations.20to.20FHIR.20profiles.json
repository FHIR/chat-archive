The body weight example is pretty good as it is a sort of minimal example of the archetyping approach vs. profiling.

With observation archetypes (and maybe Compositions), it seems to me that the idea is more useful as there are quite a few observations already defined as openEHR archetypes that can be turned into profiles if you know where to put things.<br>\nThe process I've defined doesn't require itself  that the source archetype class is an Observation (you can take CLUSTER archetypes or even full OPT profiles).<br>\nThe idea is to choose the data points from the archetype that would end in the profile. You can choose to leave data points out, or decide that something is the main value or the observation, one of the components, or even an extension to that profile.<br>\nData types transformation part could potentially be reused in other archetypes-&gt; resource transformations, but should be done carefully as not all data types are allowed as value[x] (or whatever[x]) in different profiles (this is one of the main reasons I decided to support the automatic generation of extensions in the first place...)</p>",
