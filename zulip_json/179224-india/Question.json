Anyway you will have to comply with FHIR spec / profiles, so your clients can integrate with you easily. It is not a question of acquiring the certification, most importantly the interoperability is what that matters. if you are going to implement the solution complying with FHIR standards, then the integration will be smooth for your clients. That's what is improving interoperability in healthcare. hope it makes sense. Thanks</p>",
