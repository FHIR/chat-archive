I attended Redmond DevDays in 2019 and one session I liked as a last-minute change with a gentleman from Microsoft discussing Bias in Training Data for machine learning. I can't find the session info in the agenda or recordings because it was a last minute change. I'm trying to find the speaker's info to connect on a AI Ethics work project. Does anyone have his contact info? TIA</p>",

I did look at that Agenda PDF handout as well as all the recorded session videos and documents/decks uploaded. I want to say that it was in the Sonora (or maybe Lassen) room. It was a smaller session and the topic changed at the last minute when the original/scheduled presenter couldn't make it to DevDays.</p>",
