Am i correct in this? What is the best practice here, assume the receiving system will accept nulls in attributes or postprocess the grapql response to take out the attributes with nulls completely?</p>\n<p>I am leaning towards the latter (remove null attributes from the json) because the json will not validate as fhir otherwise, and this simplifies passing on the messages to other systems, but this seems an unforunate extra step.</p>",
