Unfortunately, these documents contain some errors which renders them invalid. I have opened a Pull Request fixing these errors several weeks ago (<a href=\"https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/pull/615\">https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/pull/615</a>). I have not received any feedback, yet. What is the process of moving this forward? Can anyone of the core contributors have a look?</p>\n<p>As far as I understand, the GraphQL generation code I touched is only used for generating the aforementioned R5 schema definitions? So my changes should not break any HAPI GraphQL functionality?</p>\n<p>Some feedback would be greatly aprecciated!</p>",
