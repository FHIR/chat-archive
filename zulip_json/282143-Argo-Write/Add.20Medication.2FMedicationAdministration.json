Not sure if it still current, but I'd have a comment.</p>\n<p>In my use case, remote monitoring of type 1 diabetes, most data is represented as Observations, but at least we (Sensotrend) are using MedicationAdministration for insulin doses from insulin pumps and \"smart\" insulin pens that track doses automatically. Very much patient generated data, and a very common use case.</p>\n<p>I'd think the same is true for smart inhalers, for instance.</p>\n<p>So I propose to add Medication/MedicationAdministration on the Medications row. Or at least consider this detail for the resulting IG.</p>",
