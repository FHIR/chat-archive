The natural semantics for ValueSet exclude is subtract, but it doesn't operate at on ValueSets; one needs 'subtract' to match with 'import', but then we need to decide on the order of operation; would 'subtract' happen after all the imports, but before all the includes/excludes, or at the end, with the excludes.</p>\n<p>My natural inclination here would be to re-work import more extensively to allow for general nesting of 'union', 'intersect', and 'subtract' with other ValueSets</p>",
