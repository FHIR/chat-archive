Question:  Do I need to be able to understand all of the codings in a CodedConcept element in order to understand its intent?  Will any one of them do?     There are examples that appear to work both ways -- some which show a local coding system and what is assumed to be its equivalent in a standardized system. ( <a href=\"http://hl7-fhir.github.io/diagnosticreport-example-f202-bloodculture.json.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7-fhir.github.io/diagnosticreport-example-f202-bloodculture.json.html\">http://hl7-fhir.github.io/diagnosticreport-example-f202-bloodculture.json.html</a>) In this case, I would think that the fact that I understand the SNOMED code for Laboratory Test would be sufficient.   Yet there are other examples where multiple codes (sometimes from different coding systems) appear to be used as a poor man's compositional grammar.  In this case, if I only recognize the codes from one coding system, my interpretation would either be too broad (fracture of the arm) or nonsensical (laterality left).  </p>",

The sequencing rule is the same as the etiology/manifestation pair, “use additional code” indicates that a secondary code should be added.</p>\n<p>For example, for bacterial infections that are not included in chapter 1, a secondary code from category B95, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus, as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere, or B96, Other bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere, may be required to identify the bacterial organism causing the infection. A “use additional code” note will normally be found at the infectious disease code, indicating a need for the organism code to be added as a secondary code.</p>\n<p>“Code first” notes are also under certain codes that are not specifically manifestation codes but may be due to an underlying cause. When there is a “code first” note and an underlying condition is present, the underlying condition should be sequenced first.</p>\n<p>“Code, if applicable, any causal condition first”, notes indicate that this code may be assigned as a principal diagnosis when the causal condition is unknown or not applicable. If a causal condition is known, then the code for that condition should be sequenced as the principal or first-listed diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Multiple codes may be needed for sequela, complication codes and obstetric codes to more fully describe a condition.
