I have written to Peter.  It is unclear how much he could have benefited from FHIR RDF.  I think it would have simplified translation to the analysis model that he used, which was Entities and Roles Participating in Acts, but I have no data to prove that.  I asked if the RIM mapping available in FHIR would have helped, and he didn't think so, because he only used a simple E-R-P-A model, not the full detail of RIM.</p>",
