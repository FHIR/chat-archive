        "content": "<p>On today's FHIR RDF call, we discussed the possibility of renaming this page: <a href=\"https://hl7-fhir.github.io/ontology-module.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hl7-fhir.github.io/ontology-module.html\">https://hl7-fhir.github.io/ontology-module.html</a> .  At the moment it is (misleadingly) titled \"FHIR Ontology Module\", and I received a couple of comments already, saying that title is misleading.  The page is really an umbrella page for all of the RDF-related material -- not only the ontology.   We discussed alternate names, and the one that seemed best to those of us on the call was \"FHIR Linked Data Module\", because in the semantic web space, \"Linked Data\" seems to be the term that has most won.  It would also involve changing the page URL to linked-data-module.html , so it might necessary to set up a redirect from the previous URL.  Also, to make the words \"RDF\" and \"Ontology\" more visible on the FHIR home page <a href=\"https://hl7-fhir.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hl7-fhir.github.io/\">https://hl7-fhir.github.io/</a> we would put those words in the little module box on the home page, linking them specifically to the RDF and Ontology pages (which are also linked from the module page).  Any objection to making these naming changes?  </p>",
