I don't immediately see how it would improve the RDF semantics directly, but I think it would benefit the RDF indirectly by enabling systems to include or exclude that branch of data based on the type of modifier and the purpose at hand.  I think I would have to see a strawman proposal, with specific modifier types, to analyze the idea further.  It looks like a worthy goal though.</p>",
