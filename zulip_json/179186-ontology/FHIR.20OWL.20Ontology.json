I would like to use it as a unifying ontology in order to map different data sources to it. I found this one while I used Google: <a href=\"http://w3c.github.io/hcls-fhir-rdf/spec/ontology.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://w3c.github.io/hcls-fhir-rdf/spec/ontology.html\">http://w3c.github.io/hcls-fhir-rdf/spec/ontology.html</a>. But unfortunately I don't quite understand the structure of the project and the \"outcome\". Maybe someone here has a little hint wheater such an ontology exists.</p>",
