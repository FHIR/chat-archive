I'm just trying to digest \"HL7 Standard: Clinical Quality Language Release 1\" (from May 2015) - very curiously  they completely ducked subsumption: on page 61 it says \"The reason for this omission is that subsumption is<br>\ngenerally a very complex operation, with different terminology systems providing different<br>\nmechanisms for defining and interpreting such relationships. As a result, specifying how that<br>\noccurs is beyond the scope of CQL at this time. This is not to say that a specific library of<br>\nsubsumption operators could not be provided and broadly adopted and used, only that the CQL<br>\nspecification does not attempt to dictate the semantics of that operation.\"</p>",
