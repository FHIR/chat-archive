At the virtual HL7 WGM September 2020 a meeting was held to plan how the issue would be addressed. The detailed action items from that meeting can be found on confluence at <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/SD/CDA+R2+Stylesheet\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/SD/CDA+R2+Stylesheet</a><br>\nThe stylesheet vulnerability was addressed and release 4.0.2-beta8 – 2020-09-21 contained the fix. All published CDA implementation guide packages were reviewed to determine if the vulnerable stylesheet had been included in the download package.<br>\nErrata releases have been published to remove the vulnerable stylesheet and reference the new GitHub repository where the corrected stylesheet is now managed.  This change impacted seven CDA R2.0 implementation guides. Implementers are encouraged to update their download package for these Implementation Guides and discontinue use of stylesheets versions prior to 4.0.2-beta8 - 2020-09-21.</p>\n<p>CDAR2_IG_CCDA_CLINNOTES_R1_DSTU2.1_2015AUG (Errata #6: 2020OCT)<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=492\">http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=492</a></p>\n<p>HL7 CDA® R2 IG: C-CDA Templates for Clinical Notes R2.1 Companion Guide, Release 2 - US Realm   <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=447\">http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=447</a></p>\n<p>HL7 CDA® R2 Implementation Guide: Personal Advance Care Plan Document, Release 1 - US Realm     <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=434\">http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=434</a></p>\n<p>HL7 CDA® R2 Implementation Guide: Personal Advance Care Plan Document, Release 2 - US Realm <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=434\">http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=434</a></p>\n<p>HL7 Standard for CDA® Release 2: Imaging Integration; Basic Imaging Reports in CDA and DICOM, Release 1 <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=13\">http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=13</a></p>\n<p>HL7 CDA® R2 Implementation Guide: C-CDA R2.1; Advance Directives Templates, Release 1 - US Realm    <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=473\">http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=473</a></p>\n<p>HL7 CDA® R2 Implementation Guide: C-CDA R2.1 Supplemental Templates for Nutrition, Release 1 - US Realm <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=478\">http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=478</a></p>\n<p>HL7 Standard for CDA® Release 2: Imaging Integration; Basic Imaging Reports in CDA and DICOM, Release 1 <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=13\">http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=13</a></p>\n<p>HL7 CDA Management Group</p>",
