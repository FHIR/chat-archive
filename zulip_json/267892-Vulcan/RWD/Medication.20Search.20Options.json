However it returns everything related to the patient which can be a lot of extra data. </p>\n<p>Option 2: Patient$everything using the _type filter parameter<br>\nThis would be perfect, allows you to specify an explicit list of the Resource types you want included in the return. However this doesn't appear to be well supported - HAPI doesn't appear to support it for instance. Likely most EMRs would not either, might not even support $everything</p>\n<p>Option 3: Issue requests using the _include _revinclude search parameters<br>\n_include and _revinclude can only be specified for defined resource search parameters. <br>\nMedicationXXX.reasonReference is not a searchable attribute for any of the MedicationXX resources.</p>",
