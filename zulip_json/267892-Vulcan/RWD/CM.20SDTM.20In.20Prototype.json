There are some mappings from ICD10 to MEDDRA (as an example which you can see on bioportal).  What you would probably need to do is take the displayText for the coded value and recode that using the 'accepted' dictionary (there's still probaby going to be slots for terms LLT, PT, BODSYS in SDTM for the foreseeable).</p>",
