My understanding is that just the attribute turns STU, not the resource.  Can we clearly confirm, refute that understanding?  BTW, there were still some folks on the call who believed that in an earlier call (not OO but another one - not clear which one) it was indicated that everything in R5 would turn \"automatically\" STU, which was a clear misunderstanding, but nevertheless still present among some.</p>",
