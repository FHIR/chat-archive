Perhaps as new resources are designed and as existing resources climb up the maturity scale, we should be asking editors to bias toward allowing 0..</em> by default, unless they can robustly reject the possibility that they will ever want more than one element in a slot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How should workgroups think through options for \"fixing\" broken stuff in normative. Options include 1) adding new elements that can be used alongside the old/broken ones, 2) deprecating elements, 3) deprecating entire resources -- (1) creates some pain of information showing up in more than one place; beyond that, it's not really clear how (2) or (3) would play out in real life, and it'd be good to document how we expect dependent IGs, consumers, and producers would deal with this.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
