I'm pretty sure that's going to exceed the capacity of the community to perform meaningful review...</p>\n<p>On the IG front, this issue is likely to get worse.  In some ways we want it to get worse because we need work groups to transition from resource design to IG design as the resources solidify and go normative.  At the same time, we need to ensure that specifications are receiving meaningful review and evolving to have high quality so that the HL7 and FHIR brands continue to have value.  I think that means that we need to start introducing some criteria around what can go to ballot, how often things can go to ballot and when they can go to ballot - so that community has a hope of keeping up.</p>\n<p>I don't have any specific proposals, but I think this is a real issue we're going to need to address and so would like to put it on our list of discussion topics.</p>",
