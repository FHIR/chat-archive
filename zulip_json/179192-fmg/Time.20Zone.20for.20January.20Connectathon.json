While it seems safe to assume that we would align the time zones of the two events, we wanted to get official confirmation from FMG. If you could respond with an up or down on that, I'd appreciate it. </p>\n<p>Sandy would like to discuss timing for opening and closing sessions, but I haven't heard back from her yet on her specific question.</p>",

I was looking for it because I was making a slide with the Connectathon details for a presentation tomorrow and I used Eastern because that's what I saw (I don't recall now exactly where it was that I saw it, but I'm sure I can find it).  If it's going to be Pacific we had better decide and document that now.</p>",
