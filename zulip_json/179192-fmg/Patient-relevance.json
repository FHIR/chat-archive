Obviously a few IGs will exist that will have no patient impact.  But most should have something useful to say.  While our focus needs to be on implementer-targeted, we want to ensure that our specifications are patient-accessible.  I.e. patients who come to our community should be able to understand how the different pieces we build are relevant to them - and for some, are directly usable by them.  That will enable them to either use stuff or advocate for change if what we're producing isn't actually meeting their needs.</p>\n<p>The above are candidates for our meeting next week</p>",
