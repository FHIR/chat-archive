There are a number of benefits to using this to collect structured data. 1.) We have the track lead list gathered and can see updates easily so that as things change we don't miss people. 2.) Newcomers can see the track descriptions and high level info at a glance on the home page.  3.) Having the template render a ToC at the top of the track page makes it easier for participants to navigate the page.  I recognize that this causes a bit of pain for the track leads, but hopefully the outcomes described here will be worth it. Thanks for hanging in there with us as we try to make this better in a virtual world.</p>",
