We value your input and trust that you find the event both educational and fun!</p>\n<p>As you probably know, the event is organized into a number of tracks, and you are welcome to participate in as many tracks  as you have capacity for (though it's always best to have one as a focus). To help us with organizing the event on the day (and in particular the seating), we'd very much appreciate it if you could indicate on the spreadsheet below which tracks you will be participating in, and in which roles. It would also help if you could indicate your primary track, as we'll use that when we assign tracks to tables...</p>\n<p>If you have any questions abut a track, then it is best to contact the track co-ordinator - all the track proposals are documented here: <a href=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Category:201609_FHIR_Connectathon_Track_Proposals\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Category:201609_FHIR_Connectathon_Track_Proposals\">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Category:201609_FHIR_Connectathon_Track_Proposals</a></p>\n<p>If it's about the event in general, then I can be reached at <a href=\"mailto:david.hay25@gmail.com\" title=\"mailto:david.hay25@gmail.com\">david.hay25@gmail.com</a></p>\n<p>Spreadsheet link: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rrz8yqkG5gHhSEzUvZxP-6_CCFr_6F0FUElFRGmObyw/edit#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rrz8yqkG5gHhSEzUvZxP-6_CCFr_6F0FUElFRGmObyw/edit#gid=0\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rrz8yqkG5gHhSEzUvZxP-6_CCFr_6F0FUElFRGmObyw/edit#gid=0</a></p>\n<p>Again, thank you for coming and we look forward to meeting you on the day,</p>\n<p>cheers...</p>",
