This has many advantages in my view, and I understand by overwhelming positive feedback both openly and directly. The committee would like to be sure that they would be allowed to make this switch at this time, and not need to write a new PSS. I asserted that the PSS is about the use-case output, not the technical approach. However the committee would like to control this risk by asking FMG if it would be okay if they were to switch without writing a new PSS and thus hitting PSS deadline problems.</p>",
