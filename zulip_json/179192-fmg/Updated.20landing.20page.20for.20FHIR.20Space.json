For now, many pages still need to be reviewed and some may need to be archived, but I think the page looks a little better and easier to navigate.  Hope you do too :) <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Product+Family\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Product+Family</a> </p>\n<p>I would appreciate your review of the landing page and let me know if the pages fit better under a different section or if you have an idea for a sub-title of a given section.</p>",
