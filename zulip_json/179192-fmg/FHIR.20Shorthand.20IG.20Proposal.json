Can you please consider at your earliest opportunity the IG proposal for FSH:  <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Shorthand\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Shorthand\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Shorthand</a> . I guess the official deadline was Feb. 16, but in some sense this isn't a \"normal\" IG with clinical content and profiles, but rather, using the IG as a vehicle to deliver content to the ballot. Nonetheless, it needs some attention and perhaps the official blessing of FMG.</p>",
