That said, this is a very simple technical correction - the removal of content that is unambiguously wrong and has no substantive impact on implementers or the interpretation of the spec, so I have no problem with that occurring without a formal change request.  However, a more relevant question is what the TSC is comfortable with given that it's their call . . .</p>",
