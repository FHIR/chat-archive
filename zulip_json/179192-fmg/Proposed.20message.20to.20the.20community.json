        "content": "<p>Wanted to run this by everyone before sharing:<br>\nBased on feedback from many of the work groups at the Sept. WGM, the FMG has decided to set a firm date for the STU and Normative ballots for FHIR R5 based on the May 2022 cycle.  Final content from work groups will be due by midnight Eastern on Sunday, Mar. 13, 2022.  This will be followed by a 2-week QA period and a short period to apply QA-identified changes.  The ballot is scheduled to open on Apr. 8.  If a second normative ballot is necessary, we expect it to open in July, focused only on substantive changes to normative resources or normative scope.  The intention will be to publish late Q3, early Q4 of 2022.<br>\nWorkgroups are asked to ensure that they are applying agreed tracker items and have their tracker backlog mostly clear to be prepared to receive and act on ballot responses.  Workgroups MAY begin triaging proposals to identify those they need to defer to a future core release - recognizing that any R6 release is likely to be at least 2 years subsequent to R5 publication.  Workgroups are also asked to recognize the priority of the FHIR core work and should work with any IG projects they have to ensure that core priorities can be met.  If there is a conflict between FHIR core and 'urgent' implementation guide activity without sufficient resources to accomplish both, please reach out to the FMG early.<br>\nR4B is likely to publish in either Nov. or Dec. of 2021, dependent on remaining committee reconciliation processes.</p>",
