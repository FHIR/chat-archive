Some tracks though are bleeding into some or all of Monday, and some attendees are expecting a three-day event. This is causing confusion and disappointment.</p>",

When we went to virtual it was decided that we would do a kick off on the afternoon before because of time zone issues. Publishing the kick off for the day before then prompts some track leads to kick off the day before. If we put the start date for the day after the kick off people may be frustrated that they missed the kick off. Perhaps we can clarify on the events page that it is two days but that preparation calls happen in advance. Thoughts?</p>",
