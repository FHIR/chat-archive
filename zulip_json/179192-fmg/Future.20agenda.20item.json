I think a large part of the problem is that people have trouble differentiating changes to ANSI normative specifications vs. STUs, the latter of which comprise most of our work.  We don’t need to treat STUs as normative, though we still need to follow our processes for STUs because we’ll be audited on that by ANSI as our accreditation body.  The important thing is that we have documented, predictable, consistent processes that are reproducible for an audit.  I should think we can demonstrate that sufficiently for TSC though we may need to make some GOM updates.</p>\n<p>Wayne</p>",
