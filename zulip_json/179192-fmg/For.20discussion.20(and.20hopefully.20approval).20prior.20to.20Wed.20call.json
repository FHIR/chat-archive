For those who don't, quick summary: The HTA's policy for the issuing of URI's does not currently take into account whether a URI has already been assigned and mentioned in the FHIR specification or is otherwise in use in the FHIR community.  More importantly, they do not feel the policy <em>should</em> take this into account and that the URIs used to reference code systems should be determined solely by the preference of the terminology author and should change, as necessary, according to the desires of the terminology source.  Obviously this is contrary to our intended behavior and has serious consequences for implementers.  However, discussion with the HTA chair, including bringing in Wayne has not resulted in a change to policy.  As a result, there are HTA published URIs that diverge from this FHIR-published URIs for the same code systems and the prospect of more in the future, as well as the prospect of HTA-published URIs changing over time.</p>\n<p>I've written up a detailed letter that describes the issue, the background and the criticality of the HTA <em>not</em> issuing conflicting URIs, as well as removing those they've already posted.  The intention is to pass this to the HTA prior to their Wed. call - which happens the hour before our call.  If we can't come to agreement on that call, the follow-up plan is to escalate the issue to the TSC.</p>\n<p>Austin, Wayne and David have already had a chance to review and comment and I've made a few changes as a result.  I'd now like all of the other members of the FMG to review the document and - if you're in agreement - to endorse it.  Feedback on content also welcome.  Obviously, I'd appreciate review sooner than later so that we can get it to the HTA in time to consider prior to their Wed. call.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_QJ4tc4qufQVGsvIWruCjIMfxT87ABrHwWVWzG8AwO4/edit\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_QJ4tc4qufQVGsvIWruCjIMfxT87ABrHwWVWzG8AwO4/edit</a></p>",

Many of you have seen my anguish with IHE having good reason to change (i.e. formatCode vocabulary).<br>\nAs I read this, it seems strange to me. We have been willing to break many systems that are using happily OIDs, and have happily changed over to <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org\">terminology.hl7.org</a> root... we have broken many systems.    so this seems really conflicting to be complaining now, simply because HTA is defining a rule that does similar (lesser) breaking?</p>",

It came about after considerable discussion, including consulting with the implementer community.  It was also a coordinated change that was dependent on FHIR version - and thus something that could also be managed at a layer that involves translation.  The URI used in STU3 is one thing, the URI used in R4 is another.  Also, when we did it, we promised it would never happen again.</p>\n<p>What the HTA is saying is that, regardless of what release of FHIR you're using (and irrespective of what that release of FHIR might declare), as of a few months ago, the URI used for ATC codes is now different and using the wrong one is non-conformant.  There's no translation point there.  It's just a random breaking change done without discussing with the community or regard for implementer impact.</p>",
