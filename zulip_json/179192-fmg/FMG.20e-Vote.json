We had a PSS to vote on from PHER that we had reviewed previously but not formally voted on as some concerns were being addressed.<br>\nLloyd made a motion on the call today to approve this PSS and send it to e-vote due to lack of quorum. I believe that this notice opens a two day discussion period prior to the vote.<br>\nThanks!</p>",
