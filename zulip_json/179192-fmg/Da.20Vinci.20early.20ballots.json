One obvious issue is that management groups should presumably be asked as part of the approval process for out-of-cycle ballots.  Typically we say final freeze about 4 days before ballot open (so Oct. 21st) and initial QA deadline either 2 weeks prior (or 1 week prior with WG sign-off) which would be Oct. 7 or 14.  Substantive content deadline would be 2 weeks prior to the 7th - which would be yesterday.  Can we confirm these dates on our call Wed?</p>",
