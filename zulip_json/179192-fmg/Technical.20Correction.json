My interest in the STU3 obs-7 constraint is actually prompted by my work with Nictiz and their profiles.<br>\nThe Nictiz MedMij IG is based on FHIR STU3 3.0.1. Early on in their testing program they found that a number of their Observation profiles were running into this issue where the validation engine was incorrectly passing Observation instances due to the obs-7 constraint. In order to correct this issue I have been manually updating their Observation profile snapshots to update the obs-7 constraint with the corrected expression from FHIR R4.<br>\nI had hoped that this would be resolved in the R3 3.0.2 technical correction but it appears that my arguments have not been persuasive.<br>\nIf the obs-7 constraint is not updated, this will require that I continue to manually update the Nictiz MedMij Observation profiles so that we can continue to support them when they update their IG to R3 3.0.2.</p>",
