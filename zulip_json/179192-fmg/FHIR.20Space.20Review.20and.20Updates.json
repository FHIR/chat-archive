We will continue to update this page going forward as we complete our review and will be bringing this forward each FMG meeting to determine next steps and who on FMG will help with the content review and updates.  <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Space+Review\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Space+Review</a></p>",
