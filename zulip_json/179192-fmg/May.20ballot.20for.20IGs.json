Will gForge be available to be used, or will we be switching to JIRA?<br>\n2. How will ballot comments be reflected into gForge if the commenter didn't directly enter them there?<br>\n3. Can gForge be used for committee formal reconcilliation? Meaning will there be support to provide dispsition output reporting as needed by HL7 governance?<br>\n4. If not using gForge, will there be a way to export gForge into spreadsheet?</p>",

Ballot comments will be imported into gForge from spreadsheets if balloters don't put the comments into gForge directly.  We strongly prefer that comments be entered into Jira and the ballot spreadsheet only references the comment numbers and the votes (affirmative or negative).  Note that for a gForge item to be considered as a ballot item, it MUST be referenced by a spreadsheet submitted to the ballot desktop.<br>\n3. For FHIR, gForge <em>must</em> be used for formal reconciliation<br>\n4. There's a transform that allows extracting ballot comments and creating a reconciliation spreadsheet for posting to the ballot desktop once reconciliation is complete.</p>",
