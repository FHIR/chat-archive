If a contained resource were allowed to have a missing status, you absolutely *could not* infer that it had the same status as the containing resource.  We have two choices here - make status minOccurs = 0 or add a status of \"unknown\".  The semantics would be the same in either case, but are someone more explicit in the latter, which is why I prefer it.</p>",
