The provider who started filling out the questionnaire may have changed the prefilled data. When restarting the process of answering the questionnaire, what do we do with the changed data. Should we retain the initial changes? or should we prompt the user of the questionnaire about the differences between what is already in the Questionnaire response and what would be prefilled using the CQL logic and let them make a decision? Or should we not run the prefilling logic the second time.</p>",

This can raise an issue if the user consciously wiped it out.  Therefore, if you populate elements on a second pass, you need to warn the user so they know to double-check past answers.</p>",
