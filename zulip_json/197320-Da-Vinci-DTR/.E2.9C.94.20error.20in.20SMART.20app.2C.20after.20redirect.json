        "content": "<p>Looks like this is an issue with the HSPC sandbox and the fact that there is nothing in the SMART app launch specification related to the appContext (it is only mentioned in cds-hooks spec). I've revived a chat in the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179159\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179159-cds-hooks\">#cds hooks</a> stream on this.<br>\nThus, I suspect that passing the order/requestID and the questionnaireURI in the appContext will only work in the RI EHR simulator.<br>\nA workaround is to use an additional query param in the launch url. The app will need to persist the param (e.g. via session storage) in the launch and then retrieve in the redirect. This has worked with Epic and the sandboxes in the past, but is undocumented, so it is better to push for the assumed behaviour to be implemented, as described in the cds specification.</p>",
