I posted my question at <a href=\"https://github.com/IHE/sdpi-fhir/issues/13\">https://github.com/IHE/sdpi-fhir/issues/13</a> (I think this is a good place to post it? lol not sure) .... anyway, I'm trying to wrap my head around this effort and was curious as to whether or not there are any point of care device data generation tools? So for example, 11073-10103 implantable cardiac devices ... is there a way to generate sample data based on this profile to be used as part of the Gemini SDPi+FHIR effort?? I think I'm asking the question correctly lol ... thanks in advance!</p>",
