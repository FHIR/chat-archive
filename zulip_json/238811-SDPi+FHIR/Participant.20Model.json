Thanks</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hi Scott, from my perspective all sample array data can be represented. To touch upon your example, the 12 leads of an ECG would be captured as individual RTSA. Pressure volume loops are a UI thing displaying both RTSA using annotations on the inflection points.</p>",

Thanks</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You did understand everything correct, there will be a message for every mdib version change, but in order to lower the number of messages send a provider typically updates typically multiple containment tree elements in parallel so that multiple changes to the MDIB result only in one MDIB version number increment and hence one message.<br>\nFor example, if 50 measurements are updated, there will be 50 state versions of the metrics updated, but the mdib version will be updated only by 1.</p>",
