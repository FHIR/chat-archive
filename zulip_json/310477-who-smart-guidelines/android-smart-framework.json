This was done in order to satisfy some other Non Functional requirements of the system for which we needed some additional attributes for our View Models of the resources. In addition to that, we also needed additional attributes for User Management models for implementing access protocols at the Role level of the Users. Also we have used the OAuth services of KeyCloak for authorisation of the system that also takes care of the Role based authentication and authorisation. Keeping the additional requirements in mind, we made a decision to go ahead with the custom implementation of KeyCloak using the Java APIs provided by them. </p>\n<p>I agree to your point where we should derive the Pros and Cons of the approaches we take regarding using an existing library. We can create a doc that can mention the Pros and Cons of various approaches and that shall help for future implementations.</p>",

It's a term I borrowed from the CDC's MEDMORPH initiative: <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-medmorph/usecases.html\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-medmorph/usecases.html</a><br>\nThe idea is it's a server to store usable versions of all your FHIR knowledge artifacts (i.e. PlanDefinitions, ActivityDefinitions, ValueSets, etc.) </p>\n<p>Pulling these down from an IG directly seems inefficient to me especially when you have a client communicating with a server. Ideally you'd have 1 central repository of guidelines which could push updates to all instances of a given client that implemented a SMART Guideline. I think it's much simpler from an implementer perspective for implementation and maintenance. Currently there's no way to easily retrieve an entire SMART Guideline except by following the references in the FHIR resources. For example if you got 1 PlanDefinition for ANC and wanted to get the related ValueSets, you'd have to walk the links from the PlanDefinition to the Library, read the CQL, then to the ValueSet. If you did that for every PlanDefinition you'd be making over 200 GET requests. Having a repository with a central location to distribute the guidelines and a FHIR operation to make a single GET of all the artifacts needed to run a CPG is much easier</p>",

We are going with a docker approach and I would like to use the keycloak integration that you guys have done with openSRP. I see that It has 3 java files, one to disable the default security adapter, one to define the keycloak adapter and im not sure what the third one does.<br>\nWe are currently using <a href=\"https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter\">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter</a> docker image and<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Alvearie/keycloak-extensions-for-fhir\">https://github.com/Alvearie/keycloak-extensions-for-fhir</a> . So Im guessing I need to copy these three files into the source code of the hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter and rebuild the docker image? Also are you using the keycloak extensions? Looks like it allows defining scopes based on resource types.
