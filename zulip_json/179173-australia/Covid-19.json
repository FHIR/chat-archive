And it would be great if it is. Awesome.</p>\n<p>But it might not be. Consider: the way the virus works, it takes 10-14 days for any change in behaviour around contagion (e.g. lockdowns Wuhan/European style) to become apparent in the data (consult any of the tracking sites if you're not clear on this).</p>\n<p>So whatever bent the curve this week happened 2 weeks ago. And the government has been clear, to this point, that most of our infections have been overseas driven. And what happened 2 weeks ago? clamping down in incoming cases from USA.</p>\n<p>In the mean time, the virus is out in the wild in Australia, and gradually spreading. The exponential curve is coming for us. Any drop in infection rates due to clamping down on overseas arrivals is transient, and not because we're doing well - we'll be back to 25-30% very soon.</p>\n<p>That's why the government wound up the pressure on social isolation last night, even while the numbers look like they're getting better.</p>\n<p>So, all my Australian friends: expect the numbers to go bad again, and when it happens, know that it isn't because social distancing doesn't work: it does work, but it's very hard work. Unfortunately, we have no choice. There's no quick fix for what ails us right now - no pill to swallow.</p>",

The real disaster is going to be in places like India, South-East Asia, Africa and other locations where there's negligible public health infrastructure and the notion of \"everybody stay home\" simply isn't workable because there's no relief money to send and no means to ensure people get food.  We're not really seeing the number there yet, in part, because they don't have the infrastructure to test.  But I expect those locations are going to do the short-term spike thing where 2/3 of the population will be infected in the first several months, and few of those who need hospitalization will get it.</p>",
