This was the issue I was trying to solve for AMT but perhaps the explicit coding of type/category is useful for other medication terminologies also so maybe keep?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Yes so I had envisaged that I could \"tag\" a code as being a particular level which may correspond to what we call MPP in AMT that is called something else in RxNorm and something else in dm+d. My intention was to tag it with a generic code system that has one code for each possible \"level\" in the union of all \"levels\" across all the drug dictionaries/terminologies.</p>\n<p>I've not updated Medserve to do this yet...but I intended to tag an AMT MPP code with both the generic code I invented and the actual MPP code 30513011000036104 - that way a client can consume it AMT specific or generically. I'd intended to do the same for RxNorm and dm+d when I get around to including them. So it would be possible to write code that was agnostic to the actual underlying code system, or specific to it...whichever suited.</p>\n<p>If I just used the AMT codes for these levels there'd be no chance to write the code generically...of course this is all experimental and hypothetical too.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191342\">@John Grimes</span> may have an opinion too - he's the one that wrote the browser at <a href=\"https://browse.medserve.online\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://browse.medserve.online\">https://browse.medserve.online</a> and therefore has much more experience being a client to this than I do.</p>",
