Grahame created a spreadsheet, but there a few instances of 'Extension on ...' and I'm wondering who should be defining those extension. Because without them people will do bad things, like create a Bundle, with a DocumentManifest which has only one related document, being a Composition, also in the Bundle, and putting the CDA.informationRecipients into DocumentManifest.recipient. O.K. - no foul. I can undo that, but only if I have definition of the NEHTA CDA Extension on Composition for Header.informationRecipient.</p>",
