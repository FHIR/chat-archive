A fair chunk of the search API of Medserve is exposed via the browser, but there's more and you can be quite specific. It is just an extended set of search parameters for the Medication resource where AMT is exposed as a big set of Medication resources. Check out the response resources, all the detail of the AMT concepts are represented in the Medication resources so you can pick out ingredients, strengths, pack sizes...etc...<br>\nIf you can't find what you want through the browser let me know, you might be able to get what you want from the API from <a href=\"https://medserve.online/fhir/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://medserve.online/fhir/\">https://medserve.online/fhir/</a> ...and I can try and add anything that you might need that's missing.</p>",
