I will be porposing a project for that unconference to create an R module that converts FHIR resources to R data-frames, so that you can seamlessly use R analysis against FHIR resources. (and for other uses as well e.g. machine learning, there is an eco-system around data-frames). A few Australian users of FHIR are interested in R. If you are too, you're welcome to join us there</p>",
