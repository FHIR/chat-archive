In addition to a number for dose sequence, Medicare have the idea of \"given at birth\" and \"given as an adult\".  Bizarrely, they consider these to be \"sequences\"!  Clearly they're not, but we do need somewhere to put information like that.  Would that be an extension in <code>Immunisation.vaccinationProtocol</code>?  Thoughts?</p>",

Also, this data is not a general statement about the vaccination and the fact that it should be given at birth, say, but about when the adminstration actually occured.  Given that, I did wonder whether an extension on <code>Immunization.date</code> might be appropriate?</p>",
