The development of the Colorectal and Prostate (radical prostatectomy) are trial developments using FHIR infrastrucutre for the PITUS 15-16 project (working group 5).  <br>\nThese FHIR products will be used with selected private and public pathology laboratories to a selected cancer registry, with the aim to see if :<br>\na) the labs can produce something similar<br>\nb) the cancer registries can consume it<br>\nc) what are the gaps and there will be quite a few and what is the best way forward.<br>\nThe College of American Pathologists (CAP) used their own codes, but we've tried using LOINC and SCT where codes are available and because the content of each cancer protocol is different ie the Pathologist say that the cancer staging etc is different from one cancer protocol to another and therefore there is very little commonality between protocols.  Basically all questions (usually LOINC) and answers (usually SCT) are protocol specific and hence there are lots of gaps in the current available terminologies for each specific cancer protocol.<br>\nThere are NEHTA/ADHA terminology specialists involved in mapping the answers eg procedure type, procedure site etc, for the colorectal and prostate cancers to SCT and there will be a number of codes available following the next SCT-AU release.<br>\nThe made up codes are there just to provide content and it is envisaged that they will be replaced with appropriate SCT and LOINC codes in due course.<br>\nThe ADHA/Agency (apparently we aren't allowed to use ADHA as an acronym as it is trademarked somewhere else) terminology staff know the Nebraska team and communicate regularly with them via an IHTSDO teleconference, hence I'm sure they'll be collaborating appropriately on this.  I understand the Nebraska team would like to see the cancer specific terminology elevated to the international SCT edition rather than just SCT-AU.  However, I'll leave that with the Agency terminology people to progress/discuss.<br>\nYes  - I agree the output to date is developing and it will be some time before the products and process will be fully defined, but progress is being made and we'll know a lot more following the trials with the selected pathology providers and the selected cancer registry.<br>\nI'm happy to hear any feedback as we are all looking to making the structured cancer protocols more usable.</p>",
