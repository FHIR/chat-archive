I presume the main problem here is that <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2016May\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2016May\">http://hl7.org/fhir/2016May</a> is not really a FHIR server, right?  However, I'm curious about this because GET &lt;FHIR server&gt;/Patient will give me all patients, but StuctureDefinition, being a StructureDefinition is slightly different to (nearly) all other resources.  I would assume that GET &lt;FHIR server&gt;/StructureDefinition should return a list a GET &lt;FHIR server&gt;/StructureDefinition/StructureDefinition should return StructureDefinition.  Anyone got any ideas?</p>",
