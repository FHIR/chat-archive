It complains because the hl7.fhir.au.base documents the dependency:  \"hl7.fhir.r4.core\": \"4.0.0\".  OK - I need to first import hl7.fhir.r4.core v4.0.0.</p>\n<p>however - searching <a href=\"http://registry.fhir.org\">registry.fhir.org</a>, I cannot find this version.  All that is published version hl7.fhir.r4.core: 4.0.1.</p>\n<p>Is the hl7.fhir.au.base dependency incorrect (should it point to 4.0.1?).  If not - where can I get hl7.fhir.r4.core version 4.0.0 ??<br>\nthanks -</p>",

You've become a victim of the FHIR Core still having been able to 'retract' the 4.0.0 version, since it was never published in the package server and your package having been published with that dependency...<br>\nThe package ecosystem is made exactly to prevent these kinds of deleted dependencies (published packages will never be deleted), so this shouldn't happen in the future.</p>\n<p>The only option is to bring out a new version of the packages with the missing dependency, with an updated dependency on the core package. The FHIR package spec currently doesn't have a generic definition of unlisting/deprecating packages, but that would probably be best to do with of those current versions.</p>",
