There is *some\" specification and clarity, but it's not easy to find! :-)) What's really  good to see is a discussion about binding, 'cos I think this will help specify what refsets are needed/justified/reusable/shareable (or not) and might help prevent the sort of redundancy I'm seeing, where the content intersections between refsets sometimes exceed 80% and everyone thinks they'll got a better refset/subset/shortlist.... Terminology servers, along with constraint languages/techniques will make the build of new refsets less of a burden (*I hope*) :-)....  My only concern is whether there is a fundamental misunderstanding between what a refset really is, and what a subset is, and what a shortlist is....and what the impacts and implications are. It's not my experience that the majority of people 'get it' (yet).  </p>",

The (pragmatic) working definitions, that I find helpful are : RefSet, a prioritisation of some (SNOMED) terms via a filter, boosting, dynamic constraints (or indeed deprecating some) from within a standard corpus (perhaps one axis), where the entire corpus remains available and is considered valid.  A subset is a strict enumeration of 'valid' terms only, where any term NOT in the subset is by definition NOT valid and NOT available.  A shortlist - a  very cut-down version of a subset, where the content is limited to what can fit on screen real estate or a drop down list for selection. This is NOT to say that subsets and shortlists don't have a place and are not warranted - they ARE of course.
