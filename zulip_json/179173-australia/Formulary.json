We've talked to them and there's been some preliminary/trial mapping exercises with AMT, but I think they were still trying to figure out the business model to cover the costs of maintaining something like that. We've also worked with them on developing CALS (cautionary and advisory labels).</p>\n<p>But as far as I know there's no official plans yet to for the APF to use AMT codes or expose anything using FHIR.</p>\n<p>Did you have anything in particular in mind?</p>",
