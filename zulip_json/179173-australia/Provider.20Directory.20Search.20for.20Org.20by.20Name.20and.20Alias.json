I think this is at least a Should and quite possibly a Shall requirement. 2) For convenience of my users, I might like to make a one-step way to search on both name and alias (instead of making them remember / discover and then OR those two attributes). Opinions on building that kind of convenience query? Best practices around that kind of thing?</p>",
