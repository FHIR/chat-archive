I guess it just looks funny to me... when I look at the spec page, it reads (to me) that specialty is \"preferred\" to be coded with the HL7 value set (which itself is a US artifact I helped create a long time ago and therefore of questionable value in AU), but it's \"required\" to be coded with the SNOMED value set. To get the intent that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191367\">@Brian Postlethwaite</span>  describes above, would it be better to put the required SNOMED at/near the top of the slice and then include an Extension to allow an optional local coding to be specified by the user? That model is used for some of the identifier slices in this group of profiles (although without the added constraint of a value set binding).</p>",
