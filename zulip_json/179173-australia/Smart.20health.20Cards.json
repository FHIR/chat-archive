In NZ, we have 'Pfizer/BioNTech' as the term for CVX 208 on our Vaccination Cards, but it's not actually the name of the vaccine. Both the long, short and product names contain 'COVID-19' see <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/COVID-19-related-codes.html\">here</a>. So I'd suggest using 'Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine' rather than 'Pfizer (Comirnaty)' which is a manufacturer and trade name'.</p>",
