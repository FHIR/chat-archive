In <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191368\">@Brett Esler</span>'s example the code has 2 parts: \"101\" which means \"Section\" and \"16117\" which means \"Medical History\", i.e. this is the code for the Medical History section.  In the case of Medical History, the concept is unique, but we have many data components for which the name/code is not unique, thus requiring the data component type as a differentiator.  This means, that the purist way of representing these codes would be fuller URLs and shorter codes -- <a href=\"http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/ci/dc/sctn\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/ci/dc/sctn\">http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/ci/dc/sctn</a> as the URL &amp; \"16117\" as the code in this example.  Is there any appetite for doing this \"properly?\"  Perhaps it would be too hard anyway because you'd have to have smarter code if you were working with both CDA and FHIR?</p>",
