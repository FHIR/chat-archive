Then the broader community would only need ONE concept map between person-Sex-code N and SNOMED. Just as an aside, Meteor needs some cleaning up, for internal consistency purposes, and to help drive developers toward standards that help interoperability (given this single example, it looks more like a smorgasbord menu - pick one, any one).</p>",
