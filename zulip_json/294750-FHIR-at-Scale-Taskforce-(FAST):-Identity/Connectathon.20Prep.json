In this case should more than one match be permitted and do we want to just increase the permitted count to represent that, or should count=1 be clarified as meaning \"1 result per source\"? The latter seems more in line with what we intend.</p>",

Since the profiling work in the $match part of the Identity IG relates substantively to parameter characteristics, that type of input is excellent and definitely welcomed. If interested parties would like to identify a subset of the afternoon time where they are interested in focused discussion on attributes, I'll post the hour time slots here and those with availability constraints might thumbs-up preferred times.</p>",
