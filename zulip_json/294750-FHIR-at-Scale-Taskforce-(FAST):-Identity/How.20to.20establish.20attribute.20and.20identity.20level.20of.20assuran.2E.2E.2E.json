        "content": "<p>FAST Identity's recommended solutions for patient matching contain requirements that matching attributes are validated prior to including them in a match request. Building out a workflow for this, at today's connectathon we had a lengthy discussion of where to begin when assembling attributes to include in a cross-organization patient match request. The two main conversation threads were: 1) Is there a level to the broader patient record that we can use? To synthesize this, we might add an Identifier to the Patient resource that has an associated identity level of assurance and find a way to indicate which attributes in the record may be considered at that level. (This might be very difficult to understand the meaning of, for existing health records, unless an identity level of assurance is maintained from the inception of a subject’s health record; perhaps \"HIPAA\" LoA is a baseline assumption for any health record today; TBD what that means about any given attribute in the record, though.) 2) Does identity assurance &amp; attribute verification make sense only in the context of specific Encounters or other more discrete parts of the record? (As in the current SHC implementation, where the Immunization encounter includes a meta security tag for identity assurance level which informs identity assurance of name, DOB.) Certain Encounters (or other FHIR resources?) may be noteworthy as meriting inclusion of an identity level of assurance moreso than others. If an encounter can be like a “re-registration” or reset/identity \"step up\", a best practice might be to require that subsequent activity in the health record is at that same level of identity assurance. Some of the work to do will involve interpreting and managing identity assurance in a health record over time.

(e.g., the home address put in by someone just listening to the patient say their home address is less LOA, than an organization with policy and procedure that has the registration clerks as the only ones that can change the home address and they only change the address when they confirm the address given is on a federal or state issued identity card) (PS. I hope no one has either of those policies). The home address format here is not the question, the LOA comes from the policy and process.<br>\nIn healthcare today, we have survived nicely with an implied high LOA simply because getting these personal identity details right is important to the business of healthcare (follow the $$$). as other parties are added to the conversation, the priority is not as well aligned so some other mechanism is needed.</p>",

For example, what attributes, verified to be consistent with an IAL2 proofing event, would an IdP need to share with a health system to give confidence that a certain unique individual patient is the user behind an Individual Access request and allow release to this user of any of the health data about that patient that is stored by the health system? Likely the vaccination related workflow where more limited PHI is shared, has less stringent minimum attribute requirements. Both cases may recommend \"all available data so verified\" but writing up a few patterns helps participants know what to expect if what's \"available\" is going to be too little for the responder to have sufficient confidence in their match to release any health data.</p>",

This makes it difficult for $match to consider identities as opposed to records – an identity is a set of records that is partitioned together as being the same person. Other systems compute this partitioning as records arrive and satisfy $match by searching the identities, not simply the records. This allows for advance manual stewardship on the partitioning and more sophisticated matching concepts (identity-to-identity vs record-to-record). It also impacts the semantics of the $match parameter:</p>\n<p>IN  onlyCertainMatches 0..1 boolean -&gt; If there are multiple potential matches, then the match should not return the results with this flag set to true. When false, the server may return multiple results with each result graded accordingly.</p>\n<p>The problem is that a system that considers records only will often have multiple records that appear to strongly match the input and likely represent the same person, making it very hard to find a person when using this parameter.</p>\n<p>Is an implementation of $match that does not partition the existing records into identities even consistent with $match semantics?

It does not mean \"one Patient resource\" or \"one Patient identifier\". It means (I assert) all the identies you return must be considered by YOU to be the same single patient. Which is how IHE defines it in PIX, you can return multiple identifier/id values; but they must all be considered by the responding system/organization/community to be the same patient (at this time).  <br>\n   see IHE specification on this kind of environment in FHIR -- <a href=\"https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/PIXm/index.html\">https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/PIXm/index.html</a><br>\nThe drawback of this is that the client must then query against every one of these, thus some might really want \"single patient match\" to mean \"one Patient identifier\", because the client in that case wants to query the community only once.  In this definition, the community you describe simply has to invent yet-another-identifier-for-this-patient and return that. There is an infinite number of numbers, so we are not going to run out of identifiers. But it places a burden on the community to have yet-another-identifier-for-this-patient.

That does not seem logical to me. Situations at the requesting side might fit only one of those choices. The ultimate policy might be decided nationally, for a community, or for a transaction.

This builds on recommendations from work we researched in 2018-2019, including \"A Framework for Cross-Organizational Patient Identity Management\" by Sequoia, RAND's \"Defining and Evaluating Patient-Empowered Approaches to Improving Record Matching\", and the GAO's \"Approaches and Challenges to Electronically Matching Patients’ Records across Providers.\"</p>\n<p>Level of link assurance - or match confidence - came up multiple times; there was interest from stakeholders in guidance for establishing match confidence in a reproducible way. For example, what constitutes a confidence of 0.2? 0.9? And at what level can data be released directly to a consumer user, as a Certain/Single High-threshold match? </p>\n<p>Also discussed the necessity of knowing what level of assurance attributes have been verified at, either by community policy, in user profile info for introspection, or in an assertion object. (Is there a need to express as part of $match - i.e. in patient resource data?)</p>\n<p>Participants raised that multiple results seem OK when an aggregator is providing results from multiple organizations, implying that 1-result per organization is expected for targeted queries. We would appreciate hearing from entities that are unable to manage FHIR results grouped by real world identity, since it is sounding like the community expects this.</p>\n<p>The use of $match and profiling of interoperable $match for use across organizational boundaries was positively received as being capable of more than a search string. <a href=\"#narrow/search/mpi-match\">This topic</a> includes additional background.</p>\n<p>Identity verification was discussed at different levels 1) for the business authenticating to the transaction 2) for the consumer authenticating to the transaction, if any and 3) for attributes about the subject that are included in a match request. Generally #3 is the focus of the scenarios we're testing at this connectathon, though the special case of #2 comes up in Tiered OAuth and may be asserted by the business that is authenticating itself as in #1.</p>\n<p>Specific to identity verification, we discussed IAL1.8 for patient access to their own data (2 Fairs--for example, two of: photo ID, medical record, insurance card OR a gov't issued photo ID + mobile number billed to the person). One stakeholder offered that they require IAL2 for patient access but that they have also discussed how an insurance card might be used. </p>\n<p>Of the required, verified attribute combinations a-f that we've discussed previously in this topic, combo (d) was discussed as resonating with stakeholders -- {First, Last, DOB, Street Address, City, State}  though instead of Address/City/State one participant noted they (Commonwell) require zip code plus self-asserted gender plus one of: {Street Address Line 1 OR email OR phone}.</p>\n<p>There is interest in guidance being written about use of a minimum bar as well as a maximum bar of attributes provided in matching. For example, under what circumstances are elements like blood type relevant/permitted, or should there be a maximum set of permitted attributes? We have also discussed a similar topic in FAST Identity: use of biometrics and any best practices or uses that are not recommended? In both cases this topic has privacy considerations to be addressed.</p>\n<p>We also heard from at least one stakeholder who does not operate a FHIR server but would like to benefit from the IG elements we are writing in guidance about.</p>\n<p>The conversation today provided rich discussion &amp; I welcome others to join us tomorrow from 1-3 Eastern, reply to pieces here as they interest you, or join in on our <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PA/Interoperable+Digital+Identity+and+Patient+Matching+Capabilities\">HL7 Workgroup meetings</a>...</p>",

I would advise checking at least the eIDAS specification (<a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation\">https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation</a>) which is an EU wide scheme, being adopted quite widely.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Question for you: are you aware of a best practice document for patient matching (I guess it would just be called lookup if the identifier is nationwide) across facilities within Finland (or between countries) that you or others would point to as a reference we can add to our collection? For example, are matches just on the identifier permitted, or is some minimal demographic data required to prevent errors due to mis-typing of the identifier? Thanks again!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't know of such a document, or any requirements for demographic data. The personal identifiers I know of have a checksum character included that protects against mis-typing well enough. For the Finnish national identifier see <a href=\"https://dvv.fi/en/personal-identity-code\">https://dvv.fi/en/personal-identity-code</a>. Recently the debate has rather been whether the identifier itself exposes too much information. It is formed from the birth date and sex, and both are clearly readable from the identifier. The fact that these pieces are visible could be considered as additional protection against errors, but that point has not been raised in any of the discussions I've followed. Sex change is one of the pressing problems - if you change your sex, do you get a new identifier, and what happens to all the services where you have been registered with your old one...</p>\n<p>Also, it's nowadays quite common that no-one types your identifier, rather it is read from a bar code of your social security card or drivers' license. Or even more commonly, you use an identification service on your mobile (provided by your bank or mobile operator, it's up to you to choose which service you want to use, they are interoperable), with two-factor authentication (you have the device with the app where you've signed in, and you confirm with a pin code or your fingerprint), and the identifier is transferred as a parameter from the identification service to the service requiring identification or authentication.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Another conversation we are discussing - this from an email sent by a participant who is not on Zulip; I believe we have some older research on how attribute verification impacts matching but will leave this for others who have anecdotal information to share or who may have specific references to cite, or other comments about the questions posed below: </p>\n<p>\"I also share the concern that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"434779\">@Richard Hornaday</span> brought up that we want to avoid going into security concerns if possible because it is simply too large a scope to take on. I think at most we want to address security where it overlaps with matching. Here's some thought on that overlap:</p>\n<p>Suppose a person has a verified digital identity where he has shown that he possesses a given phone and email account.<br>\nKnowing that a phone and email have been verified might be very useful to matching. Specifically, such a phone is almost certainly an individual cell phone, as opposed to a group phone for the family or at the fire station where the person works. Such an email is more likely to be a personal email rather than the shared family email. Those properties would help you discern that these two records are for the same person despite their differences:</p>\n<p>Simpson, Homer, 1992-02-23, 101 Springfield Lane APT 23, (412)2311456 (verified) <a href=\"mailto:homer@simpson.com\">homer@simpson.com</a> (verified)<br>\nSimpson, Homey, 1992-05-23, 101 Springfield Lane, (412)2311456  <a href=\"mailto:homer@simpson.com\">homer@simpson.com</a></p>\n<p>Without that extra information, it might be easy to conclude that these records might represent siblings or something.</p>\n<p>On the other hand</p>\n<p>Simpson, Bart, 1012-02-23 101 Springfield Lane APT 23, (412)2311456  <a href=\"mailto:homer@simpson.com\">homer@simpson.com</a></p>\n<p>Still probably doesn't link with either Homer because of the generational difference in DOB and the propensity of using the father's phone and email for a child.</p>\n<p>Moreover, if we had two verified identities<br>\n                Bouvier, Marge, 1992-08-14, 3424 Duff Lane, (412)5513467 (verified),  <a href=\"mailto:margyB@yahoo.com\">margyB@yahoo.com</a> (verified)<br>\n                Simpson, Marge, 1992-08-14,  101 Springfield Lane APT 23, (412)2525555 (verified) <a href=\"mailto:margyB@yahoo.com\">margyB@yahoo.com</a> (verified)</p>\n<p>Then we could be extra sure that these are the same person, despite the change of name, address and phone given that we have strong reason to believe that this is a personal email.</p>\n<p>A particularly interesting case is when the information in one record, including verified contacts, and pseudo secrets like an SSN indicate that the person behind that record could have created a digital identity corresponding to the other record in the other system, based on what they proved for the first system. At that point, one might say the correspondence goes beyond \"probabilistic matching\".</p>\n<p>But note that this is pretty wild speculation on my part – I haven't actually tried to incorporate such information in matching, I've never had that kind of information available and I haven't analyzed the statistics on how that should score. That's one reason why I've shied away from talking about Identity that much – I don't actually know how it affects matching. Does anybody?</p>\n<p>Finally, I've collected some of the guidance points I've suggested earlier into a powerpoint, <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/R4u-euEGYudbx4tQXXWkfCjv/MatchGuidance-1.pptx\">attached</a> .\"</p>",
