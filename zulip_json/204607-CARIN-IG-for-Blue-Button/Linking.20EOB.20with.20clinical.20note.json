Alternatively an implementer could possibly add such documentation to the ExplanationOfBenefit.supportingInfo.valueReference or valueAttachment where the ExplanationofBenefit.category would classify the type of information provided.</p>\n<p>Now, for the caveat: There are several ways this sort of information may be provided or retrieved. The ExplanationOfBenefit supportingInfo can be used for many classes of data. Without further definition by a supported IG or by a server explicitly, it might not be possible to find or discern the meaning or purpose of such information.</p>\n<p>In short: This sort of clinical information is not within the scope of the CARIN BB IG. While the IG does not disallow linking or otherwise providing such information, I would not expect a server supporting CARIN BB alone to make that information available.</p>\n<p>That being said, I would be interested in hearing about the use case.</p>",
