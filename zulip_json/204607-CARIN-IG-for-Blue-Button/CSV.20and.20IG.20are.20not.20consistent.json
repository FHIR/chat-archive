For example, looking at Coverage.class:group.type, there are attributes such as id, extension, and coding in the structure definition (<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/StructureDefinition-CARIN-BB-Coverage.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/StructureDefinition-CARIN-BB-Coverage.html</a>) yet in the CSVs those attributes are missing.  Is this intentional, an issue with the slicing build in the CSVs, or a concept that I am missing.  Appreciate the assistance.</p>",

As Ryan and Saul have mentioned we will be updating and synchronizing the IG artifacts to remove the inconsistencies/ambiguities especially regarding the profile elements that are in-scope for the IG and their mapping from CPCDS. As a heads up, we will primarily be using the \"Must Support\" flag to designate the profile elements in-scope for the IG and including those in the mapping.</p>",
