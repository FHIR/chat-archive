        "content": "<p>Based upon some of the questions we had at the connectathon and discussions with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"195439\">@Cloud Cray</span>  there is some questions and limitations with the coverage resource. <br>\n1.) It will not be possible to use the coverage resource to determine any cost of care information, even for simple things like office visits since the amount applied toward deductible and maximumoutofpocket is not tracked. </p>\n<p>2.) The coverage resource does not contain all of the information that can be communicated using a 271 eligibility response transaction. It will not be possible to use the coverage resource to determine procedure/device/medication/etc costs. There was talks of using the eligibility response FHIR resource to fill this gap. </p>\n<p>3.) It does not seem that we can accurately represent an instance of coverage using the coverage resource. It may be good to include additional info in the “costToBeneficiary” collection of this resource. For example, we can indicate that there is a $25 office visit cost, but I do not see any way to indicate that the office visit cost only applies once the deductible has been met. As another example, it could be that a member receives two free office visits each year, even if the deductible has not been met. The “exception“ element seems like a good place to indicate this, but the specified valueset only allows for retired and foster care exceptions. </p>\n<p>4.) It seems that the only way to accurately capture plan information in cases where a certain coverage policy contains multiple benefits would be to create multiple coverage resources for a single policy. For example, a medical plan will have different benefit levels for in-network vs out-of-network. There may also be different benefits that are bundled in with a policy, e.g. limited dental benefits that are included under a medical plan.</p>",

There are various use cases where the same information contained in the 271 would be VERY useful to client apps looking to give data from payers to patients. I am proposing we take a look at those use cases -many of which are new - and \"future proof\" what we do now to avoid conflicts later on.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the I don't believe the \"costToBeneficiary\" field - which was added between versions 3/4 - belongs on the coverage resource.
