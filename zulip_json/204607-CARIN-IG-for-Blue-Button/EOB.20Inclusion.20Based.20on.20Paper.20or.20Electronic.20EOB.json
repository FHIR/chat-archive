I'm just concerned that I am not interpreting your answer correctly or I am not stating my question clearly.  We populate the CARIN Explanation of Benefit profiles using adjudicated claim data.  We can provide this data prior to an EOB being produced for that claim, almost immediately after adjudication.  Someone indicated, though, that we may need to wait until after the EOB itself has been produced.  I'm not referring to the creation of  a claim profile.</p>",
