I get an error when processing this resource - \"id\": \"<strong>explanationofbenefit-service-date</strong>\".</p>\n<p>I noticed that the \"xpath\" element is different than any other SearchParameter I've seen in either CARIN or US Core.  It seems to use \"|\" characters to try and overload multiple different possible xpaths.</p>\n<p>\"xpath\": \"f:ExplanationOfBenefit/f:billablePeriod | f:ExplanationOfBenefit/f:serviced/f:servicedDate | f:ExplanationOfBenefit/f:serviced/f:servicedPeriod\",</p>\n<p>I looked into the definition of SearchParameter to see if this was allowed if my system should be able to handle this structure but I didn't see any mention of this being allowed (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/searchparameter-definitions.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/searchparameter-definitions.html</a>).</p>\n<p>I can work around this by picking one of those 3 items in the xpath and removing the other 2 but clearly the authors wanted you to be able to find the service date in multiple locations.</p>\n<p>Is this going to be changed?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>Fred</p>",
