        "content": "<p>Hello - I've had the following working assumption:  if you have a claim in your system that was processed as a capitated claim by the payor - then any fields related to \"costs borne by the payer\" could be sent (per the CARIN BB IG) as $0. Basically - does this reasoning align with others?   I know there is the concept of so-called \"shadow costs\" (that is: conveying what WOULD have been the cost paid to the member or provider IF the clam was fee-for-service\" - but I'm thinking that it would be equally legitimate to send $0 via the API.  Example: say a provider is paid a Per Member Per Month capitation fee to cover all services.  However the payer contractually obligates the provider to file a \"zero pay claim\" for each provider/patient encounter.  The resulting claim is not paid by the payor - but the data is essentially the same as if it were a claim to be paid.</p>",
