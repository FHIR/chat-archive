Unfortunately that cardinality (of 1..1) is set by the base Resource in FHIR R4. <br>\nFor the upcoming technical correction to STU1, we will be adding the Data Absent Reason \"not-applicable\" code to the ValueSet specifically for Inpatient Institutional.<br>\nSee: <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30357\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30357</a> <br>\nIn the future, a request has been made to the HL7 Financial Management Workgroup, which manages the ExplanationOfBenefit resource, to relax the cardinality to 0..1 for FHIR R5.<br>\nSee: <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30333\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30333</a></p>",
