The constraint is if we implement the discriminator slices, (denialreason and allowedunits) but if you are implementing the 'subslices' like submitted, copay, etc it doesn't apply.<br>\nWe are also trying to figure this out ourselves, we're not sure how the slices work - is it that when the claim is denied we use the discriminator slices else we go with the subslices. In c4bb examples, we don't see any discriminator slices.</p>",
