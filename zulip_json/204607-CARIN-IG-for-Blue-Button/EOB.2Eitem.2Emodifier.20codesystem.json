So in principle these two codesystems have been separated by there individual URLs. <br>\nBut in case of EOB.item.modifier -level I as well as Level -II modifier codes, have been assigned same URLs: <a href=\"http://www.ama-assn.org/go/cpt\">http://www.ama-assn.org/go/cpt</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets\">http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets</a>. Yes , the modifiers have been assigned an individual valueset URL but while performing lookup on the codesystem common URls clash. Is there a reason to assign the modifiers same URLS? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191529\">@Corey Spears</span></p>",

I would think that the serviceOrProcedure code would be the subset of codes that are the procedure  type codes, and the modifier would be the subset of them that are modifier type codes.</p>",

Is there a ValueSet defined for modifier codes alone? Unfortunately we do not have permission to publish CPT codes, so we can't create a ValueSet of defined codes. Even if we did, maintaining the ValueSet would be a challenge. We would need to point to some sort of authoritative source that maintains them over time. If there is, we are definitely interested in knowing about it so we can consider a tighter binding.</p>",

The urls were provided to the HL7 Terminology Authority by the owning authorities, the AMA and CMS.  Unfortunately, the best way to differentiate between a procedure code and a modifiers code is the length of the value; procedure codes are five positions; modifiers are two positions.
