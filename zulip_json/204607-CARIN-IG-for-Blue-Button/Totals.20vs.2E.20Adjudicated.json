It wasn't clear to me how the data maps, as the mapping spreadsheet states that all amounts go into adjudicated, but then says something about total amounts being filled with totals also. I apologize if this is being handled somewhere, but I wasn't able to find anything in Jira related to it. Is this question still being researched or did I miss some explanation posted some place?</p>",
