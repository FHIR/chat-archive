        "content": "<p>Hello. I was hoping someone might help clear up some confusion for me. It seems like version v0.1.0 of the CARIN guide , it was acceptable to have EOB as its own profile that can be requested by consuming apps. Is that correct? It seems like the build version changes it so that it is an abstract profile that cannot be requested and only is used as a basis for other profiles. I just want to make sure that the intent of the EOB base profile changed and NOT that it was always intended to work as an abstract. Thank you for your help.</p>",

I think part of the confusion is the example provided for 0.1.0 seems to be for eob base and not for any of the other profiles.  Plus, the CARIN mapping PPT indicates that the EOB base could be its own profile. Moreover, if there isn't a generic profile, then how would dental claims get classified?   Would they come back on the professional profile?   Yet, the capability statement doesn't have it as a supporting profile so there seems to be a conflict.</p>",

It is much appreciated.  If the profiles are not ready, then wouldn't we need to use EOB base in order to provide data for dental and vision claims in time for 1/1 or would we need to use the professional profile in the meanwhile, in spite of the definition for that profile?  Also, if EOB base was never intended to be a profile that stands alone, then do you know why the guide has an  EOB base example?  Thank you.</p>",
