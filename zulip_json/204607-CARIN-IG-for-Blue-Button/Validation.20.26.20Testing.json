Our plan was to utilize Touchstone as they appear to have a group of tests for Patient Access conformance (US Core, Formulary, Provider Directory) .  This group of tests seems to be missing anything related to testing EOB and Claims.  Does anyone have insight into this?  </p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",

I'll just have to keep an eye on Touchstone to see if they come up with a more formal test suite in the future.</p>",
