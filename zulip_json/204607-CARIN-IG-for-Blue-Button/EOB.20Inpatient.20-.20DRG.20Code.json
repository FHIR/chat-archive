A couple of questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the IG, I see the code system is CMS-DRG, so we are assuming CARIN just wants the CMS/MS DRG codes and not the AP DRG codes which are a different set. Can you verify this assumption?</li>\n<li>We also have multiple MS-DRG codes, we have a Submitted DRG code which is the one sent in by the provider and an Adjudicated DRG code that could be a corrected DRG code from the adjudication process. We are assuming CARIN wants the Adjudicated DRG code. Can you verify this assumption?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thank you,<br>\nJoel</p>",
