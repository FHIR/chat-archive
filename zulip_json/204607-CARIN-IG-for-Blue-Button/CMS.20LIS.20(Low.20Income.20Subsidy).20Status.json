(1.0 or 2.0)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am struggling with the same question of how to convey the CMS LIS status of a patient (this includes what I understand to be the low income subsidy % - e.g., a percentage value of 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%) via. FHIR/BlueButton data.   Some have proposed using Coverage.class with a Coverage.class.type of class or subclass (<a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/2.1.0/CodeSystem-coverage-class.html\">Coverage Class Codes</a>#class \"Class\" or subclass \"SubClass\"), <a href=\"http://Coverage.class.name\">Coverage.class.name</a> = 'Low Income Subsidy' &amp; Coverage.class.value = <em>&lt;LIS %&gt;</em> (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75% or 100%).   However, this doesn't feel right, and it does not covey the 'Low Income Subsidy' concept via. a CodeableConcept.   </p>\n<p>Would extending the <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/2.1.0/CodeSystem-coverage-class.html\">Coverage Class Codes</a> (extensible) to include a 'lis' (LowIncomeSubsidy) code be an option?   For example:</p>\n<p>Coverage.class.type.coding.code = 'lis'<br>\nCoverage.class.type.coding.display = 'LowIncomeSubsidy'<br>\nCoverage.class.value = <em>&lt;LIS %&gt;</em> (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75% or 100%)</p>",

(Or let me know if you can't or would prefer not to and I will do it for you.)<br>\nNote that if you do feel it is appropriate to place it in the Coverage.class, the slicing is open, so you could technically place it in there, but that of course would be undefined by the standard.</p>",
