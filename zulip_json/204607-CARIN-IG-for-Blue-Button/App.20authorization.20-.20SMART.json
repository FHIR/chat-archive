Health plans need to implement the SMART App Launch Framework standalone launch sequence similar to what the provider community has implemented to support user authentication. This is critically important for multiple reasons including: the health care app community uses today as the central way in which they are authenticating users, it's a proven framework that is working in production today, and it's the primary way a health plan/data holder will know the request is coming from an individual by leveraging the member portal UN/PW for authentication.</p>",

While working with couple of States, we realize that most of them dont have an existing Member (Patient) Portal where members have already registered and have existing user credentials. OAuth and OpenID Connect standards do expect a member to have their user credentials already set up with the healhplan (State Medicaid in this case) before they can utilize the third party app to access their health data through API. I was wondering if you have any recommendation for patient authentication flow in these circumstances. </p>\n<p>When there is already an existing member portal credential available, we are designing the API so that member can authenticate themselves by providing the userid and password of their Member portal account.</p>",
