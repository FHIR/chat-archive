For these claim types, we are coming up with a best approach of how to include them in the various CARIN EOB profiles (either Inpatient or  Outpatient). We are considering looking at other claim criteria, like the Beginning Date of Service and Ending Date of Service. If the dates are the same we would consider it as an Inpatient else it would be an Outpatient.</p>\n<p>I just wanted to check with the group if others are having similar issues classifying inpatient vs. outpatient and what approaches are being used? </p>\n<p>Thank you,<br>\nJoel</p>",

The determination would be made as payers adjudicate claims as the reimbursement methodologies and benefits applied are typically different.   The two profiles were separated due to the differences in value set binding requirements; for example, inpatient requires ICD procedure codes and DRGs; outpatient does not.   <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191912\">@Michele Mottini</span> The EOB.type values align with those defined by HL7.  Do requestors need to differentiate between the two institutional data they receive?  If so, a recommendation would be to define a subtype with fixed values inpatient institutional and outpatient institutional respectively for the two profiles.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192132\">@Amol Vyas</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"296344\">@Joel Hansen (Aetna)</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197108\">@Jason Teeple</span></p>",
