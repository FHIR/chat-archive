I am trying to locate a schema which represents what the FHIR server is going to look for as a format. For baseline resources, this is found by looking at the XML tab where the resource is defined. Structure | UML | XML | JSON ... etc. Where can I find the schema for these profiles? I checked the \"XML\" at the top of the page, but it seems to be a definition of the entire profile, not a schema to map to. Thanks!</p>\n<p>ANSWERED - Thank you</p>",
