We have our own FHIR Endpoint directory at <a href=\"https://api.fhirfly.io/network/Endpoint\">https://api.fhirfly.io/network/Endpoint</a> .   Right now this is the list of Epic FHIR servers (anyone who wants their organization added please contact me). Our question is who is the source of truth for this information? Who is the gatekeeper on which servers/apps are listed and which are not? For now we will keep building our own. But we call for a transparent no cost process to getting listed and some kind of system for replication of this data akin to DNS.  Thoughts?</p>",

At CARIN, we anticipate multiple private sector end point directories in the market. The ONC and MITRE end point directory provides an open framework for others to use. It's our understanding thought that the ONC/MITRE directory will not be proactively capturing payer end points. Unfortunately, the CAQH press release wasn't clear. It seemed to indicate that CARIN endorsed the CAQH end point directory as the only one payers should use. It should be noted that we did not approve the language in the press release before it was issued. It also should be noted that since we began, CARIN does not endorse any specific vendor's product or service offering. We are vendor, technology, and product agnostic. We always have been and always will be. Our hope is the industry can self-organize around a common approach for developing an end point directory the everyone can follow. We would also agree being listed in the end point directory and having access to that information should be a public good otherwise it creates perverse incentives in the market. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"396697\">@Richard Braman (FLY.HEALTH)</span> we would welcome the opportunity to chat about the directory you have put together. Can you ping me offline so we can set-up a time to chat?</p>",
