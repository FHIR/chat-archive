Only one version of each resource is supplied.   Sometimes the reference is to /2, and the data provided is /3.</p>\n<p>·       EOB item.adjudication.amount should have a $ value</p>\n<p>·       EOB.item.modifier includes only system</p>\n<p>·       EOB.item.locationCodeableConcept includes only system</p>\n<p>·       Profile compliance includes both abstract base profile,and concrete profile, which is unnecessary.</p>\n<p>·       EOB.procedures include references to devices (e.g., 261352009) not procedures.</p>\n<p>·       Some references to Patient are versioned (Coverage), and others aren't (EOB)</p>\n<p>·       Display values (e.g., Organization, benefit category) are just the resources ID.
