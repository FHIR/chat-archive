But it's not a SHALL kinda' thing.</p>\n<p>Any clarifications or thoughts or additional context I'm missing?</p>",

Davis</span> The way the IG is currently published the only way to resolve a referenced resource is through the use of includes. We would more closely follow other FHIR implementations if we required support for reads of supporting resources. E.g. if I give you a resource reference for Practitioner/123 the expectation is that you should be able to resolve that resource id. If you included the practitioner as something other than a reference i would not expect to be able to independently read the underlying resource.</p>",
