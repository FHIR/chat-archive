This should not have any implementation burden and will increase alignment with US Core patients. I hope that as the IG discussions develop we can help define some cross-system compatible identifiers (patient identifiers that will help locate a patient across systems). There are options for consumers to select and provide a voluntary \"identity-proofed\" value too, which is why I thought this will fit under CARIN.\" </p>\n<p>A search by patient is not defined in the CARIN IG.  The patientID is locked down after the member authenticates.
