In addition to the CMS Medicare Blue Button API data model, the CARIN IG 's CPCDS is also informed by Cambia/Regence's Facets data model. However, if you know Facets, its deployments can vary greatly. Given this, it would be nice to get Cognizant's feedback on the IG. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196361\">@Ryan Howells</span> ?</p>",

I spoke to them this week and they are indicating it will be difficult to map directly  from their source system to FHIR. I'm encouraging them to try and make that happen. Your initial mapping <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191912\">@Michele Mottini</span> will hopefully help.</p>",
