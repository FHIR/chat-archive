This connectathon definitely helped us test our fhir implementation of Carin and our Smart auth flow.  We found a few issues and will be able to improve as a result.</p>\n<p>I appreciated the sessions dedicated to talking about the CarinBB IG, examples, touchstone testing, and the Smart App Launch session.  I especially appreciated that the Smart App Launch session was extended to help clarify the scopes and patient selection flow.  The sessions discussing the CarinBB IG and showing examples were informative, I wish they were a bit longer and provided opportunity for more discussion.</p>\n<p>It seems like the client server testing during the connectathon was more focused on authentication between servers.  There were quite a few folks attending that were just trying to understand this piece, authenticating/handshaking/patient selection flow, so it was good for everyone to have a chance to learn and work this out during connectathon.  However, that did not leave a lot of time for discussion/feedback as to the data exchange itself.  </p>\n<p>I did get an opportunity to test our current implementation of the CarinBB using a couple of the aegis touchstone tests, they were helpful in pointing out issues we still have with supporting required EOB elements and coding system uri's.  </p>\n<p>The demo's provided a good overview of how different apps ingest and show the data.</p>\n<p>thanks again for hosting the connectathon.</p>",
