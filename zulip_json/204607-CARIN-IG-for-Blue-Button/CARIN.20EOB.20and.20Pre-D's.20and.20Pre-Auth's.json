These rules, where they address patient access, apply to adjudicated claims. So, I would say that your assumption is correct for use of the CARIN IG. <br>\nAlso since the EOB <code>use</code> has to be claim, I think it would be very confusing to the patient to have predeterminations and pre-authorizations show up as claims.</p>\n<p>I am sure <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"243554\">@Pat Taylor</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192132\">@Amol Vyas</span> , and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"238353\">@Mark Roberts</span> can provide more context and history if needed.</p>",
