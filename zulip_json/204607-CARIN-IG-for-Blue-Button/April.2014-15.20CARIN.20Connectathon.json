Connectathon attendees will have the opportunity for hands-on testing of the CARIN Consumer Directed Payer Data Exchange (CARIN IG for Blue Button®) Implementation Guide, learn more about the IG, and have the opportunity to ask the IG developers questions. We have received confirmation from many of the major payers in the U.S. that they will be participating. We are looking for additional clients and servers to participate. The event is free for all attendees to attend. We also anticipate testing other consumer-focused IGs from the HL7 patient workgroup. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"225094\">@Debi Willis</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191531\">@Virginia Lorenzi</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197491\">@Dave deBronkart</span> </p>\n<p>We will hold an Information Session in early April to help prepare participants for the Connectathon.
