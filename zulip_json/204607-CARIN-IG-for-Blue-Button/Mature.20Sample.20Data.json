Would you guys like to propose a day of the week that works best for you?  We can all get together and see how best to define what done would mean for this task and try to divy it up amongst the three of us.  I like the way you labled the stream.  For me there are two aspects of what the community needs.  In addition to (1) continuing to enhance the Synthea Open Source tool to generate data that aligns with the latest version of the IG  I think it would be valuable for us to explore if there is someway we can establish a real-world representative test data set that has defects that we can leverage as a mechanism to validate the various pipelines being developed by folks in the space.  </p>\n<p>Maybe more good then the world can bare in one shot but I am curious if others have similar thoughts.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192132\">@Amol Vyas</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"233860\">@Matthew Mosier</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"333516\">@Richard Braman</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192609\">@Mark Scrimshire</span></p>",
