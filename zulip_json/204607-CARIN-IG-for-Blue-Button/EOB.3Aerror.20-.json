Perhaps paramount though is an issue that has been identified with STU1.0.0 Professional and Non-Clinical EoB Profile. The issue was with ExplanationOfBenefit.item.adjuication slices. The C4BBPayerAdjudicationStatus code System was not added to the all slices discriminator of ExplanationOfBenefit.item.adjudication.category. <br>\nThis means it is not possible to include that slice, but since that slice is required, this means that it is not possible to create a valid Professional and Non-Clinician ExplanationOfBenefit with line level item elements. </p>\n<p>This issue is noted here: <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30806\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30806</a> and has been addressed in the upcoming STU1.1.0 that is currently sitting as the CI build going through the publication request process.</p>",
