We're currently hung up when trying to generate EOB.payee.party for just an Organization since the reference is to PractitionerRole which now requires Organization and Practitioner. Is it allowable to, in the case of an Organization, build Practitioner just as a display with the Organization name and build the reference to Organization?</p>",

We represent the Pharmacy as an organization under eob.provider. So we are also curious about Payee being Practitioner Role. According to the CPCDS Data mapping for Practitioner Role, the Organization is to be contained within that Practitioner Role. Yet, there should already be a primary resource available for this Organization. <br>\nFYI - <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"270256\">@Bapi Behera</span></p>",
