        "content": "<p>There are some pharmacy benefit designs that charge the member a penalty for product, network, or channel selection. The most easily explained scenario is a member-pay-the-difference penalty for choosing a Brand Drug when there is a Generic Available. We are looking to see where we would map this in the Pharmacy EOB item.adjudication:adjudicationamounttype.  The issue is which C4BB Adjudication Category Discriminator code to use.  There is a required binding to the values and there isn't  a code for penalty. The closest option we could see was \"noncovered.\"  However in the CPCDS mapping, it looks like noncovered has been earmarked for a specific NCPDP value <br>\n\"Line noncovered amount - Non-Covered Amount represents the NCPDP financial response field Amount Exceeding Periodic Benefit Maximum.\" Can we use Noncovered for multiple things on one claim - like a penalty + exceeding benefit max?  Or can there only be one 'noncovered' amount?  Thanks!</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"217847\">@Mona O</span></p>",
