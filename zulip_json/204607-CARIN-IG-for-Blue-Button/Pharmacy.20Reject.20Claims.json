Medical claims are typically submitted after the service is completed; pharmacy claims are submitted before the medication is dispensed.  As a result, if a claim is rejected in the medical world, it represents something that happened to the patient, but the insurer decided not to pay for.  On the other hand, if a pharmacy claim is rejected, it represents a dispensing event that did not occur.</p>",

And, to your point, the NCPDP reject code field, #511-FB is used when transactions cannot be completed.
