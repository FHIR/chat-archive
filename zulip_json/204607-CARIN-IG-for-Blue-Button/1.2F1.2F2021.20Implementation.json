After Tuesday, we believe we'll be down to two buckets of open ticket items: </p>\n<p>1) 49 tickets that relate to terminology which HTA and FM are working on resolving <br>\n2) 46 open tickets the CARIN IG for Blue ButtonÂ® team to resolve with the HL7 community </p>\n<p>FYI, we recently published an updated build here: <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/branches/master/index.html\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/branches/master/index.html</a> and anticipate another CI build by the end of July. You can view the latest status for each of our issues in HL7's JIRA. Anyone in the HL7 community can join our ballot reconciliation calls for the latest updates.

Moreover, app clients are not required to assert their compatibility to the server. It's very possible to have an app client implicitly assume latest, while the server is using a prior version (as correctly indicated in the server CapabilityStatement).</p>\n<p>For future reference, in interim release v0.1.3 (8 September 2020), the version convention is changed to: <code>Release.Ballot.Version</code><br>\nThis means that what Howells refered to as <code>v.0.3.1</code> precedes <code>v0.1.2</code> (because v0.1.2 uses the updated versioning convention).</p>",

We are trying to get to \"1\", but are currently pre-publication of 1.0, so we are v = 0<br>\nb = ballot number for this version.   CARIN IG for BB has been balloted once, so b = 1<br>\nr = revision number.   The IG team can use this as they wish.
