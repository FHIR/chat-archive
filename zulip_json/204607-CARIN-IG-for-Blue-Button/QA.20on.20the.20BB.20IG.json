Please add a publish box (see <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179165-committers\" title=\"#narrow/stream/179165-committers\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179165-committers</a> channel)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the spec presently includes both a FHIR icon, and an HL7 icon. The HL7 icon can only be used by HL7 or accelerator projects, and the FHIR icon can only be used by HL7, accelerator projects, or requires written permission, which has not been done in this case </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ryan hasn't signed up as an accelerator project (yet)... so you might ask him what his plans are, and if he's not going to do that quickly, it would be good to remove the icons until he does</p>",

As you might know, we're using the Trifolia-on-FHIR tool for IG authoring. While I did add explicit DRAFT verbiage on the version and home page, I must give credit to the tool for generating the status box. I am also investigating if there is a way to customize the text within the status box from the tool.</p>",
