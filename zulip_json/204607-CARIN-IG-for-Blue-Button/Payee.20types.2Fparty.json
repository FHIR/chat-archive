My understand is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The types are: subscriber, provider, other; with beneficiary to be added (pending approval - <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-27008\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-27008</a>). </li>\n<li>ExplanationOfBenefit.payee.party references C4BBOrganization, C4BBPatient, C4BBPractictioner. The details on ExplanationOfBenefit.payee.party says \"need to provide demographics if the payee is not 'subscriber' nor 'provider'.\" It has 1.1 cardinality so there must be a resource referenced for each Payee. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is how we are modeling it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If type is \"provider\" then use C4BBOrganization or C4BBPractictioner</li>\n<li>If type is \"beneficiary\" then use C4BBPatient</li>\n<li>If type is \"subscriber\" then use C4BBPatient</li>\n<li>If type is \"other\" then use ???. Can \"other\" be an organization or a person or both? If a person, is C4BBPatient the appropriate resource type? I saw that RelatedPerson was previously referenced by the CARIN IG but has since been dropped.</li>\n</ul>",
