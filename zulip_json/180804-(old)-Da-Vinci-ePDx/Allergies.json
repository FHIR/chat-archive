Could you share similar guidelines for medications, conditions and document reference resources so that they are visible as new entries every time.</p>",

For ePDx, we'll need to know which resources (medication, condition, allergyintolerance, Docref) each participant will support. I will then create a list of clinical data for ePDx for each resource and ask each participant to support several of them. That way, if you're writing a resource to Cerner during the course of the day, the information will  be coherent and not be duplicative.  For example, we'll have at least 8 different conditions that will be written to the EHR once each during the day.  </p>\n<p>We'll make this clearer in our HIMSS Vignette call next week.</p>",
