Looking at the hl7.fhir.core package summary, that version doesn't exist: <a href=\"http://packages.fhir.org/hl7.fhir.core\">http://packages.fhir.org/hl7.fhir.core</a></p>\n<p>In the other topic I'm asking about what HAPI should do, but in this topic could I make a request to have the broken dependency version fixed in the PDEX package? IMO PDEX should depend on 4.0.x and not on a specific point version.</p>",
