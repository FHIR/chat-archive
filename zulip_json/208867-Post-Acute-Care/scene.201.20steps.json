        "content": "<p>Chirag, Matt, </p>\n<p>Here is a revised sequence of events for Scene 1.  We have already cleared the eLTSS CC FHIR Server in preparation for the start of Scene1<br>\n1-15-2021 Scene 1 Testing Recording 10:30am EST<br>\n1.  Here is the sequence we envision for the Connectathon testing.  Please confirm this is also your understanding/expectation.  <br>\n2.  Scene 1, Patient receiving LTSS while at home: <br>\n3.  Altarum Clears Data from eLTSS CC FHIR Server<br>\n4.  FEI uploads eLTSS bundle to eLTSS CC FHIR Server.  FEI lets Altarum know the Bundle id (Bundle resource with contained eLTSS resources)<br>\n5.  Altarum scripts copying the eLTSS contained resources from the bundle, converting them to individual eLTSS FHIR resources, then loading them to the eLTSS CC FHIR Server.<br>\n6.  Altarum displays the Bundle resource on the eLTSS CC FHIR Server GUI. <br>\n7.  Altarum runs a $everything on the eLTSS CC FHIR Server GUI showing that the contained resources were extracted from the bundle and loaded as individual eLTSS FHIR resources and data for the FEI Patient: Betsy Smith Johnson (with unique patient ID: “client…19”), on the eLTSS CC FHIR server.  <br>\n8.  There will be no attempt to deliver the FEI eLTSS FHIR resources and data for patient ID: “client…19” to the PCS Health Data Manager (HDM).<br>\n9.  FEI - Done<br>\n10. Altarum Clears Data from eLTSS-CC Server<br>\n11. Altarum loads full Betsy Smith Johnson (Becky bundle) to eLTSS CC FHIR Server<br>\n12. Altarum will use their FHIR VUHR/Broker tool to broker the complete set of test data from the eLTSS CC FHIR Server to the PCS HDM FHIR Server.  (patientBSJ1)<br>\n13. Altarum will display the set of eLTSS resources that were transmitted to the PCS HDM via the FHIR VUHR/Broker tool. <br>\n14. PCS will also display the eLTSS FHIR resources and data for patient: Betsy Smith Johnson on the HDM using their client/tool.  <br>\n15. Altarum – Done. <br>\n16. MaxMD will upload an Advanced Directive (AD) to the eLTSS CC FHIR server (DocumentReference FHIR resource)<br>\n17. If necessary Altarum may show that the “DocumentReference” Resource was loaded to the eLTSS CC FHIR Server using the server GUI. (Requires a restart on the eLTSS CC FHIR Server – 5 minutes - to get the new counters in place in the GUI)<br>\n18. MaxMD will use their CDA Viewer application that will be pointed at the eLTSS CC FHIR Server DocumentReference resource to display the contents of the AD.<br>\n19. There will be no attempt to deliver the MaxMD AD to the PCS HDM. <br>\n20. MaxMD – Done.</p>",
