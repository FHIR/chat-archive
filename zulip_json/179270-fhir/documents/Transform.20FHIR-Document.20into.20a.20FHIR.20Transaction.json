I came across this comment today; what issues/benefits do you see in transforming a FHIR-doc into a FHIR transaction?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One thing struck me as something that I'd like to follow up on: the transformation of a FHIR document to a transaction. In our FHIR training courses we discuss the posting of FHIR docs to /Binary, to / etc., but not a mapping to a transaction.</p>\n<p>Presumably the added value of that would be the fact that a document may be a lot older (and thus contain older versions of data) than data already known to a recieving application. Transactions support conditional updates, so that would allow a way of dealing with this. What do you see as the major advantage of such an approach? This would be a client-side (or middleware on behalf of the client) transform, so it fits with a restful way of thinking.</p>\n<p>One could also argue that we need a server side $process-document operation which would take the data from the document, selects whatever is new and relevant, and imports it into a database.</p>",
