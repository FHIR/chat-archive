The first (and more common) step would just be a DocumentReference with multiple <code>content</code> repetitions - one for the original scanned image and one for the OCR'd text.  You might have a third that tags the data to make some of the statements computable.  Going beyond that to turn the tags into valid populated resources with discrete data is not something I've seen anyone do - and that would really be the only reason to go beyond DocumentReference.</p>",
