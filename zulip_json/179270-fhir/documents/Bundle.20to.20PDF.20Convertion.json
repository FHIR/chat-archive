If you're wanting to turn FHIR documents that are conformant with C-CDA on FHIR, that's probably possible.  Turning FHIR documents into a PDF should be straight-forward.  Turning arbitrary FHIR Bundles into a PDF is possible, but there's no standard for how to render arbitrary bundles, so you'd have to figure out how you wanted them to look.  I'm not aware of anything in Javascript that would do this right now.</p>",
