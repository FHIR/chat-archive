This turns out to be an error in the FHIR spec itself. The constrain in the spec is not formulated correctly. A GForge ticket was already filed by Michel, which has been approved and which will be addressed in R4 of FHIR.  </p>\n<p>This is something our validator may need to skip. At the moment, you can also get past this validation error by putting another constraint before the slicing.</p>",
