On composition the following is stated:</p>\n<p>\"A composition is a logical construct- its identifier matches to the CDA ClinicalDocument.setId. Composition resources are wrapped into Document structures, for exchange of the whole package (the composition and its parts), and this wrapped, sealed entity is equivalent to a CDA document, where <strong>the <a href=\"http://Bundle.id\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Bundle.id\">Bundle.id</a> is equivalent in function to <a href=\"http://ClinicalDocument.id\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ClinicalDocument.id\">ClinicalDocument.id</a> (but it is not identical when interconverting, since it's a transform between them).</strong>\"</p>\n<p>What does that in bold mean in case where a client needs to send off a FHIR Document to a server? Can FHIR documents that needs to map to CDA only be send as upserts as <a href=\"http://Bundle.id\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Bundle.id\">Bundle.id</a> maps to <a href=\"http://ClinicalDocument.id\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ClinicalDocument.id\">ClinicalDocument.id</a>, and hence a POST is not an option since the client is then not able to supply the <a href=\"http://ClinicalDocument.id\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ClinicalDocument.id\">ClinicalDocument.id</a>?</p>",
