The map itself is quite small (217 lines, <a href=\"https://github.com/ahdis/cda-core-2.0/blob/develop/maps/CDAMedicationCardDocument.map\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ahdis/cda-core-2.0/blob/develop/maps/CDAMedicationCardDocument.map\">https://github.com/ahdis/cda-core-2.0/blob/develop/maps/CDAMedicationCardDocument.map</a>) using the base CDA to FHIR mapping provided from the CCDA to FHIR project. I am currently working on the other medication documents (IHE Pharmacy MTP, PRE, DIS, PADV), so far I have not seen too  many challenges, however its far from beeing considered best practice.</p>",
