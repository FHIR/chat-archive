When we last looked, the consistency of XMI to represent diagrams was low and others who cared about UML representations were happy enough to drive from the schemas or the reference implementations.  Having XMI is really just waiting on having someone who wants it enough they're willing to write the converter from the StructureDefinitions and test the result with various tools.</p>",

We intend use the UML models and associated tooling for FHIR profile design, model transformation, mapping, and code generation.  As part of MDHT, we are developing a UML profile for FHIR.  Still work in progress, but coming along well.  Per Lloydâ€™s comment, we are focused on the model representation, not including diagrams.  Any UML 2.5 tool could be used to create the diagrams.<br>\n  See <a href=\"https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.mdht\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.mdht\">https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.mdht</a></p>",
