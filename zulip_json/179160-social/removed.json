And doing that (focusing on the money flow) is the root cause of so many dysfunctions that seem to mystify smart people.</p>\n<p>A second sign of the dysfunction is that from the POV of THE SICK PERSON - the person for whom the industry exists - too often they're the NOT-payers - the ones who refuse to \"pay\" for a claim or a treatment recommendation. Not surprisingly, these moments are literally non-events for people who are just watching the money flow.  So I hope people will just stop calling insurance companies payers.</p>\n<p>Ergo, I'll continue this under the title \"insurance as...\"</p>",

Part of this is that since they didn't provide those services, they didn't get paid for them either (storage and processing costs have to be eaten).  There are other (and more complex) reasons, such as barriers to connecting to 'n' arbitrary systems (if the patient can correctly remember them), accuracy of data, etc.  Overall, it's not an easy sell.</p>\n<p>An insurer, on the other hand, wants to have as much data about a person as possible.  More data = better actuary tables.  More data = preventative care that saves money and improves the health of the group.  More data is just more better  =).  This works out since the <em>current</em> set for USCDI isn't too costly to store, though I wonder what will happen as that changes (e.g., if USCDI starts to include imaging data, etc.).</p>\n<p>As an interested patient that travels quite a bit (during non-pandemic times), I would be happy to have an accessible long-term repository.  I would even pay a nominal annual cost for one... but I don't know if the 'average' American patient is motivated enough to do so.</p>",

To be clear, I don't object to an insurer being <em>a</em> repository, if you or I invite them.

As such the idea of an insurance company playing a role in storing healthcare data, or making it available to providers or patients is simply absurd. Vive la difference !</p>",
