SMART makes it possible, they say.</p>\n<p><em>Next topic: The Bulk Data API</em></p>\n<p>While a lot of health data transactions are for a single patient, a lot of other work (e.g. analyzing population health) requires telling an EHR to send <em>tons</em> of data - \"Give me all your XYZ data about men between ages 25 and 55,\" etc. This is a whole different API.</p>",
