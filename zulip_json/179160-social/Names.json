Putting them in the spec invites comments on where we made incorrect assumptions <span aria-label=\"grimacing\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f62c\" role=\"img\" title=\"grimacing\">:grimacing:</span>  I think the only place where we put equivalent \"best practice\" guidance is security, and not the dozens of other areas we could provide education. Adding them also exposes us to the risk that some of these, while amusing, might actually be wrong; or a list not being thorough enough and omitting something crucial.</p>",
