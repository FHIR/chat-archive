It includes lots that FHIR does/has e.g. open, free, metadata to be accessible etc. But to tick all the FAIR boxes would take a little bit of explanation. Wondering if that exercise has been done.</p>",

Actually, on the HL7 Netherlands WGM last year, we had a small hackathon about using a FHIR server as data station in a Personal Health Train research algorithm that was sent to multiple FAIR data stations. The source code for using a FHIR server as data station is at <a href=\"https://github.com/jvsoest/PHT_on_FHIR_demo\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jvsoest/PHT_on_FHIR_demo\">https://github.com/jvsoest/PHT_on_FHIR_demo</a></p>",
