A little late because I’ve already posted a couple of questions but better late than never.</p>\n<p>I’m a long-time health and health-standards developer in Australia. I’m working on a few projects that are likely to use FHIR as a platform. Have worked with Grahame, Brian, Michael L, Brett E etc on various standards-related projects in the past including the Australian MyHealthRecord (PCEHR) and our local secure message delivery specs. </p>\n<p>Mostly using Java and javascript. </p>\n<p>Ciao,</p>\n<p>Andrew</p>",
