I am a rising medical student at UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine and have a few questions about the future of Electronic Health Records systems and interoperability. I am not sure if this is the place to ask but I was sent here by HL7 HQ. I have a very basic understanding of FHIR. </p>\n<p>Will healthcare facilities be able to pull data from another facility simply with the resource id? Can a medical record number be used instead?</p>\n<p>To be fully interoperable, does an API have to allow access to delete/update a fhir resource? To me, this sounds dangerous. Unless fhir resources are going to be stored an a separate database from the main database.</p>\n<p>Will healthcare facilities have to register with one another for access, say through an API Key, to each facility's API?</p>\n<p>Please excuse my lack of knowledge on this topic. I hope that I can better understand FHIR/interoperability since I spent my gap year before medical school working in two clinics where I faced current limitations in information exchange.</p>",

That's not just to establish trust relationships, but also to establish mechanisms for validating user identity, rules around handling sensitive data, etc.  The specific rules will vary by environment - how healthcare systems are managed and regulated varies significantly from country to country and those sorts of policies aren't ones that HL7 can enforce.
