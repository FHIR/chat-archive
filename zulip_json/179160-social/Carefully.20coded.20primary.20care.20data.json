It would be difficult to do this research without carefully coded primary care data. For example, ethnicity is well recorded by many GP practices, and this was vital to help us understand the impact of COVID-19 on BAME communities.”</p>\n<p>&amp; especially: </p>\n<p>\"It would be difficult to do this research without carefully coded primary care data\"</p>\n<p>Other examples of things that can then be looked at:<br>\n\"The data is enabling the researchers to understand the spread of COVID-19, including tracking when it peaks and helping to inform strategy on local social distancing and lockdown. It is also being used to evaluate rapid COVID-19 finger prick tests against swab tests. Some practices are taking part in rapid clinical trials of antibiotics to reduce the duration and severity of the virus.\"</p>",
