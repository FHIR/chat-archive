Embracing a philosphy to enable fruit to grow anywhere around the world will require some major changes to HL7 international and its affiliates.  <br>\nSeems like a good topic for the #social stream.. lots of opinions, I'm sure.</p>",

I'd certainly like to see International Council and Affiliate Members in general play a major role in implementing the 'Global Relevance' theme. While I realise that this is re-litigating issues fully debated in the past, there have been some major changes since the last major IC proposal for re-structuring the organisation was rejected; namely - free IP, FHIR and COVID-19.</p>",

If not we're forcing HL7 'international'  to again be mostly focused on the US. But it would certainly be helpful if e.g. 50% of this taskforce were not to be based in the US, given that (if  we look at HL7 membership numbers accross all HL7 organizations) more than 50% of the membership isn't actually based in the US.  </p>\n<p>Just for fun: remember this spoof <a href=\"http://www.ihmsdo.org/\">http://www.ihmsdo.org/</a> from years ago?</p>",
