We're developing a digital front door for our customers to access their appointments, obtain virtual care, see &amp; request prescription refills,  pull data from wearables and so on. This app will push and pull data from our EHR and package this in one nicely branded, easy-to-use application on a smart phone or device.  The second phase of our digital evolution is to build a population health management tool that will pull data from our EHR and all other outside sources of healthcare providers ie: labs, hospitals and health systems (so EPIC, Cerner...), TPA's for claims data and so on for a full 360 degree view of all healthcare consumed and scheduled for any one of our patients.  I don't know what I don't know about APIs, FHIR, Hl7. Where should someone like me start to get educated on healthcare software development and FHIR standards?</p>",
