My personal observation is that HL7 is still finding its \"Confluence legs\".  There's certainly more that we can do to improve navigation.  We haven't migrated most of the FHIR content over to Confluence yet in part because we haven't figured out how best to make it navigable (and because we don't want to reproduce the mess we have on the old MediaWiki site).  Certainly concrete suggestions on how to improve navigability are welcome.  General statements of \"it's hard to find stuff\" will be met with agreement, but don't necessarily point the way forward.</p>",
