I can see that it's targeted at Accelerator people, which I'd define as \"Motivated people who are new to HL's byzantine ways\".  Guess what: our Patient Engagement WG has a bunch of people who fit that definition too. <span aria-label=\"slight smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"slight smile\">:slight_smile:</span> </p>\n<p>Maybe call it Newcomer Home, or Welcome Newcomer, or HL7 Newcomer Orientation?  Or \"Feel lost? Want some maps?\" :-) </p>\n<p>HT <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"225094\">@Debi Willis</span> for finding this!   I imagine <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> and others will be happy that we may need less WG time for such things.</p>",

If the community would like this changed to a more inclusive name, I'm happy to do so. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191759\">@Melva Peters</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"295811\">@Ken McCaslin</span> have done most of the work here so perhaps they would be helpful on input as to how its name could be changed? </p>\n<p>Now as far as getting the word out, with name as is or not, that's a great idea. I will discuss with Melva on how we may roll this out so that workgroups have more visibility!</p>",

We have been promoting it as a place to go to get information.  I'm glad you found it and find it useful.</p>",
