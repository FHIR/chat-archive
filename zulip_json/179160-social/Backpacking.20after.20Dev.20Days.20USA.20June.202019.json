There is very little elevation gain for the first 10 miles where we would make camp at Lewis Meadow, so even novice backpackers will be fine the first day. On the 2nd day people who are feeling more adventurous can day hike up to Elk Lake or Glacier Meadows. There will be about 4000 feet of elevation gain, but supposedly fantastic views. However, there will likely be  snow the last couple miles, so micro spikes and an axe ice (for self arrest) are recommended by the ranger I spoke to.  If anyone doesn’t want to make that strenuous of a hike they can explore the Lewis Meadow area.</p>\n<p>Another good option will be the Enchanted Valley. This would be better if the group contains mostly novice backpackers:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/east-fork-quinault-river-trail.htm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/east-fork-quinault-river-trail.htm\">https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/east-fork-quinault-river-trail.htm</a></p>\n<p>I did this as part of a 5-day through hike back in 2012 and it was very good,  though the truly spectacular stuff (like the Anderson Glacier) will be a bit to far for a 2-night trip.  For a 2 day hike in/out there will be very little elevation gain, but some wonderful views of the snow covered mountains enclosing the valley. </p>\n<p>So, I'd like to get a final count of who will be going, as I will need to get back country passes in advance, and what your preference would be (Hoh River or Enchanged Valley), and whether you are new to backpacking or relatively experienced. </p>\n<p>Here are the people that have expressed interest so far. </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191328\">@Ewout Kramer</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"193551\">@Marco Visser</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191678\">@Abigail Watson</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192301\">@Ardon Toonstra</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191450\">@Simone Heckmann</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191334\">@Marten Smits</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"203235\">@Ward Weistra</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191757\">@Christiaan Knaap</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191405\">@Rob Hausam</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"193260\">@Zabrina Gonzaga</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191376\">@Jim Steel</span></p>",

If bear canisters aren't required and bear wires aren't available, an Ursack could be an option (available from <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/b/ursack/c/bear-safety\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.rei.com/b/ursack/c/bear-safety\">REI</a>, although a bit pricey).
