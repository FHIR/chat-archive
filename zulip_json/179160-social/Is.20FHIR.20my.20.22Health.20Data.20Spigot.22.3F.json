The big change is not that FHIR exists, but that the FHIR community has done more than just create a standard. They have created open-source reference implementations, applications, toolkits (HAPI), sandboxes, test tools, hackathons,  and excitement. It is this community that has done more than purely FHIR existing.</p>",
