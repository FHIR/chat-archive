We're trying to poll for updated encounters while including the relevant patient object in the response.</p>\n<p>Our URL looks something like this:  <a href=\"http://baseUrl/Encounter?_lastUpdated=gt2021-10-26T09:00&amp;_include=Encounter:subject&amp;_include=Encounter:location\">http://baseUrl/Encounter?_lastUpdated=gt2021-10-26T09:00&amp;_include=Encounter:subject&amp;_include=Encounter:location</a></p>\n<p>When testing this against one of the public R4 test servers,  we're able to get the referenced patient via 'encounter.getSubject().getResource()', which is the standard as far as I can tell. </p>\n<p>However, when performing the same requests against one of our company's own test servers, we're always receiving a null value. We've compared the returned JSONs multiple times, but as far as we can tell there's not really anything wrong/different between the two.</p>\n<p>Has anyone else encountered similar problems before?</p>\n<p>Kind regards</p>\n<p>Brian</p>",
