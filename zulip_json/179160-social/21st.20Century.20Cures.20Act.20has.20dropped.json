Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)<br>\nWe have adopted a new API certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(10) to replace the “application access—data category request” certification criterion (§ 170.315(g)(8)), and added it to the updated 2015 Edition Base EHR definition. This new “standardized API for patient and population services” certification criterion focuses on supporting two types of API-enabled services: (1) services for which a single patient's data is the focus and (2) services for which multiple patients' data are the focus. The API certification criterion requires the use of the Health Level 7 (HL7®) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) standard Release 4 and references several standards and implementation specifications adopted in § 170.213 and § 170.215 to support standardization and interoperability. This certification criterion will align industry efforts around FHIR Release 4 and advance interoperability of API-enabled “read” services for single and multiple patients.\"</p>",

That said, if R4 is required as a minimum, that wouldn't prevent systems from <em>also</em> supporting more recent versions.

What is \"allow adoption\"?  </p>\n<p>I'm sure I have the terms wrong, but I'll guess there's such a thing as a FHIR Request Sender and a FHIR Request Receiver, roughly also known as FHIR Data Wanter and FHIR Data Haver.   And I'll guess that FHIR  4.0.1 provides a certain level of clever and granularity and later versions are probably a superset (though some 4.0.1 might get deprecated in later versions). </p>\n<p>So good so far?  Please correct. </p>\n<p>Now, if I'm a slicker shinier newer Data Haver, so I can Receive Requests at a higher level, I'd say I've adopted something higher.  Are you asking if I'm ALLOWED to do that?   (Why wouldn't I be?)</p>\n<p>Or maybe more exotic: Let's say I'm Mankind's Greatest Hospital and I have super-awesome biz partners and we BOTH can talk FHIR beyond 4.0.1.
