Former requires people skills, estimating skills, prioritization, ability to think about the complete set of stages (requirements, development, testing, acceptance, marketing, etc.  Most/all of those are FHIR-independent skills.  Developer will need deep knowledge of the tech stack you're planning to use, understand the difference between what you do internally vs. what needs to appear on the FHIR interface.  Should certainly understand REST interfaces and knowledge of FHIR specifically would be helpful.  Also needs to be someone who's willing to reach out to the community (i.e. here) when they have questions.</p>",
