Patients will be able to use applications they authorize to receive data from their medical records. OAuth 2 is used to authorize applications – the same highly secure protocol used on travel and banking apps.</p>\n<p><strong>Promoting the Ability to Shop for Care and Manage Costs</strong><br>\nONC's Cures Act Final Rule looks to expand patient and payer choice in health care by increasing the availability of data that can support insights about care quality and costs. Much in the way apps have helped transparency in many industries such as online shopping, travel, and banking, they will be used to deliver information to patients and payers to assist in making decisions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Seems to me we'd need to know a lot more specifics than that, but maybe I'm wrong... <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191387\">@Keith Boone</span>  what's your perspective?</p>",

I've been plowing through the PDF for a while, and oy, there is NO way for a layperson to tell where that starts. :-)  I'm going to guess it's at the bottom of page 1145 (exactly the last 100 pages), where it says this:<br>\n**PART 170 – HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS, IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATIONS, AND CERTIFICATION CRITERIA AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS FOR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY<br>\n**<br>\nAnd yeah, as Josh says, it's indeed just a pile of edits / diffs / changes to previous rules.
