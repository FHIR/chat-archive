I'd like to share congratulations with all involved as I have a great respect for both companies.  My best friend Amitai Schlair (<a href=\"http://agilein3minut.es/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://agilein3minut.es/\">http://agilein3minut.es/</a>) worked at Pillar for a few years.  I have a few acquaintances there and even interviewed there myself (The bar is high!).  Along with Duo Security, Pillar Technology has led the way for Agile Software Development and innovation where I live in Ann Arbor.  I know this probably sounds commercial-y, but I truly believe that Pillar does so many things right that I look forward to seeing the results of the Accenture purchase. Congrats to all involved!</p>",
