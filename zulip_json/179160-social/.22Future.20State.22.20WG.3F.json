HL7's scope includes chickens on a farm, rats in a research library, ebola treatment in the Congo, social services in Kyoto and cardiac research in Boston.  In the end, we can't move faster than the community of implementers who are wanting to build things \"now\".  Doing some forecasting to identify issues we might need to address in our specs could theoretically be useful, but as a standards development organization, all we can really do is facilitate behaviors that implementers are interested in and scope those to be designed to evolve in ways we think might be helpful.</p>",
