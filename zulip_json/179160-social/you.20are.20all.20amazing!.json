Coming back to informatics (now I have a bank of study leave the hospital owes me) after a solid 15 year break is really interesting. The thing that is obvious is the many 1000s of hours that people have put in to advance the conceptual frameworks and mapping them to modern technology. So even though I've been poking at some of the soft spots just wanted to say that FHIR is amazing! </p>",
