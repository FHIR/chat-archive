As part of this it pushes a summary clinical record and can check when the consultation is complete, including pulling a summary of the encounter. There were three different clinical systems in use in the area so we wanted a common data model; our preferred architecture was web app+REST API. Our choices were to define our own model+API or to try FHIR ... we chose the path of least resistance (FHIR) and haven't looked back since  ;)</p>",
