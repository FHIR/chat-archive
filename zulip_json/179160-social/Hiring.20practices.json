That said, I'm part of the 'typical demographic', so I might not be aware of unwelcoming cues we're giving off unintentionally that may be barriers to some participants.</p>\n<p>For #1, I'm not sure what to do - but we'd certainly welcome ideas/suggestions</p>",

Here's an example for an event: <a href=\"https://confcodeofconduct.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://confcodeofconduct.com\">https://confcodeofconduct.com</a> , and here's a guide for projects:  <a href=\"https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct\">https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct</a></p>",

However the notion of starting meetings (conference calls, connectathons, DevDays, etc.) by pointing people to it and saying \"if you choose to stay and participate, you're agreeing to abide by it\" is certainly something we can do.  And putting it in a blurb alongside our reference to the FHIR license as part of our various Git projects is something that would be doable too.   <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191782\">@Brian Kaney</span> Thanks for the suggestion.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> Do you see any issues with us actioning this?</p>",
