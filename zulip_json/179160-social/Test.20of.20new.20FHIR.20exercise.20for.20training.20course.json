I'm looking for 8 or more volunteers with basic/intermediate level of knowledge about FHIR in order to do a test run of the exercise, Friday 29th, 17:00 CEST (Amsterdam), 11:00 ET (New York). <br>\nThe exercise itself will take around 20 minutes, with a bit of a lead-in related to the tool used. We'll be using Zoom as the context for the exercise, the exercise itself will be based on another web-based tool (zero download).</p>\n<p>Are you interested? Please sent me a 'Private Message' - thanks.</p>",
