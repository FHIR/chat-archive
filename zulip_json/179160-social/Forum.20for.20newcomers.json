The default place for newcomers is the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179166\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers\">#implementers</a> stream because it's fair game to ask absolutely anything there - though it contains everything from newbie to deep technical questions.  One of the challenges is that everyone is 'new' to some aspect of FHIR.  You might find the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179171\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179171-dotnet\">#dotnet</a> and <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179317\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179317-VHDir---Validated-Healthcare-Directory\">#VHDir - Validated Healthcare Directory</a> relevant.  Suggestions on how we can create a more welcoming environment for newcomers are certainly welcome.  (BTW - I changed the topic heading to one appropriate to the discussion.)</p>",
