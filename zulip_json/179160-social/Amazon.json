The company’s healthcare bankers – who drive $682 million in annual revenue – reassured their customers that the partnership won’t really be as disruptive as people are wildly speculating, but instead will be more like a group purchasing organization that will help the companies negotiate better prices for services their employees consume. Insiders say that more-disruptive activities that were discussed, especially with Amazon’s involvement — such as offering health insurance, starting a pharmacy benefits management company, and distributing drugs – are now off the table.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://histalk2.com/2018/02/06/news-2-7-18/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://histalk2.com/2018/02/06/news-2-7-18/\">http://histalk2.com/2018/02/06/news-2-7-18/</a></p>",
