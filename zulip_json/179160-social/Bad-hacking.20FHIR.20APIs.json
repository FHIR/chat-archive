I'm no security guru, but holy crap, hard-coding security keys?? And things like that.  And a vulnerability where a hacker can just replay a FaceID session to reactivate the authentication and play around?  Etc etc.  </p>\n<p>Or am I falling prey to a bogus press release? I know the project was funded by Approov, who makes a product that claims to remove the vulnerability; that's a separate question from: are these vulnerabilities truly there?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/cybersecurity/30-popular-mobile-health-apps-vulnerable-to-cyberattacks-phi-exposure.html\">https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/cybersecurity/30-popular-mobile-health-apps-vulnerable-to-cyberattacks-phi-exposure.html</a></p>",
