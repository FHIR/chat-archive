My organization's need is to describe stem cells (from peripheral blood, bone marrow, or cord blood) to be transplanted from a donor to a recipient. But we recognize it can also be used for blood transfusions, solid organ transplant, etc. So point your contact to OO and the proposal found at <a href=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=BiologicallyDerivedProduct_FHIR_Resource_Proposal\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=BiologicallyDerivedProduct_FHIR_Resource_Proposal\">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=BiologicallyDerivedProduct_FHIR_Resource_Proposal</a>.

For a couple of years, I was the only one from our organization going to HL7 meetings. Now we're going to FHIR DevDays in Nov for the first time and we've registered 7 people to go. So my recommendation is to help potential 'evangelists' with a tool kits of presentations that can be reused and tailored for different organizations. What I've been doing is giving a 10 minute background on what HL7 is, another 30 minutes on FHIR, and then show use cases and examples of how it can be used in our organization, along with xml/json code snippets with locally relevant data. A lot of material about HL7 and FHIR is stuff  I've reused from material I've found online that is shareable through Creative Commons license, with attribution.</p>",
