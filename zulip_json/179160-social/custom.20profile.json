Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any generic user friendly FHIR resource editor, so you have to create the example manually (e.g. via text/xml editor). Next, you can add a profile claim tag to your example Patient resource, referring to the canonical url of your patient profile. For example:<br>\n<a href=\"https://simplifier.net/NictizSTU3/Patient-example\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://simplifier.net/NictizSTU3/Patient-example\">https://simplifier.net/NictizSTU3/Patient-example</a><br>\nAssuming your FHIR server supports profile validation, if you now upload the Patient example to your server, then the server will verify the profile claim and report any validation errors (via OperationOutcome).</p>",
