(WSJ has a lot of surprisingly good coverage of health issues.)  </p>\n<p>Vince is a good guy but by the nature of his work he's usually aligned with the interests of executives, not the public.  </p>\n<p>I wrote a comment in response to the post that points out how a large part of the problem is the lack of interop, which causes the #1 problem docs reported - the need for care coordination, which is impeded by lack of portability.  I cited FHIR as a game-changer on patient power. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://e-caremanagement.com/wsj-article-md-referrals-leakage/#comment-2445\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://e-caremanagement.com/wsj-article-md-referrals-leakage/#comment-2445\">http://e-caremanagement.com/wsj-article-md-referrals-leakage/#comment-2445</a></p>",
