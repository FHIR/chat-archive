I've just subscribed to the chat and also the DICOM list-serve, and it struck me as archaic that only the messages posted over the last 30 days are available in the archives of the list-serve, and there is no \"search\" feature to explore the contents of the archives. Is there a good reason why not all archives can be made available to subscribers, and why they cannot be searched as most of the list-serve contents maintained in other sources?</p>",

I think I tried, but was confused, since my login didn't work, and there was no link to reset password. After reading the manual, I realized that option shows up after unsuccessful attempt to login. The interface is quite unusual, so it didn't register quickly in my mind what I should click. But I am able to log in now. Thanks for the help.</p>",
