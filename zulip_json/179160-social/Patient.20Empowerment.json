When apps don't work, inevitably patients will end up calling the helplines at healthcare organizations (who can't realistically be on the hook to support hundreds of apps they don't have any knowledge of).  What is the end user support model that those organizations should adopt?  Health care orgs are also rightly concerned that bad actors may create malicious apps and \"phish\" health data from patients - how can we prevent or mitigate those?  And what happens when well-intentioned apps give bad advice that could harm patients?  These sorts of questions I think are some of the major issues that need to be addressed before broadly adopted, \"seamless\" patient-centered data access can really flourish.

I can’t speak any more specifically to CommonWell than that, but can elaborate a bit for Carequality.  Today, Patient Request is one of the “permitted purposes” supported for query-based document exchange.  Carequality is working actively on enhancing its policies to enable wider support for exchange under this permitted purpose.  As we develop the policies and supporting technical components to enable FHIR-based exchange via Carequality, we fully expect that patient access use cases will be a critical part of the solution.

As CommonWell Adopters join the Alliance and are able to connect to Alliance services, we hope to see that volume go up.
