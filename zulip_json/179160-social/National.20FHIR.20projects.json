FHIR is grown in recent time and it is apparently the ONC Standard these days and is included in the 21^st Century Cures Act. So I was just curious, do we need to migrate to FHIR for my project where we currently using hl7 v2 for communication between the clinic and my organization.</p>\n<p>I currently see no issues in using HL7 v2, i would like to know whether moving to FHIR has any better advantage over HL7 V2.  Is FHIR is now public following standard or it still in development stage in the market.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",

However none of these advantages are enough for the market to start ripping and replacing v2 interfaces with FHIR, except in a few corner cases. If you tried to replace it right now, you'd most likely find that your partners were not ready for it, and don't even have any plans to be ready soon</p>",
