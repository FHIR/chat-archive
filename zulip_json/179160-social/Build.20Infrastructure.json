Circle CI also does open source, I think they give 4 containers for free.  If you use this you won't need to maintain your own server and you can get pretty detailed in the setup.  It has built in support for docker containers and workflows as well.  I've used it quite a bit, so if you need help setting it up, let me know.</p>",
