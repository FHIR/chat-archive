The paper seeks public consultation and suggestions on how best to implement the UHI.    Digital health in India is a clean slate, not much legacy . It's a chance to propose a truly open &amp; interoperable approach.  </p>\n<p>I am reaching out to you to seek your help &amp; guidance on what FHIR paradigm would be a good fit to develop UHI.  Also other recommendations based on your judgement.  </p>\n<p>Last date to submit the proposal is 23rd August 2021. </p>\n<p>Following is an excerpt from the UHI document accessible here <a href=\"https://ndhm.gov.in/publication/consultationpapers\">https://ndhm.gov.in/publication/consultationpapers</a>  . Chapter 5 explains the components of proposed UHI.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/Xeweo4gM8-CaTJxOEOnr9bPi/image.png\">image.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/Xeweo4gM8-CaTJxOEOnr9bPi/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/Xeweo4gM8-CaTJxOEOnr9bPi/image.png\"></a></div><p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/_qzf_JduGO8JI3uQvqWylKYn/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/_qzf_JduGO8JI3uQvqWylKYn/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/_qzf_JduGO8JI3uQvqWylKYn/image.png\"></a></div><p>UHI Service Components :</p>\n<p>1) UHI has a service discovery component which enables something like below <br>\nDiscover a doctor for teleconsultation: The user can search for, say, an eye specialist in retinal diseases near me  who speaks Hindi and is available tomorrow. The UHI gateway sends this request to all HSPs registered for teleconsultation service. Interested HSPs respond with the details of their doctor, consultation fee expected, payment methods and doctor availability to the UHI gateway.<br>\n2) Service booking <br>\n3) Service fulfillment <br>\n4) Financial settlement <br>\n5) post fulfilment.</p>\n<p>Example of services that can be enabled through UHI.<br>\n● Booking OPD appointments at hospitals / clinics <br>\n● Booking Tele-Consultation <br>\n● Discovering availability of critical care beds <br>\n● Discovery of lab and diagnostic services <br>\n● Booking of home visits for lab sample collections <br>\n● Booking an ambulance <br>\n● Discovery of nearby pharmacie . </p>\n<p>Looking forward to your comments.</p>",
