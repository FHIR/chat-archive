We are attempting to generate a PDF based on patient-generated health data collected within the first of many VA mobile applications we are refactoring to utilize the HAPI FHIR API and a FHIR-compliant MongoDB database model. One of the goals of our work is to deprecate existing shared services, in this case the document generator, and attempt to utilize the full capabilities of HAPI FHIR API. The existing shared services for PDG generation is coupled to other shared services that rely on other MongoDBs and not the PGHD MongoDB we are working to refactor to. Our challenge is to determine if another way we could generate PDFs based on the data we are storing in the FHIR MongoDB. Any ideas you or anyone else on this stream have about this would be helpful.</p>",

That is when a DocumentReference points at something like a CDA document, the client could use the negotiation to ask for a FHIR conversion. If the server supports this, then it can be returned in FHIR form. We just warned the client that the retrieval can only be expected in the form (mime-type) found in the DocumentReference. IHE is further leveraging this in a profile this year.</p>",
