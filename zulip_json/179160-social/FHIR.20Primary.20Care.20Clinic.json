Our interpretation is it covers PCP and CareManager (organization mostly) and not PCC as shown below:</p>\n<p>Patient.generalPractitioner: This may be the primary care provider (in a GP context), or it may be a patient nominated care manager in a community/disability setting, or even organization that will provide people to perform the care provider roles. It is not to be used to record Care Teams, these should be in a CareTeam resource that may be linked to the CarePlan or EpisodeOfCare resources. Multiple GPs may be recorded against the patient for various reasons, such as a student that has his home GP listed along with the GP at university during the school semesters, or a \"fly-in/fly-out\" worker that has the onsite GP also included with his home GP to remain aware of medical issues.</p>",
