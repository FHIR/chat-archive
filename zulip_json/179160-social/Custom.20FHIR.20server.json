Is it possible? Could you please suggest me</p>",

In limited cases, it's ok to make optional elements prohibited, though in general that's bad practice. (If you can ignore an element, it's better to let the instance in and throw certain elements away than it is to reject the instance and force communication partners to customize their interfaces to strip things away.)</p>\n<p>Have you read the section profiling?
