Does anyone know who to reach out to for more information?</li>\n<li>From the few words in the announcement it seems like a joint data model between FHIR and OMOP will be developed. Anyone details on the approach?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over the years there have been MANY mappings between the two models, but, as indicated by the new ones being developed, they have reusable to a very limited extend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All the ones listed here: <a href=\"https://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=projects:workgroups:mappings_between_ohdsi_cdm_and_fhir\">https://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=projects:workgroups:mappings_between_ohdsi_cdm_and_fhir</a>, including:<ul>\n<li>Georgia Tech's <a href=\"http://omoponfhir.org/\">http://omoponfhir.org/</a></li>\n<li>CDMH project: <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cdmh/profiles.html#omop-to-fhir-mappings\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cdmh/profiles.html#omop-to-fhir-mappings</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>MIRACUM: <a href=\"https://www.devdays.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sohrab-Hejazi-Map-FHIR-to-OMOP-_-DevDays-2019-Amsterdam.pdf\">https://www.devdays.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sohrab-Hejazi-Map-FHIR-to-OMOP-_-DevDays-2019-Amsterdam.pdf</a></li>\n<li>Google: <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare-data-harmonization/tree/master/mapping_configs/fhir_omop\">https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare-data-harmonization/tree/master/mapping_configs/fhir_omop</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think one of core problems is that when mapping between two specific data models you lose some information. Depending on mapping OMOP to what FHIR profiles (core resources with or without custom extensions, US core, anything else) you need to choose how to handle that. So, any mapping implementation from OMOP to one particular set of FHIR resources will not easily be reusable by another.<br>\nWouldn't it be more efficient in the long run if we'd model the OMOP data model in FHIR logical models and create one custom set of scripts that transforms the data between those.<br>\nThen every next project would only need to map between FHIR logical model conformant data to their profiles of choice, for example with the Mapping Language.</p>",

For example, I arranged for Christian Reich (OHDSI) to present on the OMOP CDM Genomics extensions to the Clinical Genomics Working Group last month. And in OMOP Oncology Vocabulary, I recommended they reach out to HL7 on how best to manage tooling and other modeling dependencies on the CDM when there is a version update. Perhaps we can build some synergy off of some of these discussions?</p>",
