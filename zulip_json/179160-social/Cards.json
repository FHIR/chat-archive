It's super simple.  Has some built-in games like Go Fish, Checkers &amp; Crazy Eights, but you can also play an arbitrary game that makes use of card decks.  (No chips though unless you use checkers...)  <a href=\"http://playingcards.io/\" title=\"http://playingcards.io/\">http://playingcards.io/</a></p>",
