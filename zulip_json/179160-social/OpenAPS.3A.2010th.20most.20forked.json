        "content": "<p>Many observations can be made, I guess.</p>\n<p>First, it seems to be a spectacular specimen of patient engagement: \"Give us a chance, and you might be AMAZED what we might do.\"  Note, this is engagement in the sense of patients being actively involved in their care - not engagement in the sense of \"following the doc's instructions\" or \"buying their pills as instructed, eating them, and buying more.\"</p>\n<p>Second, it's worth noting that when it's life-and-death, patients are infinitely more motivated, intrinsically, than any vendor. (Remember that the initiating hashtag was #WeAreNotWaiting, after decades of industry not producing.</p>\n<p>Third, the above make me reflect on the legal responsibility aspects. If I want to sell a product to people with an illness, I need to be damned sure it won't kill anyone, which can be really hard to be certain about.  But when the patients themselves do it, NOT to sell but for self-care, there's no commercial transaction - it's just self-help, shared freely. </p>\n<p>This is the point in Eric von Hippel's work at Sloan School about \"Free Innovation\" in any industry, including his article this year <a href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/when-patients-become-innovators/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/when-patients-become-innovators/\">When Patients Become Innovators</a>.  Dana is of course the lead specimen. Another is Sean Ahrens, Crohn's Disease patient who has created the Crohnology community. And they touch on patient-driven clinical trials.</p>",
