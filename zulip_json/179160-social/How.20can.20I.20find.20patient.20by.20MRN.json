I want to search patients by their MRN. <br>\nAs I understand identifier is MRN if it has type system \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0203\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0203\">http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0203</a>\" and code \"MR\".<br>\nBut how can I find a patient by them?</p>",

At the moment, there's no standard search criteria that lets you search by identifier type + value, only system + value.  You could define your own composite search criteria.  You could also submit a change request for us to define a standard mechanism.</p>",
