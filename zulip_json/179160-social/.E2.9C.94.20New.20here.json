Your are right that <code>Encounter.type</code> has a binding to the value set you mention. However, the binding only has the strength \"example\".  That means that there is no requirement (or even expectation) that instances will use codes from this set - it is merely way of indicating what kind of codes might be used in this element. To enforce the use of certain codes in an element, one needs a required or extensible binding - see the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/terminologies.html#strength\">documentation of binding strengths</a>.</p>",
