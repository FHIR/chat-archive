I know it's an extreme simplification, but to me as someone with only the thinnest technical knowledge, this seems valid, given what people here said at the start of the \"trivial tutorial\" thread.  Is this at all valid, as far as it goes?</p>\n<p>\"One way to think about FHIR is that every piece of data in the EMR has its own web address.\"</p>\n<p>IOW, since data is requested using what is basically (or literally?) a URL, is that analogy reasonably useful?</p>\n<p>I'm asking because part of the patient empowerment group's work will be to begin raising public awareness, and the public very much doesn't need deeply precise answers, they need directionally reasonable ways of understanding what's going on.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"9TsYJq3rBV8\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TsYJq3rBV8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=10229\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TsYJq3rBV8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=10229\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9TsYJq3rBV8/default.jpg\"></a></div>",
