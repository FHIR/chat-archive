That being said, I think it's true that most of our rules about how APIs operate are using data that is fixed in time and being exchanged. ADs are different, in that the person's AD may change over time and you always want the most up-to-date version. In this case, it seems logical to me that the API would provide pointers to the storage point--the current source of truth--rather than the actual data. That doesn't stop a consumer from choosing to use system A vs system B as their storage point...</p>",

But, if I am able to create an AD and have it in my consumer app and share it with EHR 1(my primary doc) in a structured way...and EHR 1 is able to absorb it and share it with EHR 2 (the hospital in another state) then they both have my AD. And if i have a copy of it in my consumer app, my care advocate that is linked to my app could have it on hand without trying to figure out what my password is for system A. </p>\n<p>It sounds like Lisa is able to absorb the data and create a CCD which can be stored in a consumer app and shared with any provider, and that provider can share it with another provider (via CCD). </p>\n<p>There has been a lot of discussion about the importance of a patient having a copy of their own data. If we built a system where a patient shared a pointer to a single system for providers to view the patient's most current medication list, there would be obvious concerns raised about that method. Having data stored somewhere and only sharing a pointer to it (and requiring a login) can cause severe road blocks that will impact patients who are in an emergency situation. I am happy to hear the plan is to share the actual data and not just a pointer to the data in a locked system that needs a password. Don't get me wrong. I think having systems that can store a patient's AD is good, i just don't think it makes sense to build interoperability standards that only share pointers. But, Lisa answered the question that was asked last week: \"Are you sharing a pointer or are you sharing the data?\" I believe i heard \"We are sharing a pointer\" last week, but it sounds like I misunderstood. Happy to see the data flow! That is so important to patients.</p>",

But my AD might be quite different from time to time. I may have put in a DNR order last year when my health was in great jeopardy, but this year, when I am healthier, I want to recind my DNR order. Having a pointer to the CURRENT AD really matters and old copies floating around could result in a very different--and lethal--outcome. Other data it makes sense to trend and it's ok to have multiple copies because trending my lab results from 1/6/21 with similar lab results from the past provides useful trending information.

        "content": "<p>Thanks Dave. </p>\n<p>A timely example of an \"interoperability\" problem - lab and vaccine reporting. Labs struggled to report to public health agencies. Now we're seeing similar with vaccination administration. Cue the \"healthcare has interoperability problems\" chorus. But it's not a semantic interoperability problem - CDC did great work to prescriptively guide states to use HL7v2.5.1 ORU/VXU/QBP/RSP. So if it's not semantic interoperability, what is it?</p>\n<p>It's a function of failed trust. Labs can't/don't report because it's too hard to \"onboard\" onto each state's inter org trust policies. The greatest promise of FHIR here (and in general) isn't the semantic interoperability; it's the modern authentication patterns such as SMART or UDAP. The \"better encoding\" and easier readability of FHIR is just a bonus! By applying modern authentication, we get modern, scalable trust patterns in intra-org, inter-org, and patient authenticated interoperability.</p>\n<p>For public health, a broad trust agreement with a centralized registry, akin to Carequality, would be a massive level up over today's \"connect point to point with 64 different trust policies/processes\"</p>",

When you say labs \"onboard\" onto each state's inter org trust policies, what exactly are you referring to?  You mention authentication patterns like SMART and UDAP hold the most promise, but then say there is a need for a broad trust agreement and centralized registry.  In your opinion, are the authentication patterns complementary to a centralized registry (enabler or other).  It would seem that the centralized registry would be a workaround to a lack of implementation of modern authentication patterns, but interested in your perspective here.
