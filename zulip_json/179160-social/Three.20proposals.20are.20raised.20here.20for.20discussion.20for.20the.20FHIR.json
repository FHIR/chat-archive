For some systems and types of exchanges, multiple messages an hour is overload.  For others, less than 100/second is a sign some of their participants are probably having network issues.  Guidance about things like \"number of layers\" almost always belongs in an implementation guide where the implementation guide can establish a shared set of expectations in which establishing such architectural expectations is reasonable/realistic.</p>",
