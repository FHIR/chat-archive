In the medium to long-term nobody benefits from poor experiences, but given that the January Connectathon is so close to the Xmas/New Year Holiday Season I don't think that this is the time to close registrations early.</p>",

I'm not suggesting we copy that process verbatim, but it odes help to ensure attendees have done their bit prior to attending. But unless you make this sort of a thing mandatory (and have a means of testing) there will always be participants who are ill prepared. You can remind, cajole, or threaten the attendees into looking at stuff, but some will still not be prepared. That's their own problem, as long  as that doesn't hinder the other participants too much. If as Grahame says this gas risen to a level where's it's becoming annoying for other participants, then we'll have to do something.</p>",

As I see it, the problematic user group to cater for in virtual connectathons is the 'newbie' one - given that many of the educators have limited time to run dedicated sessions for them on topics such as 'how to build a FHIR server'. It's easier, and cheaper, for this group to attend virtual events but maybe HL7 should offer a different type of 'event' for them? It's really hard to serve 600+ people at one time. For the remining groups, I think that the approach the HL7 India (and others) has taken, in terms of pre-event preparation and registration deadlines, is a good one.</p>",
