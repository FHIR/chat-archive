The v2 structure generation is really not easy to get going- It only works on Windows XP (seriously) and we maintain a hacked copy of the database that it uses, so I maintain a VM for this purpose.</p>\n<p>This really should get rewritten, but it would be a crazy amount of work and I just can't see myself finding the time...</p>",
