Not all my activity is sponsered by my employer (most definetly is) so I can't say its always work - but its work related. I wonder if anyone else struggles with comming up with a proper explanation besides 'its just because it interests me and I wan't to do good' <span aria-label=\"joy\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f602\" role=\"img\" title=\"joy\">:joy:</span> - my wife just don't understand that can be the reason</p>",
