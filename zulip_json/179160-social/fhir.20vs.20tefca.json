My company does EHR privacy auditing and has support for major EHR vendors through database exports from their data warehouse, and now I'm trying to understand how to integrate with the long-tail of other systems that are used within health systems. The hope is that FHIR is at least a partial solution using AuditEvent and bulk export. I also recently stumbled across TEFCA which seems to be an attempt at the federal level to have interoperability with the hospitals similar to what is done at the state HIE level. Do you all know if building to FHIR will account for most of what is desired in TEFCA, or are they two separate entities doing divergent things?</p>",
