If you could repost your question there, that would be very useful. I'll see to someone answering it. But since the HL7 WGM starts Saturday, the key contributors will be busy traveling and conferencing. So you may need a little patience. Or, if you happen to go there yourself, be sure to visit the Monday evening API meeting.</p>",
