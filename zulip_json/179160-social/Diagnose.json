EX: ICD-10/11 contain a lot of laterality data and SNOMED CT is able to resolve to a very specific body site, but I don't think it directly conveys laterality.<br>\n2) Supplement the coded concept with bodysite data (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/condition-definitions.html#Condition.bodySite\">http://hl7.org/fhir/condition-definitions.html#Condition.bodySite</a>)</p>\n<p>\"Only used if not implicit in code found in Condition.code. If the use case requires attributes from the BodySite resource (e.g. to identify and track separately) then use the standard extension bodySite. May be a summary code, or a reference to a very precise definition of the location, or both.\"</p>\n<p>The approach would be dependent upon your use case and agreement with downstream consumers. </p>\n<p>I would really be curious to know how others approach this. Personally, I think I've been lucky to get get reliable coded condition data . Having a separate body site definition or even encountering a specific enough code to convey body site would be make me crazy happy (I need to get out more).</p>",
