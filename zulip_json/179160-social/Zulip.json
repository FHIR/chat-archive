Under the implementation column and the Code: bullet point, I clicked Java and it downloaded a zip file. Pulling that into a new Java project and running a simple build shows the entire org.hl7.fhir.instance.model.api package is missing. Was looking for some guidance on this process. I hope that adds a bit more clarification :) </p>",
