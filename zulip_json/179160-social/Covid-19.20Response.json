I need a few days work to complete the refactoring and updating, planned as a new Swift Package Manager (SPM) package for QuestionnaireKit.  PM me if you have examples with specific requirements.  I did not include other aspects of the C3-PRO framework, only Questionnaire rendering and QR results.  Full credit to the original developer from Boston Children's, of course!!!</p>",
