I take no issue with this. </p>\n<p>My points are very technical but basically, if you are exchanging data on behalf of the member, you run into all sorts of issues if you try and cut the patient out of the transfer. This is because of deep identity and trust issues that are present in cross-system communications in healthcare. These issues can be addressed, mostly, but for a member/patient facilitated use case it just does not make sense to try and cut the patient out of the transaction.</p>",

I think CMS estimated the cost to each plan at 1-2 million. There are about 300 plans, plus I have not heard anyone mention the cost to providers. If we can allow the application development ecosystem fill these roles I think we all win. App developers can take advantage of an economy of scale that a single data  source could never reach.</p>",

Where as in healthcare a failure to authenticate is quite common, due to the fact that patients need healthcare when they are NOT healthy. A failure here is much more harmful, delays cause pain (prevent pain from being addressed as soon as possible), and can cause far worse than pain including long-term damage or death.</p>\n<p>I am all for a national Identifier.. I have been pushing for it for decades. It would be very helpful for safety. I believe it is critical to ENABLE Privacy, and it makes me angry that the public statement against it is presented as \"Privacy\" problem. The real reason we don't have a national identifier is because it takes away rich demographics that are valuable in data mining.     a national identifier is just that, and identifier. Not authentication. As an identifier the queries do not need to be using rich demographics, things that change as people marry and move around.  Thus a match is binary. A failure to match, causes an exception processing that likely takes a long time and involves people that are audited.  A positive match brings positive linkage to Privacy preferences and consents.</p>\n<p>Not to say that the identifier can't also enable authenticated identity assertions that have greater usefulness... (my bank number is just a number, but when I use my ATM card, the card is challenged with the pin and produces a assertion token. Totally distributed.

The decision to use a patient-centric exchange network vs a member facilitated peer-to-peer network will not have any impact on the effort required by the patient. Once patient's can begin to interact in a meaningful way with their data they will become more engaged anyway. For example, I know that when I go to a new doctor it can feel like starting a new care journey, from scratch. If we can get the patients their (damn) data, they can forward the data to the provider or at least have it available to help the discussions.  But again, I think patient engagement is an an apples and oranges discussion when related to how healthcare data should be exchanged. To me the obvious choice is that the patient should mediate all exchanges, outside of business-to-business relationships (end users are business associates or covered entities).</p>",

The member has to engage to allow data to be transferred on their behalf, e.g. opt-into peer-to-peer exchanges. This will always be true since the application end users we are servicing are not business associates and we can not treat the payer-to-payer and payer-to-provider exchanges as business-to-business connections (we cannot trust our end users to declare access rights, sorry patients/members of other plans/systems!).</p>",

I will include a section addressing these points.</p>\n<p>I think there is a misconception that a member-centric model will require the member to engage more than a peer-to-peer model. We have to engage the member/patient to initiate/authorize all payer-to-X transactions. The process will always involve collecting prior plan identifiers from the member/patient while they are logged into their current member portal (or have active access token). In payer-to-payer the intent is to retrieve historical data and have it collect in one place. This seems to reduce the need for long lived connections (or transfers that occur without patient/member engagement). In a member-centric model, the same effort/engagement would have created a long lived data source.</p>\n<p>On the payer-to-provider side, we have more of a direct need for long lived communications from a payer to a provider. This process will begin via member/patient opt in. In a member-centric model,  the opt-in process would be achieved by adding the provider as a data source. The advantage of this method is the member/patient will also gain full access to the provider's other data/functionality. A long lived offline access token will easily enable long lived connections. </p>\n<p>If we want to make things even easier, We could also consider automatically linking to personal health data cloud when people get portal access too. This may be represented as an opt-in option to have data automatically sync to a health data cloud platform. This could also be done nearly automatically via an opt-in option as part of the portal creation. This would allow for data to flow as needed between holders with no patient/member engagement.</p>",

These “E” patients are equipped, enabled, empowered, and engaged. For the types of patients that are highly engaged, a member-centric model is highly preferred. This model will allow the patient a chance to verify the accuracy of all health data. This will allow the patient important opportunities to assist healthcare providers maintain the accuracy of the patient’s medical chart. The member-centric design will also enable the “E” patient to tightly control what information is released, when information is released, and where the information will go. As many patient advocates point out, the patient’s ability to improve medical data cannot be overlooked. A peer-to-peer model, which skips the patient, will make it much more difficult for patients to help with their own care. To quote e-Patient Dave, “Let Patients Help!”</p>\n<p>As another “E” patient advocate mentioned, they would like to be notified when their data is shared. In a member facilitated peer-to-peer model this would require even more expensive infrastructure to support. A member-centric model will allow the “E” patient maximum control because they will be mediating all transactions (automatically or manually). \"</p>",

I think this looks good. </p>\n<p>To underscore a reason for my desire to know what is being shared between health orgs....I am the POA for my 92 year old mom with Alzheimer's. I know her medical history and her medication list. I go with her to the doctor and confirm them in person. A few months ago, after confirming my mom's medications before a surgery (in person), I called to check on my mom again after surgery. The nurse told me she was on her way to give mom her meds. I asked what meds she was administering. She listed the meds she was about to give mom...a list of meds that had been discontinued 2 years prior because of side effects were in her hand and she was on her way to mom's room. I asked her where she got that old discontinued list. She said it was pulled in from a prior health org in another state. I explained that was old data and i did not want mom taking those drugs. Even though I was there in person before her surgery to give the clinic the updated list of mom's meds...they were overruling my information with old data from another system. I don't believe this is a rare occasion. If I would have received an email letting me know that information was being pulled from a old clinic in another state, i could have called and stopped the process earlier. (They had already given her at least one dose of the meds before i found out.)</p>",

I think it is important to distinguish between publicly funded data analytics that leverage publicly funded health informatics infrastructure versus private sector initiatives that \"steal\" PHI and use it for purely self-serving, commercial purposes. The slope is fundamentally less slippery in the context of universal health coverage programmes that look to create large, de-identified data sets that may be leveraged as (and further contribute to) <strong><em>global public goods</em></strong>. Some very important initiatives are being progressed within this context, including work by WHO towards a global learning health system. We should want to encourage and support this important and noble work. I also believe there is domestic work by CDC in the same vein -- towards a learning health system for the USA.</p>",

This may be psychiatric notes, for example. This data can still flow between data holders using patient-centered connections (post, put, get endpoints of patient access API). The personal health cloud can contain data that a patient does not have access to, in theory. Only business-to-business applications would be allowed to move this data. </p>\n<p>Similar to the trust issues we see with member facilitated B2B connections, there are also trust issues when using a consumer application to communicate data needed for business processes.

The effect is that the systems that protect, control, and monitor the flow of data for a given subject (patient) has a need now that has not existed before. This is why the view needs to be patient centric. But this is also why we need to move away from the historic models that controls the data only at the custodian of the data. That model might scale, from the custodians perspective; but it does not scale from the patients perspective. Especially when the patient has received care at 100 or 1000 sites.  as that 100-1000 sites problem, means the patient themselves needs to manage 100-1000 custodian based privacy policies.

Many read the federal laws and find no room for doing anything else, while others read federal laws and see no way the current system is allowed.

This does not mean that there is only one policy, but rather that there is a clear and agreed way that all the states/regions/organizations policies work together. It is these edges of policies touching policies that cause the biggest problem.</p>",

As such, I appreciate any feedback you are willing to share, Dave. </p>\n<p>Here is a summary:</p>\n<p>We have an opportunity to rapidly accelerate health data exchanges, reduce waste, and improve Patient Access. We can achieve these benefits through a small technical correction to the DaVinci PDex Implementation Guide (IG). PDex IG defines how payers and providers must share patient information during consumer-facilitated business-to-business transactions. The PDex IG is not finalized. There is still time to provide technical feedback and suggestions.</p>\n<p>This proposal allows every Payer and Provider owned application to PULL information from existing Patient Access API connections and PUSH data in a format that conforms to the DaVinci B2B IG. The existing PDex IG requires data producers to PULL data from two new B2B sources, e.g., Payer Access API and Provider Access API. Instead of segmenting the patient's data and creating new connections, we can leverage existing Patient Access to PULL data.</p>\n<p>A consumer-facing application that is connected to many healthcare data providers is powerful. This type of application can be created by the public or private sectors and deployed within existing Payer and Provider portals. In order for an application to participate in B2B transactions, it must be owned by a Payer or Provider (to enable HIPAA protections). A member or patient would interface with the application within an existing portal session.</p>\n<p>Here is the exciting part: if the application exposed within a payer or provider portal already has access to consumer connections, the application will function as a consumer-directed B2B highway. This is an essential step toward allowing health data to flow freely.</p>\n<p>In other words, if aggregator applications like Apple Health or CommonHealth provided a mechanism for a patient/member to link their consumer application login with a payer/provider-hosted application, we have just created an alternative for a universal healthcare Single-Sign-On (SSO). </p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, there is still time to provide technical feedback and suggestions to IG leads like <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192054\">@Viet Nguyen</span>  and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192609\">@Mark Scrimshire</span>. </p>\n<p>The infographic illustrates an approach to support B2B communications through consumer-directed exchanges (Patient Access API). Focus on Patient Access removes the need for two new B2B health data exchanges. Existing consumer-directed exchanges can be used to communicate data using patient connections.</p>\n<p>The current guidance and CMS policy allow for automatic opt-ins. These automatic opt-ins are laying the groundwork for an exchange network that removes the patient. The current PDex guidance is also burdensome for smaller plans to implement, as evidenced by the many exclusions made for state-based Medicaid/CHIP plans.</p>\n<p>The latest attempt to improve the graphic is here: <br>\n<a href=\"user_uploads/10155/7-XrRTZlYIl5I4TGq5EQIdbt/Consumer-Directed-B2B.PNG\">Consumer-Directed-B2B.PNG</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/10155/7-XrRTZlYIl5I4TGq5EQIdbt/Consumer-Directed-B2B.PNG\" title=\"Consumer-Directed-B2B.PNG\"><img src=\"user_uploads/10155/7-XrRTZlYIl5I4TGq5EQIdbt/Consumer-Directed-B2B.PNG\"></a></div>",
