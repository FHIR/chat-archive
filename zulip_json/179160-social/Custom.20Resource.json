The StructureDefinition will allow you to profile the Basic resource so as to introduce the attributes that you need, these will almost certainly be via the use of extensions. You should look to see whether there are any existing extensions published by HL7 that meet your needs or failing that create your own (which will need more StructureDefinitions). The Search parameters are defined in the CapabilityStatement resource by making use of a SearchParam resource....</p>",
