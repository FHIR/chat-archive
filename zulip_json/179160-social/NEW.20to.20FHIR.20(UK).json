I'm a newcomer to these standards and so looking for anyone (perhaps in the UK) who already does this sort of thing and perhaps can point me in the right direction and/or provide some advice along the way? Or perhaps point me at a third-party SDK / library that already handles this sort of thing? Thanks in advance.</p>",
