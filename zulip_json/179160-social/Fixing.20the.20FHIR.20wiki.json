        "content": "<p>As most of you hopefully know, FHIR has a wiki where we maintain a wide range of information outside of the specification to support both implementation and development.  HL7 is currently in the progress of migrating from that mediawiki-based site to Confluence.  As part of the migration, the FMG is thinking about how to better organize the site to make information easier to discover/use.  There's a general consensus that the current design is a little overwhelming and hard to navigate, but we don't have any specific ideas for how to make it better.  That's where you come in :)</p>\n<p>If you have thoughts about how the wiki could be easier to navigate, please let us know.  You can send me a PM or you can send an email to <a href=\"mailto:fmgcontact@hl7.org\" title=\"mailto:fmgcontact@hl7.org\">fmgcontact@hl7.org</a>.  Open discussion here is fine too.  We're open to simple suggestions, lists of stuff to add/drop/merge/split, or full mock-ups of what a revised site would look like.  If there are specific Confluence plugins you think would make a difference, feel free to propose those too.  Please keep in mind the need to serve three audiences - those who only implement, those who only design and those implementers who also need to profile/create implementation guides.</p>\n<p>We'll be looking at this in earnest in 2-3 weeks, so please provide your ideas by then.  Thanks!</p>",
