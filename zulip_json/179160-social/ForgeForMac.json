So you can't run the application directly on MacOS. Also you can't run Forge on Mono, because Mono doesn't support WPF. As a workaround, you could install Windows within a virtual machine (e.g. Parallels Desktop) and run it from there.</p>",

Forge will add an extension element as a child of the selected parent element.<br>\n- Select the extension element if necessary. In the Properties pane in the right column you can map the extension element to an existing extension definition. The drop-down box provides access to all extension definitions that are currently opened in Forge. Alternatively, you can select \"other...\" and manually enter a canonical url.</p>",
