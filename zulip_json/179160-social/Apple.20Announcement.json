There’s ~150 FHIR servers currently available via Open Epic, and an equal number from Cerner.  Anybody who implements a SMART on FHIR app that conforms to the Argonaut spec and passes QA for both an Epic instance and a Cerner instance can then claim to have access opportunity into 300 hospitals.  Because interoperability.  Add in AllScripts and McKesson; or maybe Redox, etc and I bet one can get to 500.  About 10% of the US hospital market, which is no small feat.  But that might only be a few dozen hospitals in practice.  I don’t think it’s a deep secret so much as interoperability allows companies to make certain types of market opportunity claims that are easy to misinterpret as existing client base.</p>",

I realize I should have been clearer with my goal here. I wasn't really questioning Apple's figure of 500, I'm trying to figure out how to become the \"501st\".  In other words, I am looking for technical documentation on the process and requirements for becoming a provider of such HealthRecords (e.g., what is required in order to publish our lab results and analysis in a way that allows our patients to pull them onto their IoS device).</p>\n<p>I assume it involves standing up some sort of FHIR server. From your reply, I infer that perhaps that server need merely comply with the Argonaut IG.
