To me the concept of 'Streams' has the connotation of real-time, optimized video or audio data for viewing/listening; i.e. it's delivered incrementally.</p>",

In Zephyr, the word for channels/streams was \"Classes\" and the word for topics was \"Instances\". So perhaps you might at least agree that we've made progress in clarity of terms...</p>",
