Second, the best place to ask this sort of question is on <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179166\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers\">#implementers</a>.  <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179160\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179160-social\">#social</a> is for non-implementation-related discussion.  Third, when posting to a stream, make sure to post under a topic that's relevant to your question or, if necessary, create a new topic.  Fourth, in answer to your question, take a look at the genomics implementation guide.  (And if you have questions after reading it, you'll find the folks hanging out at <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179197\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179197-genomics\">#genomics</a> quite helpful.)  Fifth - welcome to the community :)<br>\n(I'm going to delete the extra posts you accidentally created.)</p>",
