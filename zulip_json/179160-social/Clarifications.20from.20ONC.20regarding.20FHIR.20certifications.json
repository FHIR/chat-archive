It labels <code>DiagnosticReport.performer</code> as 'must-support', and indicates that it can either be a US practitioner, or a US organization. Should a lab seek certification (I know this is not the current context), it makes no sense to require them to demonstrate that they can report a US practitioner as performer if their policy is that the lab as a whole is always the performer.
