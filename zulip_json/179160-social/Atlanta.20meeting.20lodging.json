In this case I'm pinched, and of course having an apartment with full kitchen and \"en suite\" laundry is hard to beat for economy, at 60% less than hotel list price.  (I'm saying this for others, not to convince you!) My 5 nights including all fees will be $474; same at $199/night would be $995+taxes = ~$1200.  </p>\n<p>Yay for choices, I say.</p>",

Over the past few years, I've certainly been grateful for those options when self-funding to attend HL7 and SNOMED meetings. Fortunately, HL7NZ is funding my accommodation for this one - particularly as I've never been to Atlanta before. At the last WGM in Montreal, I stayed at a cheap and comfortable YWCA just down the road from the meeting venue. However, for a foreigner anyway, the USA these days is a different proposition - it's an awful long time since I traveled extensively in the US on a shoestring budget and even back then I had some close encounters.</p>",

True e-patients - empowered and engaged!</p>\n<p>When the Portsmouths saw us both in the paper they reached out and we had a brief meet-up mid-conference.
