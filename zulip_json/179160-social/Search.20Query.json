And each of the resources refers patient and practitioner resource. Then, as I think the number of total connections to obtain all the encounter resources with individual patient and practitioner name is 201. Because 1 connection to get search set bundle, 100 connections to get each patient name and 100 connections to get each practitioner name as they all are referred. I believe this is very inefficiency and there is a solution for this case. If anyone knows, please help me</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance</p>",
