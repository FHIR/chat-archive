Just append a suffix to the topic name. (MIT's \"Zephyr\" chat system was an inspiration for Zulip; there, we had a convention of appending <code>.d</code> to topic names to indicate \"further side discussion\". This sometimes led to to topics like <code>My topic.d.d.d.d</code> for sub-sub-sub-sub discussions ;-))</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I say boo hiss :-) and assert hand-waving.  Zulip is a lot more \"thready\" (emphasis on thread titles) and as this very thread illustrates, the subject of this \".d\" bears no resemblance to the content. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
