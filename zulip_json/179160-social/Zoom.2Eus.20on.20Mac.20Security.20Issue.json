Proof of Concept linked in the article (site starts a meeting - can chat with everyone else testing it out).  Has steps at end of article to address.</p>",

All, to apply the patch, now <strong>all you need to do is start Zoom and do Check For Updates.</strong></p>\n<p>Is there an award for being disingenuous and/or monumentally stupid?  From the blog post about the patch: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We do not currently have an easy way to help a user delete both the Zoom client and also the Zoom local web server app on Mac that launches our client.  The user needs to manually locate and delete those two apps for now. This was an honest oversight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's what the patch fixed.  But ... seriously?? \"Honest oversight\" - \"Sorry, we accidentally left our web server on your computer\"??</p>",
