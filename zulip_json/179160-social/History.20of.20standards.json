Get's all the important milestones, and I learned a few things myself.  </p>\n<p>$0.02 of feedback might be to scope the title to \"History of Healthcare IT Standards\" or \"History of Healthcare Computing Standards\".  I say that having written a similar article for a Clinical Informatics board review book.  From a clinician perspective, healthcare standards go back to the 1600s with things like the Bills of Mortality and the International Classification of Diseases.  So a lot of the modern-day value sets...  ICD10, LOINC, SNOMED, RxNorm, etc... they can trace their lineage and provenance back a few hundred years.  Whereas the focus of your article is obviously on the computational and telecommunication aspects.</p>",

History doesn't have a geographic center, it's all over the map. CEN (European) standards had a major impact on the thinking behind HL7 v3 and CDA, on the use of EDIFACT in healthcare before v2 hit the European shores in '92, and OpenEHR/13606 (notably missing from your overview, but then again not generally seen as important in the US) has had, and still has, a significant impact on standards like v3, CDA and FHIR. </p>\n<p>The history probably starts a bit earlier than your document, even if we only focus on 'interoperability standards'. The very initial scenario was the communication between lab devices and a lab (mini/mainframe) computer (RS232, based on proprietary formats), and we shouldn't forget about the data formats used for archival on magnetic tapes. Many a format can be traced back to precursor tape formats, and tapes were send by snail mail, so there certainly was an interoperability aspect as well, going back to the early 60s.</p>\n<p>On v3: not just the Netherlands: the UK, Canada, Finland and the Netherlands all heavily invested in v3, as did the US (e.g. with SPL being [an still is, AFAIK] a v3-based mandated format). See <a href=\"http://www.ringholm.com/docs/04500_en_History_of_the_HL7_RIM.htm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.ringholm.com/docs/04500_en_History_of_the_HL7_RIM.htm\">http://www.ringholm.com/docs/04500_en_History_of_the_HL7_RIM.htm</a> for a v3 history. </p>\n<p>In my bit of history I didn't go into NCPDP and X12 (or CCR / C-CDA), these being US specific (and me being oriented on the European market, which has plenty of country specific weird standards of its own, thank you very much). And where's IEEE 11073, and Continua (now: PCHA) ? I know, it's all a bunch of interrelated standards that have influenced each other, so any attempt to describe them in a linear fashion is probably bound to fail anyway... but we try.</p>",
