Answer: I have no frickin' idea. :-)   </p>\n<p>I'm truly looking for a \"hello world\" sort of thing that shows the clueless how a RESTful API works (says Keith), specifically in FHIR.  So, a trivial example might be (making this up without much thought):<br>\n- ping Server 1 to get all my blood pressure data from it<br>\n- another to ping Server 2 to get all my blood pressure data</p>\n<p>I'm sure the response-barf would be wrapped in tags, not prettily formatted pictures. That's exactly what I expect: it would show the data-starved patient observer what FHIR does - pokes the server in the belly and makes it cough up the goods. It's then up to apps (or whatever skills the observer happens to have) to do something with it.  </p>\n<p>Is this a useful response? </p>\n<p>It certainly doesn't need to be real data from a real hospital etc.</p>",

I am just beginning the process of making people aware that such things could even be possible, given how horribly difficult it has often been. Perhaps we'll start to see people asking, \"Can FHIR get it??\" when faced with access problems. THAT would be perfect, wouldn't it. <span aria-label=\"slight smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"slight smile\">:slight_smile:</span></p>",
