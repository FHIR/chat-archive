If you need only couple of it and already have an existing database schema - you can do transformation from/to FHIR on flight (as Lloyd recommended). We tried the last approach  for NPI registry, which contains only Organisations &amp; Practitioners. We are working on FHIR storage, query &amp; analytic track for next the connectathon in Germany, you are welcome to describe you problem/solution, so we will add it to track.</p>",
