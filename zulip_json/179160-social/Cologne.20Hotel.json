I have a non-refundable booking for May 11 to 17th at <a href=\"https://www.adagio-city.com/gb/hotel-8288-aparthotel-adagio-koln-city/index.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.adagio-city.com/gb/hotel-8288-aparthotel-adagio-koln-city/index.shtml\">https://www.adagio-city.com/gb/hotel-8288-aparthotel-adagio-koln-city/index.shtml</a> (serviced apartment, 100 meters from the conference hotel). Cancellation means paying a 95%+ penalty. Do you still need a room? This one's available cheaply. <br>\nPlease contact me via private message or e-mail.</p>",
