Also discussed are alternatives for sanitizing and reusing equipment - generally not recommended, but since the existence of this discussion means we're basically in a war zone, it's good to have something sane to point to.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://learnly.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mask-ppe-EBM-3-19-20-4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://learnly.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mask-ppe-EBM-3-19-20-4.pdf\">What are good ways to address the shortage of face masks by anesthesiologists?</a></p>\n<p>p.s.
