I was especially cautious about this new report from Deloitte, because consultants who talk about patient communities so often do it from the boardroom's perspective, without viewing anything from the patient's view. </p>\n<p>But at first glance I like the look of this, so I'll be back to dig deeper. <br>\n<a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/smart-health-communities.html?_lrsc=b0890039-4d91-4105-a463-df453050e645\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/smart-health-communities.html?_lrsc=b0890039-4d91-4105-a463-df453050e645\">Smart health communities and the future of health</a>  This rings true for me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...  a concept we call smart health communities (SHCs), which we define as containing some or all the following core features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They empower individuals to proactively manage their health and well-being;</li>\n<li>They foster a sense of community and belonging;</li>\n<li>They use digital technology and behavioral science;</li>\n<li>They use data to meaningfully improve outcomes; and</li>\n<li>They create new and innovative ecosystems.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It should be easy to see the relevance of FHIR to this concept - and vice versa.  The DevDays Patient Innovator Track might do well to consider this model as one context for the value of innovations.</p>",
