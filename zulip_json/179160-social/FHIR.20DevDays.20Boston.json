We will visit the Lucky Strike Social, an area staple located behind Fenway Park, where you can drink, eat, and socialize with colleagues and friends. Hang out in the brewery and play ping pong, billiards, or maybe even shuffleboard. And, there is plenty of action available in the high-tech game room and 16-lane bowling alley. Registration is open at <a href=\"https://www.fhirdevdays.com/boston/registration/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.fhirdevdays.com/boston/registration/\">https://www.fhirdevdays.com/boston/registration/</a>.
