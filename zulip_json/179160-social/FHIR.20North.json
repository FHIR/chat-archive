For $150 (Canadian!), you get almost 20 hours of content plus networking opportunities.  Some of the sessions I'm looking forward to include \"If FHIR is so easy, why is it so hard?\", \"How to build an interoperable IG - that will get adopted\", \"FHIR as an EMR import/export standard\", and of course Grahame's closing keynote \"10 year systems review: Is FHIR having a healthy outcome?\".<br>\nAnd because it's all virtual, you don't even have to brave an October in Hamilton.  (We'll even let in non-Canadians).</p>",
