Suggestion to where to go? For NZ looking at north (flying to Kerikeri) / far south fiordland (flying to Queenstown) / or Wellington? For Austalia skip north - wet season, and do Sydney - Melbourne - Adelaide? - Alice Springs? Tasmania? In general we like outdoors / hiking and also driving around.</p>",

If you like hiking, try the Tongariro crossing / NZ, Fiordland / NZ and Coromandel / NZ. Blue mountains in AU. Way too many nice places, even for a 5 week trip.</p>",

Should you only have 10 days in NZ, you'd probably make better use of time by sticking to one of the two main islands. Central North Island offers quite a good variety of outdoor activities and Maori culture (Rototura, Lake Taupo, Tongariro Crossing, etc.) and it's an easy drive over to the Bay of Plenty if you fancy a day at the beach. The South Island merits more time and the main centres of Queenstown and Wanaka will still be overflowing in early Feb.</p>",
