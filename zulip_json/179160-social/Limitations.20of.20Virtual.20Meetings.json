The virtual DevDays had a 'pub crawl' and in general tries to still facilitate ad-hoc discussions, but as the blogpost cited by you already states this is much harder to do in a Zoom-like virtual setting. We'll try, we keep an eye out as to what others are doing, and we're open for suggestions. (As a trainer I read a lot of blogs about online events, and there have been some suggestions that may work for DevDays as well).</p>\n<p>If we all put our VR goggles on, and we're free to roam some virtual hallways and chat to random other attendees, then yes, going virtual may approach the same sort of experience that a F2F meeting offers. For now (as humans, to establish or strengthen inter-human bonds) we do need the occasional F2F meeting. As long as that's not in the cards we'll have to make do, and accept its drawbacks.</p>",
