Followed up with the HL7 FHIR exam preparation course and having studied the concepts way more with practice quizzes given took the practice test again in which I did way better on and then passed the #proficiencyexam. Good way to take it all in and really understand it.</p>",

Great to hear about the benefits of the prep course <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"382973\">@JBH Solutions</span> and certainly practice tests would definitely help.with the exam. I sat R4 a while back (July 2019) and certainly some serious time investment was needed. Doing the fundamentals courses helped (and I'd imagine the new comprehensive exam prep course also) to improving the likelihood of passing. Dedication, perseverance and hard work should get you there <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"369239\">@Pradeep Podila</span>.

Still, there are only a very few resources to find information about the exam from ones who took it, and how to get prepared (I found less than 5). So feel free to share and those who like to join the next study group can comment on the article. We already have a few interested, so I'm hoping to get it started for them. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hl7-fhir-r4-certification-guide-self-study-path-janaka-peiris/?trackingId=ZeQtDFRFT%2FigbxkULKoHTg%3D%3D\">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hl7-fhir-r4-certification-guide-self-study-path-janaka-peiris/?trackingId=ZeQtDFRFT%2FigbxkULKoHTg%3D%3D</a></p>",
