From the report:<br>\nThe initiative, code-named \"Project Nightingale,\" appears to be the largest in a series of efforts by Silicon Valley giants to gain access to personal health data and establish a toehold in the massive health-care industry. <a href=\"http://Amazon.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Amazon.com\">Amazon.com</a>, Apple and Microsoft are also aggressively pushing into health care, though they haven't yet struck deals of this scope. Google launched the effort last year with St. Louis-based Ascension, the country's second-largest health system. The data involved in Project Nightingale includes lab results, doctor diagnoses and hospitalization records, among other categories, and amounts to a complete health history, complete with patient names and dates of birth.\"</p>",

In fact, it's one of the things we're trying to enable - allowing third parties to define analytical algorithms, decision support processes, etc. that can consume data from others and provide useful advice/guidance.   <br>\n Few hospitals can afford to develop that expertise in-house and running the algorithms against larger data sets (even if partitioned) makes the algorithms better and less biased.</p>\n<p>So long as the data aren't used for purposes they're not supposed to be and are kept appropriately segregated and the sharing is done within appropriate legal frameworks, there's no issue.</p>\n<p>Now, if you don't <em>trust</em> Google (or Microsoft or Apple or Amazon or whomever) to adhere to the legal agreements they've signed, then you might have cause for anxiety.

The Guardian's piece refers to a video, which is total bunk. Google's Cloud business unit (just like AWS, Azure, Oracle Cloud) provides services to businesses where the data is most definitely segregated and not used in any of the their social networking/advertising business. Without that segregation, no one would be using these services.</p>\n<p>Can this lead to problems, if something is misconfigured? Yes, just like it would happen if Ascension misconfigures a server or gets malware on their computers.</p>\n<p>The only part that could be considered going beyond providing IT services to Ascension is the use of the data as source for machine learning. It sounds like this part of the agreement is far from started, and is still being figured out. The Google response is at <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/our-partnership-with-ascension\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/our-partnership-with-ascension\">https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/our-partnership-with-ascension</a>.

If the Ascension was doing this themselves, patient consent certainly wouldn't be required.  It's not reasonable to seek patient consent every time a healthcare provider outsources an IT function - which it appears is all that's happening here.  Patients certainly should expect that appropriate data custody and protections are in place when outsourcing occurs, but the parties claim that has happened here.

That may expose how they provide value add to their competitors.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of reasons why this sort of information isn't commonly publicized.  Do you know who you provider uses to connect to your insurer?  B/c they likely use a service to do it.  Do you know who your HCP uses to handle their billing?  They likely don't do it themselves.  A lot of these functions are outsourced to organizations that specialize in that function, and can therefore take advantage of economies of scale that aren't available to the single organization that needs that function.</p>\n<p>Should there be different rules for BIG names like Ascension or Google with regard to publication of this sort of relationship?  Why?</p>\n<p>FWIW: For Google, and any other, this activity has to be firewalled from activities in other parts of the business, and very likely, separate business entities have to be created to ensure that firewall is strong.  I strongly suspect that Google wholly owns the company that does the work, and that company has access to Google technology and services, but that the reverse is not true with regard to the data that organization has access to.<br>\nA similar thing happens to healthcare systems which also provide their own healthcare plans, and there's a lot of attention on these sort of relationships to ensure that private data remains accessibly only to the entity that provides the service (healthcare, or insurance).</p>",
