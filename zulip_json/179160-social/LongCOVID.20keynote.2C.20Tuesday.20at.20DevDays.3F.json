PM me (and/or Hannah) or discuss here.  We can share her draft talk with you, if you want.</p>\n<p>Hannah is a leader of the LongCOVID <a href=\"https://patientresearchcovid19.com/\">patient-led research group</a> that arose in the <a href=\"https://www.wearebodypolitic.com/covid19\">18,000 member LongCOVID Slack community</a> on Body Politic, as written up in <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/12/1006602/covid-19-long-haulers-are-organizing-online-to-study-themselves/\">MIT Technology Review in August</a> and in Ed Yong's <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/long-haulers-covid-19-recognition-support-groups-symptoms/615382/\">potent piece in Atlantic</a>, aptly title and subtitled:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Long-Haulers Are Redefining COVID-19</strong><br>\nWithout understanding the lingering illness that some patients experience, we canâ€™t understand the pandemic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That subtitle is precisely what's at stake in Hannah's talk. The question is, how can the FHIR community help? </p>\n<p>This is big stuff: the BMJ's August article <a href=\"http://bit.ly/BMJlong\">http://bit.ly/BMJlong</a> with <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/370/bmj.m3026/F1.large.jpg\">primary care guidance poster</a> has an Altmetric score (coverage in media &amp; social media) of nearly 5000, one of the highest scores ever despite being only 3 months old.</p>\n<p>Again: how can FHIR help?</p>",
