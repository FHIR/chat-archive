If it is an out-of-band registration process, I would assume that the registration process needs to know about the capabilities.  At minimum, App B would need to know how the capabilities are defined, since just posting a resource wouldn't link anything between the two, and there is no guarantee that an arbitrary App B even supports a given resource.</p>\n<p>For your second question, the <a href=\"https://hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement.html\">CapabilityStatement</a> includes resources and which ones are supported, though it's not the same workflow you are describing.  An endpoint (e.g., App A) has a CapabilityStatement and App B can check to see if the operation it <em>wants</em> to use is supported.  This makes sense, because if App A does not support <code>serviceRequest</code>, there is no negotiation which will add that during registration.</p>\n<p>If you are developing both apps (A and B), then I think those resources should work.  If you are asking about a generic procedure, I don't believe there is one (yet).</p>",
