As a collaborative meeting tool for HL7, I feel it's safer than other options we've explored, and Zoom is more capable for avoiding interlopers than GoToMeeting and FCC, which we've also used.   But I wouldn't post my ATM PIN on Zoom.  Most of the problems are due to inexperienced users (for example, sharing meeting IDs on social media).
