Regulations need to be specific about the \"outcome\" they desire, not the \"current best practice to achieve that outcome is XYZ\".  Regulations move way too slow to keep up with technology, but more importantly technology can move faster than any regulation ever could. Mandate the \"outcome\" and everyone will optimize the \"solution\". The solution is often built upon working solutions, almost never is it a totally different technology. Comparing Healthcare to Netflix is not fair. Netflix is a single business that can act on a business driven policy. Healthcare, especially in the USA, is hodgepodge of parties with their own view of what optimum is. Left without policy of the right outcomes, it will never optimize for the whole.</p>",

They are constituted of diverse and divergent interests, more often competitors than collaborators, and ensuring uniform adoption is like herding cats.\"</p>\n<p>My whole point of that section is that crossing the chasm is hard enough for a private company, but the complexity of standards makes it nearly impossible without luck or a transformative change.

With so many use cases, trying to assign valuations to each reason (IMHO) doesn't have much value.</p>\n<p>As an example, FHIR is more readable than V2.  I can pick up an arbitrary JSON or XML representation, even via wire capture, and understand what it is - both overall, and each element therein.  When I spent more time with V2 (now I sound like an old curmudgeon), there were sets of messages/segments I could do that with because I spent enough time with those exact ones.  Today, I need to look up definitions and count separators.</p>\n<p>Does this matter to you in your use case?  Probably not.  Any company that has been working with V2 has tooling built out such that this doesn't matter.  But, if you have ever tried to migrate <em>old</em> data (e.g., no software available) or interop with an old/unsupported legacy system, readable representations are better to work with.  If you have a new team/developer, JSON or XML is much more familiar than arbitrary pipe-syntax data.  If you are building a new AI model and want to train it, it's easier... and so on.</p>\n<p>But because of that, V2 is smaller over the wire.  There's a tradeoff here, but hopefully it's moving the needle towards \"better\" for the industry as a whole.  If it isn't, I think everyone would be interested in knowing so those things can be addressed.</p>\n<p>The way I see it, most people aren't interested in doing this much work without a good reason.  There was plenty of work available with V2, so it isn't a matter of \"I need to invent something to have something to do\".  If V2 met all of the modern needs and challenges, there wouldn't be a FHIR (nor would there have been V3).  That said, software is just time and effort - if you want to solve a problem using V2, someone can figure it out.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Eh, I think the biggest thing to keep in mind is that these kinds of changes take time.  Whatever you are thinking? More time that that. =)</p>\n<p>Medical devices in particular have long cycles.  I'm a few years out from field interactions, but for me it wasn't uncommon to be dealing with systems that were 5 or 10 years old within a given facility.  I know of a DICOM archive, still operating today, that I installed almost 20 years ago.  It uses a Magneto-Optical library for near-term storage, if that helps explain how old it is.  That system does not receive any sort of updates because both the hardware and software companies that made those products are gone; the products were deprecated as End of Life... a decade ago?  But the archive works, talks with all the modalities they have onsite, and any new systems must interoperate with it*.  That means that software installed there cannot use things like DICOM-web (which didn't exist at the time) without the additional work of a proxy of some sort.  Yes, that is more work for someone who wants to use the new areas of the spec.  But no, I don't see an alternative without replacing their systems - which nobody can force them to do.</p>\n<p>*the physician-owner of the facility plans to retire \"soon\", so it isn't worth replacing everything.  It has been that way for years.</p>\n<p>Especially with web technologies (though by no means restricted to them), people have become used to instant changes and forklift upgrades (e.g., changing CSS libraries).  Healthcare can't do that.  Devices need to go through approvals to ensure patient safety, and even new <em>versions</em> of software need to be tested extensively, which takes time and money.  The more extensive the changes, the more time (and money) that goes into that process.  At this level, we need to iterate fast and hard on the specifications in order to provide a safe and stable space for implementers.  If the benefits outweigh the costs, the industry will transition.</p>\n<p>So in my view, progress is painful and feels slow, but the long-term benefits are still there.  In the meantime, yes, there are many use cases that will use one standard, the other standard, or even mixes of the two.  Not that we shouldn't work to mitigate the pain of it, but as far as I know it's unavoidable.</p>\n<p>As far as the potential to fail - sure!  Well, sort of.  Maybe before FHIR is truly ubiquitous we'll need a new version (FHIRv2 would have my vote to confuse everyone =).  But even if that happens, what we are doing and learning will get rolled into it.  Eventually, there will be a new \"winner\", where new systems won't go through the effort of implementing the old specs anymore.</p>",

        "content": "<p>HL7v2 has a lot of \"pre-computer-science\" history.  I remember talking with folks who were there in the days of V1.x and the \"represtatation language\" was not even a well-formed computer grammar, which is why parsers for it were (and are) few and far between and are built specifically for it (can't use standard off-the-shelf tooling).   However, to be fair, V2 was created before \"the Internet\" as we know it, in fact, before TCP/IP if I remember right and early interfaces were RS-232 only (if you remember what that is/was) ;-).  </p>\n<p>However, some of the problems being solved were not just about wire protocols or transports, etc., they were (and are) fundamentally about semantics.   V2 folks recognized this an established the Andover Working Group to start to address this problem.   In fact, many of the conformance concepts of FHIR are inherited from V2 Conformance work except with more modern computer technologies, e.g. XML/JSON (*), etc.    When I first made the \"jump\" from V2 to FHIR it was nice to be able to use modern tooling but to me much of it was a \"different representation syntax\" -- Resources vs Segments, fields vs properties, etc.  It also seems to me that FHIR extensions are the equivalent of the \"bad boy of the V2 world\", Z-segments.   It seems that there is a proliferation of FHIR extensions and profiles and IGs that maybe help constrain systems to meet common interoperability patterns, but each system needs to be able to understand those IG/profiles/extensions (just like V2 Conformance profiles) in order to get semantic interoperability.     FHIR might have the advantage of being able to specific this via computer exchangeable mechanisms but if any system in the workflow doesn't understand any of the extensions, that piece of the interoperability will still be missing.  (I still don't know if IG/profile/extension \"stacks\" can work on FHIR servers - i.e. where a server has to support multiple profiles that do not necessarily have the same common base other than FHIR Rx.)</p>\n<p>I think the biggest advantages of FHIR are 1. that it uses computer standard technologies so that Comp-sci trained folks coming out of schools can jump right in and be productive (unlike V2) and 2. it doesn't require a PhD in Modeling Design (like V3) in order to understand the FHIR 'data model'.    [Then again, I suspect openFHIR might be \"just as good\" as FHIR, but it just hasn't got as much traction as FHIR??)</p>\n<p>(*) - in fact V2 used XML Schema and Scematron for validation tooling; I believe it took a while for FHIR to add the equivalent validation tooling</p>",
