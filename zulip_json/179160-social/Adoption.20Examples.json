Many of the stumbling blocks have been accessing data and lack of developer resources, of which a FHIR seems to be addressing. </p>\n<p>I'm curious if there is anyone else who is in a similar stage?</p>\n<p>A project I have in mind for a FHIR effort is using MyChart to message patients in response to being predicted as a NoShow in sort of a control/test experiment. I'm also looking for other ideas that seem to be low-hanging fruit.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions most welcome!</p>",
