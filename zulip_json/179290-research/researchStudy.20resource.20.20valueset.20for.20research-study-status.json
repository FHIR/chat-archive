If yes, how is \"completed\"  different?  Does it mean that all following of subjects is completed also?</p>",

What is probably more helpful is to look at the state machine the terms represent:  <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/researchstudy.html#statemachine\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/researchstudy.html#statemachine</a>.  You can see here that the sequence is \"Closed to accrual\" &gt; \"closed to accrual and intervention\" &gt; \"closed\".</p>\n<p>However in R5 we separated publication status ResearchStudy.status from the actual status of the study which is now in ResearchStudy.currentState.  This latter attribute uses the same terminology as in R4 with the same typo!  I've raised a jira to correct this: <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-33096\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-33096</a></p>",
