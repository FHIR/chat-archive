We intend to use the AD to generate the ServiceRequest/Task resources and then track them that way.

Also, name me a sponsor, who today or in the next few months will supply sites with a Protocol as PlanDefinition.

Agree that there aren't a whole lot of sponsors expressing computable protocols at the moment, but insofar as they're sharing protocol at all, PlanDefinition is the mechanism to do that in FHIR.  Over time, the degree of computable precision can grow based on the level of sophistication the industry feels is worthwhile.  (And the good news is that there's a great deal of work happening in terms of \"fully\" computable protocols in the clinical decision support space, so there's a different portion of the industry that's forging the trail and building tools that the research community can leverage if/when they're ready.)</p>",

My point of view is getting this done with the mandatory systems we have today - with all their limitations. The bottleneck is the EMR or whatever sofware you have managing the Order Entry - there is no way around that system (for all sort of Orders including Lab Orders) unless you want to break hospital policies. In the 10 or so systems I deal with, I'd be lucky to be able to add a custom key-value pair as additional metadata to the order.  As long as I can keep the  added complexity which Geoff is proposing to be infornt or behind that bottleneck, and just have a small linking reference included in the HIS/CPOE, all is good.  Going over Geoffs' suggestion again It looks doable despite the overhead.</p>",
