I've been working with Hugh to help with the IG repository. I have tried following the instructions found here: <a href=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=IG_Publisher_Documentation\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=IG_Publisher_Documentation\">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=IG_Publisher_Documentation</a></p>\n<p>I've downloaded the SDC IG source from the github repository and looked through that. I've tried modifying items in the /src folder to use the cdisc_lab designation. Things don't seem to be working as I was hoping and the process still has me a bit confused at this point. I have a few questions:</p>\n<p>1. For the /src folder, do we just add the content, excel spreadsheets, text files, xml files, etc., into this folder structure?<br>\n2. The \"jekyll build\" commands will create a /_site folder in the /src tree, which has a copy of the /src tree. Does jekyll do conversion on the excel files, and other formatting options?<br>\n3. In the downloaded SDC IG, I see that there is a /src and a /src-generated folder. What generated that folder?<br>\n4. What tools/process get you from \"provided content\" to a set of HTML files for viewing in a browser?<br>\nI had thought that the igpublisher jar file would do some of this, but it seems to need a JSON file to execute. When I've tried getting the /src folder to generate anything, it doesn't produce a JSON file. So, how does the JSON file get there?</p>\n<p>Any help you can provide would be appreciated.<br>\nThanks.</p>",

That does a bunch of pre-processing (including generating the needed ig.json file) and puts the results in src-generated (including grabbing the current igpublisher jar), then invoking it.  The continuous integration build doesn't do the pre-processing, so src-generated needs to be checked in, even though the content is 'generated'.<br>\nPutting things in the proper folders in the src folder is one step.  The other is referencing them from the [ig].xml file that's at the root of the src folder.<br>\nThere's a bit of documentation here: <a href=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_IG_Framework\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_IG_Framework\">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_IG_Framework</a>, though it's somewhat out-of-date.
