My research topic for my MD is to look into reducing the time to diagnosis for rare genetic kidney disease. The hospital is currently implementing Epic so integrating a tool with it sounds like the best way to do this.</p>\n<p>The question being “how”, in my mind the tool would be a standalone app going through every patient file that changed since the last run and perform some kind of analysis and trigger alerts when it finds something. How should I go about gathering all this information? Is FHIR even the correct technology for this?</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time</p>",

You'll probably need to look at the \"bulk data\" interfaces, as most EHR's standard query interfaces don't support cross-patient query.  In terms of alerts, you could auto-generate Observations into the record, though that doesn't guarantee anyone would look at them.  You could use CDS Hooks to trigger someone to pay attention - and maybe even launch a SMART-on-FHIR app to show the analysis when someone does a patient look-up or otherwise interacts with the patient.</p>",
