I thought the document Bundle should include all the sections from the composition, so shouldn't the immunization resource be in the document Bundle?  Also, should the signature be required in this bundle?</p>\n<p>In RC2 of the IG for the QR resource, I've had issues trying to use custom resources (e.g. HAPI would need code to make it work), so I've used Basic resources with extensions, but there may also be other options.  It seems SUSHI also has issues with this from the shorthand chat, although there is a workaround.  I also looked at making it a logical model, but that doesn't seem quite right either.  Is this solely to pull together data from the other resources to represent the content embedded in the QR code? </p>\n<p>Does the QR code also need an id of the signer so you can find and check the signature?  Either through mCSD if it's in a health worker registry or some way to find it in the NPKD?</p>",
