As we discussed, I'm working on updates to better support 'workflow' type scenarios - eg changes to a careplan over time where each 'scenario' represents an update to the careplan.</p>\n<p>To do this, have a single track (of type resource graph) for these changes (nothing to stop you having multiple tracks for different use cases) with a 'scenario' for each updated. eg if there were 3 changes to a care plan (1. initial creation, 2. assign a new team, 3. add a new goal) then you'd have 3 scenarios. Also nothing to stop you adding a new scenario if you want to track more changes...</p>\n<p>When you do model the different steps (scenarios) then use the 'import graph' that I showed you to bring in the previous graph - then alter it as required. The advantage of this approach is it retains the resource id's for the resource instances, making it easier to view the changes.</p>\n<p>If it helps, replace the word 'scenario' with 'workflow step' in your thinking...</p>\n<p>Let me know if you have any issues...</p>",
