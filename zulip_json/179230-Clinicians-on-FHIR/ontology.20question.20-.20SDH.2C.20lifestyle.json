I am a lifestyle medicine and internal medicine physician.  I am seeking controlled vocabularies or ontologies to use to represent social determinants of health (SDH) and lifestyle medicine concepts like foods, diet, exercise, sleep.  I see LOINC offers some coverage of SDH:  <a href=\"https://loinc.org/sdh/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://loinc.org/sdh/\">https://loinc.org/sdh/</a>    <br>\nIs anyone aware of some noteworthy UMLS or other ontologies to represent these concepts?  Thanks</p>",

I think it might be best to ask this question on the terminology stream (<a href=\"https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/terminology\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/terminology\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/terminology</a>).  I think that we can offer some thoughts and suggestions regarding LOINC and its applicability for your intended use, and may be able to offer some alternatives (including potentially SNOMED CT).  But you're likely to get more detailed discussion there.</p>",
