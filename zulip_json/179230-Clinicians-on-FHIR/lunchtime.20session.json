An iterative process of:<br>\n1. create a track<br>\n2. add the scenarios<br>\n3. quickly create graphs for each scenario (references and text only)<br>\n4. review - does this work?<br>\n5. modify as required,</p>\n<p>With the output being polished tracks. After all, the building of graphs against those tracks can be done any time and anywhere - and (unlike the scenario builder) anyone can view any of the graphs...</p>",
