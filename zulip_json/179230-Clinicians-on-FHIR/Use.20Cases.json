        "content": "<p>Hi all,<br>\nUnfortunately, we didn't get over to Koln this week.  But I thought we would try to contribute a bit by doing an iteration on the Clinicians on FHIR use cases.  If anybody is interested, we've been putting the use cases into a single document, and fleshing it out with narrative, cast of characters, workflow steps, adding a bit of professional graphic design, etc.   </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Ch3YQjpzxg0kPn-BSm2LbBotpwbThfO/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Ch3YQjpzxg0kPn-BSm2LbBotpwbThfO/view?usp=sharing\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Ch3YQjpzxg0kPn-BSm2LbBotpwbThfO/view?usp=sharing</a></p>\n<p>We've actually been running these by our interns, hackathon members, startup members, etc.  They've been quite useful in herding cats; and it just seemed that polishing them up into a brochure that can be handed out at hackathons and such would make sense.  </p>\n<p>These should be generally aligned with the spreadsheets/worksheets that have been handed out at previous working groups.  The intent is to harmonize any discrepancies.  We have some interns who are busy flowcharting them as well; so we'll hopefully be able to soon break them out into individual use cases brochures, comprising: visualization, narrative, cast of characters, workflow, flowchart, and worksheet.  </p>\n<p>I can rebrand the documents with FHIR logo if that's of interest.  We've also been doing a dozen more, including blockchain usecases, medical home use cases, etc.  But for now, I thought I'd start off by sharing the Clinician on FHIR usecases we've been working on.  <br>\nAbigail</p>",
