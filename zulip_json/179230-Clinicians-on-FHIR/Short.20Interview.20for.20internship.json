For my internship I'm doing a small study on how HL7 FHIR can be used to semantically map clinical (research) data. I would like to Interview experts who have already tried to map data with FHIR. I am specifically interested in how FHIR was implemented (what servers, resources were used). Where the mapping was used for and if you succeeded.</p>\n<p>The questions are the following:</p>\n<p>1. How did you use FHIR to map clinical data?<br>\n2. In what setting did you use FHIR? Data extraction, consents, recruitment, data standardization, device integration <br>\n3. How was FHIR implemented? Has your organization a FHIR server integrated? <br>\n4. What FHIR resources did you use?<br>\n5. Is the FHIR mapping still used? <br>\n6. What would you recommend for a new organization to use FHIR?<br>\nIt shouldn't take more than <strong>15 minutes</strong>. Is anyone available for a phone call/zoom call next week?</p>",
