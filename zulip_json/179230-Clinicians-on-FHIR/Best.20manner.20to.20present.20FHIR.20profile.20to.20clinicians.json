What is the best way to present FHIR profile content to clinicians for verification that it covers their clinical needs? <br>\nThe cancer interoperability group would like to show a profile like <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/StructureDefinition-oncology-EstrogenReceptorStatus.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/StructureDefinition-oncology-EstrogenReceptorStatus.html\">EstrogenReceptorStatus</a> and all the attributes it contains to clinicians. The structure definiton rendering in a FHIR IG can be a lot to take in as a clinician not used to looking at things like that.  Are there any tools people have found effective for this?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi Travis - as you indicate, it's something that we've been working on with CF - so would be interested on others opinions! I'm actually working on a re-write at present with a view to making it easier to show and collect this data in the context of a connectathon. First outing will be at an INTEROPen event we're holding in London after the May WGM (and some review at the WGM itself).  I did a quick video yesterday to show progress - feel free to take a look and give me any feedback...   <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/263774117\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://vimeo.com/263774117\">https://vimeo.com/263774117</a>   (Note that this particular variant is for building a scenario with core types. - there's another I'm working on that will be based on a profile (I'll probably convert to a Logical Model first)...</p>",
