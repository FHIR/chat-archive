The main focus would be on the following tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete the tutorial of the FHIR Mapping Language and adjust it to the newest language features</li>\n<li>Test the interoperability of StructureMaps generated by different tooling</li>\n<li>Discuss language limitations seen in different projects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My question would now be if this could be submitted as a FHIR-I track? I could volunteer to organise the track. Anyone else in favour of this idea?</p>",
