That would imply for me that you are supposed to skip the element if it's repeating. However the mapping language tutorial contains a comment saying that the engine is supposed to throw an error: <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mapping-tutorial.html#step6\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mapping-tutorial.html#step6</a></p>\n<p>What would be the preferred way of handling only_one?</p>",
