I have been doing by getting the item where linkID = 'some code', then getting the .answer field, then getting the .valueString or .valueCoding.<br>\nIt looks something like the following, which I have been using for each question in the QR.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>src.item as answerItem where linkId = &#39;some code&#39; -&gt; resource.field1 as nestedField1 then {\n    answerItem.answer as answer -&gt; nestedField1.nestedField2 as nf2 then {\n        answer.valueString as vs -&gt; nf2.nestedField3 = vs;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>On top of this, if the resource field the QR value is being transformed to is a resource type of its own, such as Medication.ingredient.strength.numerator, I also have to get into those nested fields which I have done with a chain of<br>\n<code>then {... get into next nested field}</code> similar to how I get the .valueString from above.<br>\nIs the method I am using bad, and are there any resources/examples that demonstrate better practices?</p>",
