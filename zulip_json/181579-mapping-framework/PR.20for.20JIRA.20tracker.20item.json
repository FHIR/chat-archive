I'm starting to implement a R5 version of the .NET engine and didn't wanted to carry over these old burdens. If I could get permissions, I could prepare a PR so these issues get fixed in the current build. Let me know if you would like that. If yes, I could offer to see if I'm able to apply some of the other open changes to StructureMap.</p>",
