A map that doesn't indicate any structure definitions can still be used, but the type features of the map language can't be used, and such maps typically require special development to integrate the execution of the map into an application.\" Does that mean that maps can use non FHIR model? e.g simple xml schema without converting it on FHIR logical Model can be use as source or target model</p>",
