We shared the code and documentation updates with firely and it was included in their product. To my knowledge our April release is still part of their latest release.  We at Healex do not by default provide a public endpoint. We only do that for connectathons. I'll check with the team whether we can reactivate the endpoint we used for the last connectathon and deploy the latest build.</p>",
