We are using it quite extensively in several projects. Our Mapper comes with a SD Generator for V2. <br>\nWe have a request for X12 which we are still assessing. Since our clients are mostly in Europe it's the first time we're dealing with X12.<br>\nThe V2 Stuff will be presented at the FML Connectathon in May. You can reach out to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"199409\">@Daniel DropuljiÄ‡</span> for more info.</p>",
