Social Security isn't an insurance program, so I would think SB would be more appropriate.  For MBI and HICN (and Medicare identifiers in general), I think NIIP is the better region-agnostic code.  MC is a case where regional (US/AU) terminology made it into the international tables.  NIIP is really the general case of MC.</p>",

On the health system, side putting (non-national) insurance identifiers on Patient gets confusing when you deal with the different insurance type that can apply.  It looks like we don't have a code in the Identifier type value set for non-national insurance IDs, but since it is extensible... /shrug</p>",
