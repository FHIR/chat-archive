HHS is finalizing adoption of HL7 <strong>FHIR Release 4.0.1</strong> as the foundational standard for APIs at 45 CFR 170.215(a)(1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and based on that claims that, for example, the FHIR server/end-point that is built against US Core (the latest is 4.0.0 and therefore does not match FHIR 4.0.1 according to that person's view) shall support a <em>ServiceRequest</em> (which is the part of Prior Authorization Support) as well.</p>\n<p>How to explain, quoting CMS rules, that FHIR 4.0.1 is just a technical standard all other APIs are built based on?</p>",
