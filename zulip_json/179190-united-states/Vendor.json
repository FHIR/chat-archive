Emissary provides patent pending Discovery APIs, which gives access to EMR reference tables (i.e. build and configuration) for any third-party applications.</p>\n<p>and </p>\n<p>Emissary offers a set of real-time APIs in a proprietary unified data model, with greater flexibility and stability.</p>\n<p>Looks like they see themselves as a proprietary alternative to FHIR. Good luck with that.</p>",
