Are there any publicly available standards for representing MIPS measures/scores?</p>",

If you're working through some, we'd be happy to add those to the QM/DEQM IGs to make sure they are supported. Would you be willing to come to a CQI meeting (Fridays at 1:00 ET) to discuss further? If you can't make that time, I'd be happy to jump on a call and discuss. The short answer is we think QM/DEQM should support MIPS measures, and if they can't we'd like to understand why so we can support them.</p>",
