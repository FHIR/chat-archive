        "content": "<p>The US Core IG lays out a pretty clean definition of how to identify a current med list, but not much for consistency in making proposals to change the current med list.  I think the use case for a proposal to add a new medication is cut and dry,  but what about a proposed discontinuance of a medication (status=stopped + intent=proposal ?) or a proposal to modify a current medication by changing the dosage or frequency of administration (status=active + intent=proposal + same system/code for the medication ?).</p>\n<p>Our goal is to look at a set of MedicationRequests, apply the differences from anything with intent=proposal and be able to perform a side by side analysis of the current med list and the effective proposed med list to gauge the impact of the proposed changes.  Does anybody have any practical experience with how those kind of proposals are represented?</p>",
