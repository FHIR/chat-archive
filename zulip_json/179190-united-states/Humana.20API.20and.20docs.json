A few notes here.</p>\n<ol start=\"0\">\n<li>The link above has broken images, e.g., <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/NRPBds_SlXWEjGwsVHeGfiAM/image.png\">image.png</a>.  I'm seeing \"This request is not authorized to perform this operation\" when I try to fetch directly.<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/NRPBds_SlXWEjGwsVHeGfiAM/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/NRPBds_SlXWEjGwsVHeGfiAM/image.png\"></a></div></li>\n<li>Example search interactions on pages like <a href=\"https://developers.humana.com/apis/procedure-api/doc\">https://developers.humana.com/apis/procedure-api/doc</a>  show a FHIR search; the response to a search should be a <code>Bundle</code>, but the example response is a \"bare\" <code>Procedure</code> resource.</li>\n<li>Example resources show some surprising tag values like the following. There are a few issues here -- first, these seem duplicative with data already in the standard FHIR model, second these don't seem to be correct uses of the FHIR Coding data type (e.g., using a timestamp as a Code suggests you may want an extension with valueInstant instead), and for items that could be valid Codings, they're not globally unique in the way that  Coding should be (e.g., the system of \"<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html</a>\" isn't defined by HL7, and even if it did exist, patient IDs across all FHIR implementers wouldn't be globally unique in this ecosystem)</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>    &quot;meta&quot;: {\n        &quot;tag&quot;: [\n            {\n                &quot;system&quot;: &quot;https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html&quot;,\n                &quot;code&quot;: &quot;Patient/7066593375756a66586464645473673278564d554f413d3d&quot;\n            },\n            {\n                &quot;system&quot;: &quot;https://fhir.humana.com/documentation/glossary/lastRefreshedOn&quot;,\n                &quot;code&quot;: &quot;2020-12-29T08:30:24.094Z&quot;\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n</code></pre></div>",

I have our developer portal team looking into this. They are frequently making updates to the site so should be able to resolve this. </p>\n<p>Good point about the sample responses not representing the bundle (1). We did this for simplicity sake so developers could see what fields would return regardless of the way they search, but I can update these to avoid any potential confusion. I am due for an update anyway as we have added some additional fields recently!</p>\n<p>I will raise number number (2) to our developers to explore further. What you are saying makes sense. Appreciate your eye for detail!</p>\n<p>Cille</p>",
