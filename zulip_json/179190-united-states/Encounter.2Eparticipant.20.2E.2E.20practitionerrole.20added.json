Was there an HL7 Jira for this?  I would like to understand why it was added back (after it was not a choice in US Core 3.1.1, but was in 3.2.0). Perhaps <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-28375\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-28375</a> ? It references a MS Survey Results (google docs), but it does not mention encounter.</p>",

        "content": "<p>That is a publication issue in US Core v3.1.1. FHIR base Encounter.participant.individual has Reference(Practitioner | PractitionerRole | RelatedPerson). Due to the publication issue, US Core v3.1.1 only specifies MustSupport reference which cause validation error if an Encounter resource has Reference(PractitionerRole) for that element. US Core v3.2.0 actually fixed that bug. The MustSupport requirement on that element is not changed and Reference(US Core Practitioner) is still MS while reference to the other two resources are not..</p>",
