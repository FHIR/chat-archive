Per the FHIR Identifier Registry (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/identifier-registry.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/identifier-registry.html</a>), there doesn't appear to be an official URL. There appears to be an OID (from what I can tell by searching the HL7 OID Registry), but a URL would be greatly preferred. Is there a way to get an official CCN URL added to the FHIR Identifier Registry? It seems like it would fit the existing US URL pattern fairly easily (e.g., <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-ccn\">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-ccn</a>). Thanks!</p>",
