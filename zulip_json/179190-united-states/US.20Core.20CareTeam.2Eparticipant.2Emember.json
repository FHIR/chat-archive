If so, I do not believe it was the intent of the IG authors to disallow those other Resource types as references in that element, and they removed that constraint in later versions (as Lloyd pointed to).  However, that is what the profile says in v3.1.1, so validation tools may raise an error if you reference those other Resource types  in US Core v3.1.1.</p>",
