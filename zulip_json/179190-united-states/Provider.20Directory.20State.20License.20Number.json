Also, we're probably talking about close to 1000 naming systems here.  (Every state * every authoritative licensing/regulatory body for any medically affiliated practice - from acupuncture to veterinary medicine.)  I'm pretty sure the HTA doesn't want to engage with that many organizations and try to drive all of those conclusions to a logical end.  Plus, you'd end up with a completely inconsistent set of URLs - both within states and within disciplines.  I'd <em>strongly</em> advise that you just define an algorithmic basis for defining HL7-hosted sids that you can use as canonical URLs for all of the possible license numbers that could exist.  Then register all the ones that you know do exist.  The NamingSystem instances can then have descriptions that point to whatever the sponsoring organization currently is and the appropriate website for that identifier (if any).  It'll take a bit of discussion, but should be something you could get figured out in a few months.  (Best of luck to the HTA getting even 1/4 of them landed in a year - and they wouldn't be anywhere close to implementer friendly.)</p>",
