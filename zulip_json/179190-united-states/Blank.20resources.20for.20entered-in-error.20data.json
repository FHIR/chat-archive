Is there a particular type of resource that should be used in this case?<br>\nIf not, and we should instead use the specific resource type being searched/requested,  what's the expectation of the data being returned in terms of being valid for that resource? Ex. for Procedure, is it valid in the case of entered-in-error data to fill in only the ID and Status, or do all required fields (code, subject, etc.) need to be filled with a data-absent-reason such as \"masked\"?</p>",
