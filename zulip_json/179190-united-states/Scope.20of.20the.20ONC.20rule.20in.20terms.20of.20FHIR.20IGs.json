Are those to be understood as nice-to-have additional guidance on top of US Core - in terms of scope they seem to be within scope for the rule ? Other Argonaut IGs seem to be out of scope: provider Directory (STU3), scheduling, CDS Hooks, Questionnaires (based on SDC), Subscriptions (draft).<br>\nAnd: is CDS Hooks actually referenced/used in US Core ?</p>",

Groups/projects may have conflicting ideas as to what IGs one should implement to conform to the published rules. That's probably the reason as to why I'm seeing conflicting lists. </p>\n<p>Anyway, the MURAL contains the IGs that seem to be a 'SHALL implement'. I'm aware that this glosses over some of the API rules currently not covered by any IG, but for educational purposes it's ok to cover the essential parts (remember the 80%), and \"leave the remaining stuff / requirements\" to the reader. As a trainer you can get away with that, not so as an implementer ;-)</p>",
