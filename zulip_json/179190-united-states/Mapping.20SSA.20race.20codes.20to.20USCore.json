Davis</span> Regarding the mapping, I agree it seems that these CMS codes do not align with what OMB has decided is a \"Race.\" What you have is what OMB would call a combination of Race <em>and</em> Ethnicity.  Believe me when I tell you this is a loaded issue - try googling \"OMB race and ethnicity.\" There was lots of discussion on how to ask the two questions and <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/newsroom/press-kits/2018/paa/2018-paa-presentation-race-question.pdf\">for the 2020 census</a> they decided to stay with two answers, so your essentially combined set does not map well.  </p>\n<p>One solution is to build a mapping table that records either an Ethnicity if the response is #5, or a Race if it is anything else. When you record one of those profiles, you could consider creating a default instance of the other profile with something like UNK but I see that is not available in the Ethnicity value set which is surprising. I think this is worth discussing at the USRSC or Cross-WG to come up with a solution. Likely USRSC as this would be a US Core conformance issue. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191410\">@Brett Marquard</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191401\">@Eric Haas</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192672\">@Floyd Eisenberg</span></p>",
