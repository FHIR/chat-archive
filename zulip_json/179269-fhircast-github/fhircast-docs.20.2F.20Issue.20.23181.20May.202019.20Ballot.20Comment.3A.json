The overview should tell me what this thing is about.  Since this is a stand-alone document not included in FHIR, the overview should introduce the topic, as well as set the expectations for the rest of the document.  In addition, it is necessary to either define the abbreviations such as app, or include a glossary. </p>\n<hr>\n<p>_This issue was imported by @hl7-fhircast-bot from the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/fhircast-May-2019-ballot-comments\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bit.ly/fhircast-May-2019-ballot-comments\">consolidated FHIRcast May 2019 ballot spreadsheet</a>._</p>\n</blockquote>",
