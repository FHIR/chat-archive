And the app can be launched using either SMART's so-called \"EHR Launch\" or the \"Standalone launch\". </p>\n<p>I _think_ that resolved this issue.</p>\n<p>Isaac</p>\n</blockquote>",

If there are N apps in a hospital, each of them could have their own FHIRCast/FHIR Subscription w UserSession server.</p>\n<p>In a stand-alone launch call, it's less clear.  If each app has its own UserSession, then they won't talk to each other.  Talking to Isaac (Connectahon 1/27), he thinks it's implementation configuration (Seems obvious, right?)  However, I think this is a key assumption that should be called out, and leads to the problem that the different apps need to share a common UserSession: a simple solution is a SINGLE pre-defined FHIRCast server to allow stand-alone apps to share context.</p>\n<p>I think we should make this explicit for both launch types...</p>\n</blockquote>",
