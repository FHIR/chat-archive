Basically it seems irrelevant that the ID is used by the hub to identify retried notifications as that seems to be an implementation detail in the hub.  As such it seems to me that it doesn't belong in the spec.</p>\n<p>I also noticed that a couple paragraphs above, it states: \"The event identifier should be used to differentiate retried messages from user actions.\"  Is there a use case laid out in the spec (or some supporting document) that discusses this?  If not, then I think there should be; otherwise I see two options: either (1) the wording can be updated to 'may' versus 'should', or (2) it should remain an implementation detail of the hub and shouldn't be part of the spec.</p>\n</blockquote>",
