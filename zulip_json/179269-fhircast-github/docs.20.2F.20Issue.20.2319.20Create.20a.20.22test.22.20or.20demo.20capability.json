We're looking at getting it published to the web soon.</p>\n<p>Isaac</p>\n</blockquote>",

We could actually do this by suggesting implementers provide a \"test\" button or UI to allow a consuming application to test their subscription endpoint. </p>\n<p>However, a more important tool may be something closer to what CDS Hooks has: <a href=\"https://sandbox.cds-hooks.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://sandbox.cds-hooks.org/\">https://sandbox.cds-hooks.org/</a></p>\n<p>In speaking with the CDS group (@kpshek), it sounds like having that website has been one of the most important tools in helping people adopt CDS hooks. This wouldn't solve production testing use cases, but does help subscribed applications test their implementations and see what code they may need to write.</p>\n</blockquote>",
