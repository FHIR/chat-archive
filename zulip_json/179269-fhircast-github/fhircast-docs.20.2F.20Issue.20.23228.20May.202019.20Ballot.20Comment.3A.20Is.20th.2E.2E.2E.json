This will follow a similar pattern to CDS hooks.</p>\n<p>Proposed resolution: We will update how we create and define events. As for wildcarding, we expect the number of events to be relatively small so wildcards wouldn't add too much benefit. Also we prefer subscribers to explicitly state the events they want to prevent the chance of the subscribers receiving events they don't understand because the wildcard resulted in more than they expected. </p>\n<p>Would be interested in yours and everyone else's thoughts.</p>\n</blockquote>",
