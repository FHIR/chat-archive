No<br>\n- is the hub responsible for notifying client of ending of first subscription? No</p>\n<p>Need to clarify that the Hub responds as part of the intent verification with the events that a subscriber is successfully using. </p>\n<p>For websockets new subscriptions for the same topic should be on new websocket connections (we think). </p>\n</blockquote>",

The situation we were thinking of was where the client makes a subscription, but then later wants to add or change the events it is subscribed to (e.g. they subscribe to patient events, then later want to also subscribe to study events). In that case it will be the same topic and callback.</p>\n</blockquote>",
