In my mind, the hub has to resolve session assignment through some mechanism (same user id, if not  same hostname,..). <br>\nRegarding the need for the client to listen on a socket, I had a different understanding.  To me, only the application servers needs to receive notification and they would take care to notify their clients with whatever is convenient for their app.  I tried to convey that in the JS sandbox (<a href=\"https://github.com/fhircast/sandbox.js\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fhircast/sandbox.js\">https://github.com/fhircast/sandbox.js</a>).  <br>\nThat said I am interested in your proposal of websockets directly to the hub and would like to prototype something to that effect.   Could we have a chat early this week?  I’m on Frankfurt time .  Thanks, Martin </p>\n</blockquote>",

He is the engineering manager for this project and all of Powerscribe360. Over the last 15 years or so, we've both been working on radiology reporting interfaces (HL7) and desktop integrations. We currently have over a dozen different flavors including our standard XML file, our proprietary COM API, and several other vendor proprietary integrations (GE, Mckesson, Sectra, etc.). We're really hoping FHIRCast can eventually replace them all.</p>\n<p>Concerning SignalR, I don't have a strong feeling about it. I chose Websockets because it is now supported in all common browsers and web servers. I was thinking SignalR would be overkill. My Websocket implementation is incredibly simple - especially in this \"context\" (pun intended).</p>\n<p>Before going in this direction, I did pursue the idea of creating an \"application server\" as you describe @mbellehumeur. I read your post just the other day. Our product is a thick client (Windows Forms) and our application server is essentially a web service used for data access (SQL DB). There currently is no unsolicited messaging to the app. We would have to create all that, and probably do it the same way I'm doing it in our hub (via Websockets).  In my mind it just creates another layer (message router) into the equation - another point of failure. It also means that every player involved would have to implement both a FHIRCast client and a FHIRCast application server which is more work, obviously, than just the client. Not just implementation, but installation and support.</p>\n<p>That said, if Websockets aren't going to be accepted in the FHIRCast specification, then we'll have to consider falling back to that approach.</p>\n<p>I would like to connect with both of you this week prior to RSNA if possible. I can be reached best via email at <a href=\"mailto:george.kustas@nuance.com\" title=\"mailto:george.kustas@nuance.com\">george.kustas@nuance.com</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
