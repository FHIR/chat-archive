Having this information makes it possible to create a better UI experience as fields can be 'grayed out' for the clients that only 'listening' to changes in the session. It also makes it more fault tolerant as clients cannot accidently change the eg. patient in question.</p>\n</blockquote>",

You can think about it as pull requests or google docs. Some are in control of merging stuff into the session, while others are not.</p>\n<p>Each session probably has an 'originator' - which should have the capacity to elevate joiners with permission to make context changes.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I totally agree with your sentiment. Our intent was that, in most cases, the hub is the same software as the driving application. This is why an app <em>requests</em> context changes and subscribers re <em>notified</em>.</p>\n<p>I'd thought that we were explaining this in the spec, but maybe it dropped out at some point. </p>\n<p>The intent is to not require a separate context manager -- by elevating the driving application to own the user's session and therefore, potentially, dictate context changes, including by possibly rejecting context change requests from other apps. </p>\n<p>We kind of described that in the <a href=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/wiki\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/wiki\">wiki</a>, but not sufficiently.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the synchronized applications owns the user's session.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For simplicity's sake, one of the applications being synchronized must provide or integrate tightly with the authorization server, FHIR server and own the user's session by exposing it via a session management server. This application notifies subscribed applications of context changes. Subscribed applications request context changes of the session server.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based upon your asking this question, I think that we should add some additional language to the specification to explain this. </p>\n</blockquote>",
