This is not the intended model -- the common model is that the application servers are communicating and then communicating with its end-user clients in a proprietary way. This should probably be clarified in the spec.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The use of WebSub vs Websocket should be carefully considered based upon the subscribing app's architecture and the environment of the integration.</p>\n<p>### When to use WebSub over WebSockets?<br>\nWebSub is easier to troubleshoot and debug<br>\nWebSub is much less likely to encounter problems with load-balancer, rever proxies or other network appliances.   </p>\n</blockquote>",
