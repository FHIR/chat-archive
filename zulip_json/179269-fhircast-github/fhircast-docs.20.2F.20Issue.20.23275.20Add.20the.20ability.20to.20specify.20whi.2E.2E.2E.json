This may be a tab number, a window, a separate area on a screen or any other way of identifying a view.<br>\nTo resolve this, the suggestion is to specify a hub.viewId to identify the view into which this object is being opened.  The format of the viewId shall be either a simple integer starting at 0.<br>\nA single object shall not be opened more than once simultaneously without specifying a different viewId.<br>\nAny operation not specifying the hub.viewId shall have an implicit viewId of 0.</p>\n</blockquote>",
