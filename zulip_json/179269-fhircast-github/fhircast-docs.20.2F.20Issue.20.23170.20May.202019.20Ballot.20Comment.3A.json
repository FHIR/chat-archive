This id is typically the notification identifier that the subscriber receives. But in the <a href=\"https://fhircast.hl7.org/specification/May2019Ballot/#request-context-change\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://fhircast.hl7.org/specification/May2019Ballot/#request-context-change\">\"Request Context Change Request\"</a>, the subscriber is proposing a context change which has not yet occurred and, in fact, may not occur! </p>\n<p>I think that it would be better for the subscriber to not submit an id for the context change at all, and rather, (if and) once accepted, the hub should assign an id upon broadcasting the event notification to all subscribers. (This is similar to a FHIR create, in which the newly created resource id is assigned by the server, not the client). Do note that the original requestor also receives the notification request once it's enacted --</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once a requested context change is accepted, the Hub MUST broadcast the context notification to all subscribers, including the original requestor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Proposed Resolution</strong>: Persuasive with Mod<br>\nRemove the id element from the example \"Request Context Change Request\" message and clarify that the there's no id in the subscriber's request. </p>\n</blockquote>",
