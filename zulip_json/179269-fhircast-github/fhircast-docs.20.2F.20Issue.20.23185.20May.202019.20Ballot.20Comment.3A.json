Note that this optionally originated from the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#subscriber-sends-subscription-request\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#subscriber-sends-subscription-request\">WebSub spec</a>. While we're trying to preserve compatibility with WebSub, there are already places we're we've changed WebSub optionality to FHIRcast mandatory (MAY or SHOULD to SHALL; for example, <code>hub.secret</code> is mandatory in FHIRcast and optional in WebSub).</p>\n<p>If the subscriber's callback url is guessable (via a static url or known heuristic), there's a potential risk that an attacker could insert bad notifications into the subscriber. This wouldn't threaten to expose PHI, but would wreak havoc on the user's session.  The existing mechanism that protects this is the <code>hub.secret. which the subscriber provides to the Hub during the subscription request and which the Hub uses to authenticate to the </code>hub.callback` for each notification. </p>\n<p>In order to send artificial notifications to a subscriber, the attacker would not only need to know the <code>hub.callback</code> url, but also the <code>hub.secret</code>. The <code>hub.secret</code> is the actual authentication mechanism. An unguessable callback url simply provides obscurity (not security). This is likely why WebSub made this a best practice, not a requirement. </p>\n<p>Overall, I think that WebSub had it right. It's a best practice for the subscriber's callback url to be unguessable. the <code>hub.secret</code> is what secures this exchange. </p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n</blockquote>",
