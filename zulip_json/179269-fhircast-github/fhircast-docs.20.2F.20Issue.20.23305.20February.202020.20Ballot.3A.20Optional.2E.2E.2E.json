For example, add the quoted and italicized text:</p>\n<p>was received and will now be verified by the Hub. \"_Since support of both Hub channel types is not required the Hub may reject the subscription request if the requested hub.channel.type is not supported._\" If using websockets</p>\n</blockquote>",
