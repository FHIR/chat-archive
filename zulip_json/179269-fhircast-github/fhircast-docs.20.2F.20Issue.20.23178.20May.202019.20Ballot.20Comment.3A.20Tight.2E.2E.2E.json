It is important to require (SHALL be granted) the Oauth2.0.  Likewise it is important to mandate the app SHALL receiver the id_token.  </p>\n<p><strong>Existing wording:</strong> The app MUST either be launched from the driving application following the SMART on FHIR EHR launch flow or the app may initiate the launch following the SMART on FHIR standalone launch. In either case, the app MUST request and be granted the fhircast OAuth2.0 scope. Accompanying this scope grant, the authorization server MUST supply the cast-hub and hub.topic SMART launch parameters alongside the access token. These parameters identify the Hub's base url, and a unique, opaque identifier of the current user's session, respectivly. Per SMART, when scopes of openid and fhirUser are granted, the app will additionally receive the current user's identity in an id_token.<br>\n<strong>Proposed wording:</strong> The app SHALL either be launched from the driving application following the SMART on FHIR EHR launch flow or initiate the launch following the SMART on FHIR standalone launch.
