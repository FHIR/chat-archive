That would imo decrease the usage of the proposed standard, and slow down fhircast adoption. If I look at the active software in our company, I would estimate that the amount of products planning to implement Fhircast would be cut in half, due to usage of plain HL7 in existing software.</p>\n<p>I understand that for a textbook FHIR software implementation, @keithboone's suggestion might make implementation slightly easier, but it would make the non-full-FHIR implementations disproportionally harder. </p>\n</blockquote>",

This specification is clearly a CCOW replacement, yet you say little about CCOW, and use a Wikipedia cross reference instead of a reference to the HL7 CCOW Specifications when speaking of the CCOW Abstract model.
