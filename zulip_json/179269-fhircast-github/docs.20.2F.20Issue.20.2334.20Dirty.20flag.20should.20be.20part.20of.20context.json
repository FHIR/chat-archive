User changes data in the app - which should be setting a \"dirty flag\". The EMR usually displays such a status with a marker to the user.<br>\nThis would also be important because before the EMR decides to switch the context - the app get an event asking to save or discard data ...</p>\n</blockquote>",

Wouldn't he/she expect to be asked for save/discard? Since only the EMR knows about all unsaved data - it makes sense to ask for that in a central place, i.e. the EMR. Also many EMRs indicate with ui specific unsaved data.</p>\n<p>This feature targets integrating apps seamlessly..</p>\n<p>Hope this helps ..</p>\n<p>Joerg</p>\n</blockquote>",
