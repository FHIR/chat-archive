In particular, the hub.challenge is easily obtained from the URL and can be echoed from a MITM.  A POST via HTTPS would be much more secure and would more properly obfuscate the information in the request.   The Session Discovery section mentions that hub.topics are presented in the SMART on FHIR launch.  An alternative location to place these data, if GET is preferred, is the HTTP headers.</p>\n<p><strong>Existing wording:</strong>  The Hub verifies a subscription request by sending an HTTPS GET (RFC2818) request to the subscriber's callback URL as given in the subscription request.<br>\n<strong>Proposed wording:</strong>  The Hub verifies a subscription request by sending an HTTPS POST request to the subscriber's callback URL as given in the subscription request.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>_This issue was imported by @hl7-fhircast-bot from the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/fhircast-May-2019-ballot-comments\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bit.ly/fhircast-May-2019-ballot-comments\">consolidated FHIRcast May 2019 ballot spreadsheet</a>._</p>\n</blockquote>",
