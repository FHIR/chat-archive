I had to spend some time thinking through it. In WebSub (and FHIRcast!), the intent of the HMAC signature is to allow the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#signature-validation\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#signature-validation\">Hub to authenticate to the subscriber</a>. </p>\n<p>In this case, the subscriber is accessing an API on the Hub, so it's the subscriber that must authenticate. We've already got the OAuth/SMART access_token for this purpose. </p>\n<p>I can understand your goal of consistency, but I'm not sure that this is needed. What secret would we use to calculate the digest if the subscriber was supplying it to the hub? </p>\n<p>Are you okay with me merging this PR as is ?</p>\n<p>Isaac</p>\n</blockquote>",
