I'd initially had them on all the events, but changed my mind and apparently forgot to delete them from two of our events. </p>\n<p>Agree that we need to remove any reference to the <code>hub.topic</code> being a url/uri. This PR seems pretty big already and I'm trying to limit potential conflicts with other PRs. I'm hoping to fix this particular issue per section and then have an overall review at the end. </p>\n<p>Does that sounds alright?</p>\n</blockquote>",
