Therefore SMART-on-FHIR Launch is a pre-requisite specification. Synchornizing application may use event notifications to indicate whether a SMART launch context was changed during a session.  For example if the EHR is the \"driving application\" and an imaging application is \"syncrhonizing\", the user may change the encounter to view another diagnostic imaging study.
