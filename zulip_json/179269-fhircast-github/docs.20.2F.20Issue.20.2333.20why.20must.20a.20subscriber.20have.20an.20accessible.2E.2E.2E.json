This creates optionality, the enemy of interoperability, but we think that it's appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p>The bidirectional event notification requests described in #24 will remain distinct HTTP Posts (not use the web sockets communication channel). This allows the Hub to support only a single mechanism for receiving these requests, while allowing the client to potentially not have a web server. </p>\n</blockquote>",

This area needs implementer feedback and is likely to change.</p>\n<p>Draft<br>\n## WebSockets<br>\nFollowing WebSub, FHIRcast is modeled on a rest-hook interaction in which a subscribing app receives notifications over REST. Some apps may be unable to expose an outward-facing HTTP server to receive triggered notifications. For example, a pure client-side Web app or mobile app may want to receive notifications of context changes directly. This can be accomplished using a websocket notification channel.</p>\n<p>This capability is experimental, likely to change and implementer feedback is welcome. <br>\n- Client authenticates to server using a server-specified Web socket protocol (e.g. OAuth bearer token presentation).<br>\n- Client sends a bind :id message over the socket (using the logical id of the subscription). For example, the client might issue: bind 123).<br>\n- Server responds with a \"bound :id\" message to acknowledge.<br>\n- Server sends a \"ping :id\" message to notify the client each time a new result is available</p>\n</blockquote>",
