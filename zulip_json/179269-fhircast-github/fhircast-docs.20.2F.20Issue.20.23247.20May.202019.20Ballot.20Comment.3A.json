This id MUST be globally unique for the Hub, SHOULD be opaque to the subscriber and MAY be a GUID.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>_This issue was imported by @hl7-fhircast-bot from the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/fhircast-May-2019-ballot-comments\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bit.ly/fhircast-May-2019-ballot-comments\">consolidated FHIRcast May 2019 ballot spreadsheet</a>._</p>\n</blockquote>",
