I changed to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>User closed patient's medical record encounter context. A previously open and in context patient encounter is no longer open nor in context. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>to clarify that the patient's chart was necessary to close to satisfy an <code>encounter-close</code>. Is it a lot of work to move between encounters on the same patient? I'm not sure. Note that moving between encounters on the same patient isn't a typical clinical workflow, but could be typical in an back-office / audit / review / billing workflow. The work involved is generated an open and close event for each encounter navigated to...</p>\n<p>What do you think?<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

If that were the case, reviewing an earlier encounter would close and re-open the patient.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to make that clearer.  E.g., yes the user is _looking_ at a different encounter, but that's not the one in context so don't generate this message.</p>\n</blockquote>",
