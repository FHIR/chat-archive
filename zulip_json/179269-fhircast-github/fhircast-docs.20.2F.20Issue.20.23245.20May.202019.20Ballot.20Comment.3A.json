From our current <a href=\"https://fhircast.hl7.org/specification/May2019Ballot/#event-catalog\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://fhircast.hl7.org/specification/May2019Ballot/#event-catalog\">Event Catalog</a>, the human-readable event names are around 20 characters each.</td>\n<td>~30 to infinite number of characters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>hub.challenge=meu3we944ix80ox</td>\n<td>randomly generated secret</td>\n<td>~30 characters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>hub.lease_seconds=604800</td>\n<td>Number of seconds in a week</td>\n<td>24</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So, the verification of a simple subscription to a single event has a querystring length of ~130 characters. Each additional event adds around 20 characters. If we adhere to the defaulted IIS querystring length of 2048, this would leave 1918 characters for additional events. Based on our expected event name length of 20 characters, this would allow another ~96 events. </p>\n<p>That seems like a lot. We currently have 7 events defined, and are likely dropping two of those events as part of the ballot. </p>\n<p>Phil, I agree with your sentiment and design philosophy. If we weren't basing FHIRcast on the published WebSub spec, this would be a slam dunk. I don't think that the two concerns:<br>\n1) HTTP GET querystring length is limited to 2048 characters<br>\n2) Url-encoding inevitably causes implementers problems<br>\nare sufficient justification for breaking compatibility with WebSub. Further, WebSub does provide a rationale for their non-RESTful use of HTTP methods:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE<br>\nThe spec uses GET vs POST to differentiate between the confirmation/denial of the subscription request and delivering the content. While this is not considered \"best practice\" from a web architecture perspective, it does make implementation of the callback URL simpler. Since the POST body of the content distribution request may be any arbitrary content type and only includes the actual content of the document, using the GET vs POST distinction to switch between handling these two modes makes implementations simpler.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the discussion in the <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/websub/issues/28\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/w3c/websub/issues/28\">w3c/websub issue #28</a> elaborates on this design decision (as Leo points out). </p>\n<p>@certel, my impression is that you are unlikely to ever implement FHIRcast and are simply providing helpful advice based upon your experience with Websub. I'd encourage you to continue to give this feedback directly to Websub. </p>\n<p><strong>Proposed resolution:</strong> Persuasive with Mod<br>\n<strong>Proposed resolution comments:</strong> We should probably steal WebSub's note explaining our non-RESTful handling of HTTP methods.</p>\n</blockquote>",
