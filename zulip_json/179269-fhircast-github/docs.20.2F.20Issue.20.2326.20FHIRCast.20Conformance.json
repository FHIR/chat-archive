For one that would mean, how the events look (content) and also which events are available (capabilities). We discussed Swagger (<a href=\"https://swagger.io/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://swagger.io/\">https://swagger.io/</a>) for this. </p>\n<p>An open question is if the FHIR-Definitions would be any use for this -&gt; Ex. Parameters Resource as definition what information the events contain.</p>\n</blockquote>",
