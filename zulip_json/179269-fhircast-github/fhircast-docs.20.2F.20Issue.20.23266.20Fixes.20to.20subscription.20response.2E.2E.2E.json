Two questions/suggestions:</p>\n<p>1) You're committing just the images of the diagrams, not the source materials, such that editing them would require re-creating them. Can you also commit the source (for example, if you were using <a href=\"http://websequencediagrams.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://websequencediagrams.com\">websequencediagrams.com</a>, the textual representation of the diagram in a text file). </p>\n<p>2) Your denial diagram strongly implies that a denial will only and ever immediately follow a subscription request. Our spec, as well as the WebSub spec are clear that a denial may occur at any time, even after having successfully sent notifications. What do you think about updating the diagram's text callout, to something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>App subscribes to hub. Hub denies subscription. <strong>This denial may occur at any time, even after a successful intent verification or event notifications.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>",
