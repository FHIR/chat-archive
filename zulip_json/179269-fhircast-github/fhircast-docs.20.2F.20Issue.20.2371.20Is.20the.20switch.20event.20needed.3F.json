The list of events was informed by current state integrations. I agree with everything you say, above. </p>\n<p>In production, applications and clinical workflow can:<br>\n1) Only ever have a single patient's record open at a time. <br>\n2) Support having multiple patients \"open\", but only ever one in focus.<br>\n3) Support having multiple patients in focus.<br>\n4) Support having no patients in focus. </p>\n<p>For scenario (2), how can we enable synchronization between two apps which are both capable of having multiple patients \"open\", but only ever one in focus?</p>\n<p>For scenario (4), how can we enable synchronization where the one app has multiple patients \"open\", but the user moves to an activity with no patients in focus?</p>\n<p>We could:<br>\n1) Drop the switch events now.<br>\n2) Move the event catalog out of the spec, so that it can mature indepdently.<br>\n3) Figure this out during the May connectathon and ballot resolution.</p>\n<p><em>Would you be willing to submit this as a ballot comment?</em></p>\n<p>Isaac</p>\n</blockquote>",

I understand that a patient/study can be open. Zero, one or more patients/studies can be in focus.<br>\nMaybe we should have the following events:<br>\n   open-patient/open-study<br>\n   close-patient/close-study<br>\n   focus-change : lists the current patient/studies in focus.<br>\nThe reason for the last event to be separate is that we can signal both states separately. The reason for providing a focus list instead of individual events is that it forces application to consider that fact that there can be more than one patient in focus.<br>\nAny thoughts?</p>\n</blockquote>",
