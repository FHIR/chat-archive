Although the FHIRcast specification itself is independent of any given version of FHIR, the examples in the specification should either be multi-version or kept reasonably up to date. Since we're looking at balloting next year, r4 will be the most recently released version of FHIR. </p>\n<p>Of particular note is that r4's ImagingStudy resource removed the <code>uid</code> and <code>accession</code> elements by collapsing that information into the <code>identifier</code> element.</p>\n<p>Isaac</p>\n<p>Credit to @gkustas and @ElliotSilver for questioning/pointing this out in issue #46 and <a href=\"#narrow/stream/117-fhircast-github/subject/docs.20.2F.20Issue.20.2346.20Proper.20json.20for.20imaging-study.20with.20regar.2E.2E.2E\" title=\"#narrow/stream/117-fhircast-github/subject/docs.20.2F.20Issue.20.2346.20Proper.20json.20for.20imaging-study.20with.20regar.2E.2E.2E\">zulip</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
