This would allow for the use case of an 'app framework' which can control the launching of the EMR as 'just another peer' in the 'shared context', and not as the 'master' of the context.   [Not sure of the technical issues around OAuth 2.0 tokens, but the CCOW standard had a concept called 'chain of trust' so that all the peers participating in the shared context trusted each other by some 'out-of-band' pre-arrangement of trust.]</p>\n</blockquote>",
