This would be extremely useful in the case of unidirectional integration syncing. For example a subscribing app receives the notifications for an open study and puts that in focus. They are not implementing bi-directional syncing and the user then opens a different study in the subscribing application. The driving application then closes the original study. The current spec would dictate that the subscribing app close the current study or both studies, either of which I don't think is necessarily what we want. If they only close the in focus study (study B) then the original study is still open in the subscribing application even though it was closed in the driving application which seems clearly wrong. If they close both then that could annoy the user who wanted to keep in focus that manually opened study. </p>\n<p>This has caused some issues with current integrations where some systems don't pay attention to the context of the close and will instead just close everything or the current thing which can cause some weird behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>",
