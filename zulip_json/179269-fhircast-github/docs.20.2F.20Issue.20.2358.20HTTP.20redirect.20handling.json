The subscriber is responsible for protecting its bearer token and it should not share it with any third-party. </p>\n<p>Further, the subscriber was explicitly told which endpoint (<code>hub.topic</code> url) at which to initiate a subscription. Note that this is the case both in WebSub and FHIRcast. WebSub includes support for redirects, not to solve the \"trailing slash\" problem, but rather to federate Hubs. </p>\n<p>Why shouldn't the subscriber always expect the <code>hub.topic</code> url that it receives in the SMART app launch to always be correct (including the appropriate presence or absence of a trailing slash as required)?</p>\n<p>Isaac</p>\n</blockquote>",
