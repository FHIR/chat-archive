While the imaging study (exam) is an integral resource, the report encapsulates one or more of these studies. Also, the diagnostic report contains certain attributes (such as report status), that are useful to the PACS/RIS applications and don't exist in the imaging study. Structured data, usually in the form of an Observation resource can also be encapsulated in the report.</p>\n<p>I propose we consider adding DiagnosticReport-Open, DiagnosticReport-Update, and DiagnosticReport-Close events. Including [immature] samples below:</p>\n<p>Example 1. new report requested by PACS/RIS, including priors.<br>\n ```json<br>\n{<br>\n  \"timestamp\": \"2019-09-10T14:58:45.988Z\",<br>\n  \"id\": \"0d4c9998\",<br>\n  \"event\": {<br>\n    \"hub.topic\": \"DrXRay\",<br>\n    \"hub.event\": \"DiagnosticReport-open\",<br>\n    \"context\": [<br>\n      {<br>\n        \"key\": \"Report\",<br>\n        \"resource\": {<br>\n          \"resourceType\": \"DiagnosticReport\",<br>\n          \"identifier\": \"40012366\",<br>\n          \"status\": \"unknown\",<br>\n          \"code\": \"18748-4\",<br>\n          \"imagingStudy\": [<br>\n            {<br>\n              \"reference\": \"ImagingStudy/342123458\"<br>\n            },<br>\n            {<br>\n              \"reference\": \"ImagingStudy/1462123458\"<br>\n            }<br>\n          ]<br>\n        }<br>\n      },<br>\n      {<br>\n        \"key\": \"PriorStudy\",<br>\n        \"resource\": {<br>\n          \"resourceType\": \"ImagingStudy\",<br>\n          \"description\": \"CHEST XRAY\",<br>\n          \"started\": \"2010-01-30T23:00:00.000Z\",<br>\n          \"identifier\": [<br>\n            {<br>\n              \"type\": {<br>\n                \"coding\": [<br>\n                  {<br>\n                    \"system\": \"<a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203\">http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203</a>\",<br>\n                    \"code\": \"ACSN\"<br>\n                  }<br>\n                ],<br>\n                \"value\": \"342123458\"<br>\n              }<br>\n            }<br>\n          ]<br>\n        }<br>\n      },<br>\n      {<br>\n        \"key\": \"Study\",<br>\n        \"resource\": {<br>\n          \"resourceType\": \"ImagingStudy\",<br>\n          \"description\": \"CHEST XRAY\",<br>\n          \"started\": \"2019-08-30T23:00:00.000Z\",<br>\n          \"identifier\": [<br>\n            {<br>\n              \"type\": {<br>\n                \"coding\": [<br>\n                  {<br>\n                    \"system\": \"<a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203\">http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203</a>\",<br>\n                    \"code\": \"ACSN\"<br>\n                  }<br>\n                ],<br>\n                \"value\": \"1462123458\"<br>\n              }<br>\n            }<br>\n          ]<br>\n        }<br>\n      }<br>\n    ]<br>\n  }<br>\n}</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>Example 2. existing report signed and closed in reporting application\n\n```json\n{\n    &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;2019-09-10T14:58:45.988Z&quot;,\n    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;0d4c9998&quot;,\n    &quot;event&quot;: {\n        &quot;hub.topic&quot;: &quot;DrXRay&quot;,\n        &quot;hub.event&quot;: &quot;DiagnosticReport-close&quot;,\n        &quot;context&quot;: [\n            {\n                &quot;key&quot;: &quot;Report&quot;,\n                &quot;resource&quot;: {\n                    &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;DiagnosticReport&quot;,\n                    &quot;identifier&quot;: &quot;40012366&quot;,\n                    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;final&quot;,\n                    &quot;issued&quot; : &quot;2019-09-13T14:58:45&quot;,\n                    &quot;code&quot;: &quot;18748-4&quot;,\n                    &quot;ImagingStudy&quot;: [\n                        {\n                            &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;ImagingStudy/alskdjfhe8lasd&quot;\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                &quot;key&quot;: &quot;Study&quot;,\n                &quot;resource&quot;: {\n                    &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;ImagingStudy&quot;,\n                    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;CHEST XRAY&quot;,\n                    &quot;started&quot;: &quot;2019-08-30T23:00:00.000Z&quot;,\n                    &quot;id&quot; : &quot;alskdjfhe8lasd&quot;,\n                    &quot;identifier&quot;: [\n                        {\n                            &quot;type&quot;: {\n                                &quot;coding&quot;: [\n                                    {\n                                        &quot;system&quot;: &quot;http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203&quot;,\n                                        &quot;code&quot;: &quot;ACSN&quot;\n                                    }\n                                ],\n                                &quot;value&quot;: &quot;1462123458&quot;\n                            }\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n</pre></div>\n\n\n</blockquote>",

That way we can include more than one prior.<br>\nI'd also like to suggest that this be called \"relevant\" rather than \"prior\" as it actually is a reference to relevant documents, and not JUST studies.  For example,  the \"relevant\" list might include:<br>\nCondition - \"Brain Cancer\"<br>\nServiceRequest - CT of the brain requested due to Observation<br>\nObservation - patient is experiencing numbness in legs<br>\nImagingStudy - images from last CT  showing tentative remission<br>\nImagingStudy - images from initial CT show initial cancer diagnosis<br>\nNote these would all be short resource references rather than complete objects.  The receiving system is expected to be able to look them up.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Right now we're thinking that including the ImagingStudy encounter - with start and end times - will be enough for the subscriber to know if the ImagingStudy is current or relevant. Assuming relevant studies have already ended of course. </p>\n</blockquote>",

Can you always provide the ImagingStudy resources from a Reporting application? (If not, it is hard for the hub to identify the \"full context\", including Patient, ImagingStudy and DiagnosticReport. The hub would need this information for content sharing, see #291 in order to decide which _context_ the _content_ belongs to).</li>\n<li>(Minor) I guess the 'identifier' of DiagnosticReport in Example 1 is actually 'id', right?</li>\n<li>Why is the Patient missing from the context array (it is required for other '-Open' events)? More generally: should we always require the full graph of context objects to avoid ambiguity (in this example we would need Patient, ImagingStudy and DiagnosticReport) or can we assume some hierarchy already (in this example we would assume that the ImagingStudy is linked to a Patient already known by all applications taking part in the synchronization, hence the Patient information might be considered redundant)?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>",
