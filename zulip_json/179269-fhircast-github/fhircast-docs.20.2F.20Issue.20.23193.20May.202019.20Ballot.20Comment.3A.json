This is business logic of the Hub &amp; driving application. Any number of security-related reasons could cause a Hub to deny a subscription. The Hub could determine that the <code>hub.topic</code> isn't valid or even that the subscriber is required <code>hub.events</code> not supported by the Hub or that the subscriber isn't authorized to join the particular user's session or .... </p>\n<p>Does that help?</p>\n</blockquote>",

This is business logic of the Hub &amp; driving application. Any number of security-related reasons could cause a Hub to deny a subscription. The Hub could determine that the <code>hub.topic</code> isn't valid or even that the subscriber's required <code>hub.events</code> are not supported by the Hub or that the subscriber isn't authorized to join the particular user's session or .... </p>\n<p>Does that help?</p>\n</blockquote>",
