There needs to be a unique identifier (as the hub.callback is required to be, and is used by the current RESTful sandbox implementations).</p>\n<p>Should we use the hub.callback and create a unique url for identification purposes? It could be generated using the client's IP address and port in order to keep it unique?</p>\n</blockquote>",
