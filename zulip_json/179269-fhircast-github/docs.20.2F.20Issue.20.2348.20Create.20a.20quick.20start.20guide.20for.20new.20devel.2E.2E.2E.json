        "content": "<p>Hi, you are welcomed to reuse any visual or text from the JS sandbox readme.  <br>\nFor the flowchart, I would simplify by removing the EHR. In radiology reporting, I would say that EHR is part of the desktop workflow only about 20% of the time. For imaging folks, having EHR at the start and end of the desktop workflow is just not part of our reality (perhaps not the right forum to point this outâ€¦).   I think this ties in to some confusion people may have between CDS hooks and FHIRcast.  If we are going to see FHIRcast in use in the near future, it cannot be so tightly bound to the EHR.</p>",
