We should consider sacrificing full conformance to websub and change these to \"hub_topic\" , \"hubTopic\" or just \"topic\".<br>\nI checked and have not found any variables with dots in the name in the FHIR standard.  Maybe there is already a rule for naming attributes that could superseed websub.</p>\n</blockquote>",
