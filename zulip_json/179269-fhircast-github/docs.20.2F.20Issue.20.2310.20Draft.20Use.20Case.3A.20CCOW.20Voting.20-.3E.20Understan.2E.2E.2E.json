The subscriber's callback URL MAY return an HTTP 410 code to indicate that the subscription has been deleted, and the hub MAY terminate the subscription if it receives that code as a response</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So even though it is technically possible and in some contexts useful - it would violate the underlying spec.</p>\n</blockquote>",
