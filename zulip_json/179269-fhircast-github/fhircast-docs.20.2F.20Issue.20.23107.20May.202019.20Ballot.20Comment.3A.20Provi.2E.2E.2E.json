Except for the \"meta\" sync-error event, we will move the Event Catalog out of the specification. sync-error will be renamed to syncerror. Per other comments, we will also define a process for the publishing of new events within the Event Catalog.</p>\n<p>FHIRcast events are an extensible syntax based upon FHIR resources, following the SMART on FHIR scope syntax.</p>\n<p>Expressed in EBNF notation, the FHIRcast syntax for workflow related events is:</p>\n<p>hub.events ::= ( fhir-resource ) '-' ( 'open' | 'close' )<br>\nimage</p>\n<p>The event notification or request for context change message SHALL be accompanied by the fhir-resource named in the hub.events. Further, the Event Catalog may define additional resources to be included within the event.</p>\n<p>Disposition: <br>\nDisposition Comment:</p>\n<p><span aria-label=\"+1\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f44d\" role=\"img\" title=\"+1\">:+1:</span> For: 14<br>\n<span aria-label=\"expressionless\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f611\" role=\"img\" title=\"expressionless\">:expressionless:</span> Abstain: 0<br>\n<span aria-label=\"-1\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f44e\" role=\"img\" title=\"-1\">:-1:</span> Against: 0</p>\n<p><span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span> The motion passed! <span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span></p>\n<p>svg generated from railroad diagrams<br>\nrelevant to: #128, ...</p>\n</blockquote>",
