In the case where the subscriber's http response shows an error maybe this would be possible, but if they respond with a 202 then send the Hub a sync error after, then there would be no way for the Hub to delay meaning all subscribers would receive the original notification. That feels fine to me, as long as the Hub additionally sends the sync error, but I think both cases should be consistent. Either we send the notification and a sync error or we don't send the notification (I am leaning towards the former).</p>\n</blockquote>",
