We only seem to store the png of the diagrams and have a link as well, but that will make it difficult to update. We will need to find and update the editable version then export it as a png and recommit that as well.  What is your plan for those? We are both using drawio so whatever you end deciding to do here is probably what I will do for mine.</p>\n<p>-Will</p>\n</blockquote>",

For the diagrams on the <a href=\"https://fhircast.org/security-considerations/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://fhircast.org/security-considerations/\">Security Considerations page</a>, I'm including a link to the publically-accessible image and raw diagram via google drive to <a href=\"http://draw.io\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://draw.io\">draw.io</a>. For example, the fhircast page includes this text:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The below <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pdG6Kw4pAG53J9d7_rK98DSvm_GMiCC/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pdG6Kw4pAG53J9d7_rK98DSvm_GMiCC/view?usp=sharing\">flow diagram</a> illustrates each of the interactions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This isn't perfect, but it would enable a new editor to copy the existing diagram instead of re-creating it. </p>\n<p>What do you think?</p>\n</blockquote>",
