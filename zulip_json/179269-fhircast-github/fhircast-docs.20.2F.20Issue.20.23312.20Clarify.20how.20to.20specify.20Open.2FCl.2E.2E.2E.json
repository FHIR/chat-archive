For example, we have Client 1 on the left monitor deciding to display Patient A.  They might request Client2 on the right monitor to display a report.   This might be indicated in Client 1 via highlighting on the report button, and then sending a Report-Open event over fhircast.  The second client then looks at it and starts fetching the new report, displaying the old one until the new one is available.  Maybe this takes many seconds, and the user then looks at the old one, says that there is no problem with Patient B (the previous patient), and closes the applications before realizing that they were looking at a mismatched report.<br>\nI'd like to suggest that there is a way to differentiate \"request\" from  \"performed\" notifications.<br>\nThere is the existing error handling, and that is useful to get notifications of real errors, but it would be useful to have a more positive mechanism such that:<br>\nCLient 1 - clicks on \"display report\" button, sends \"Report-Open\" - with a request option on it<br>\nClient 2 - receives Report-Open request, displays report and replies with Report-Open Performed.<br>\nClient 1 - receives Report-Open performed and updates the display showing it is actually in sync.</p>\n</blockquote>",
