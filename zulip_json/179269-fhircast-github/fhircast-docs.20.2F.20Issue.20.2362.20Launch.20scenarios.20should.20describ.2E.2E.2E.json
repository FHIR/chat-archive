In practice, the install base for RIS, PACS, dictation systems, etc which currently use a context synchronization mechanism in production may not support SMART launches. </p>\n<p>We should update the informative <a href=\"http://fhircast.org/launch-scenarios/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhircast.org/launch-scenarios/\">Launch Scenarios</a> page to better describe and recommend launch scenarios and \"session discovery\" not only the existing SMART flows, but also:<br>\n1. non-OAuth app launches<br>\n2. session discovery without an app launch process.</p>\n<p>Very related to @jeremyricharson's #4 .</p>\n</blockquote>",
