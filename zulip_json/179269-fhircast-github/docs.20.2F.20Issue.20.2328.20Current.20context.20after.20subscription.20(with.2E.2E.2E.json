A subscriber may perform this query immediately upon launching. Event-driven context notifications should take precedence.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>GET https://hub.example.com/7jaa86kgdudewiaq0wtu\nHost: hub\nAuthorization: Bearer i8hweunweunweofiwweoijewiwe\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>{\n  &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;2018-01-08T01:40:05.14&quot;,\n  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;wYXStHqxFQyHFELh&quot;,\n  &quot;event&quot;: {\n    &quot;hub.topic&quot;: &quot;https://hub.example.com/7jaa86kgdudewiaq0wtu&quot;,\n    &quot;context&quot;: [\n      {\n        &quot;key&quot;: &quot;patient&quot;,\n        &quot;resource&quot;: {\n          &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;Patient&quot;,\n          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;798E4MyMcpCWHab9&quot;,\n          &quot;identifier&quot;: [\n            {\n              &quot;system&quot;: &quot;urn:oid:1.2.840.114350&quot;,\n              &quot;value&quot;: &quot;1345687&quot;\n            },\n            {\n              &quot;system&quot;: &quot;urn:oid:1.2.840.114350.1.13.861.1.7.5.737384.27000&quot;,\n              &quot;value&quot;: &quot;7539&quot;\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n</pre></div>\n\n\n</blockquote>",
