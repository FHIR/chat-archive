My experience with both Trifolia and Forge is that they cover 95-98% of what you need really well, but there's always a 2-5% that you either need or would be super-helpful that they can't do yet.  I suspect FSH will end up in that same bucket, but as an open source project, it's easier/faster to get the bit you're missing in</p>",
