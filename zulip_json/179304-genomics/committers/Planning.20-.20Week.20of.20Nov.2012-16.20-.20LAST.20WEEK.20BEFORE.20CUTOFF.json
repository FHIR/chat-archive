I suggest we defer it. We have definitions for each element in the SDs, but they need to be more robust and unambiguous. Each SD should have a paragraph describing what it is and how it's used. eg. <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/obs-haplotype.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/obs-haplotype.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/obs-haplotype.html</a> doesn't have anything describing haplotype. I think the CG group should have a glossary that's agnostic to the standard, so perhaps should be separate from IG but pointed to by the IG? Maybe developed by IM? Each term could be pointing to SO, or VMC, or some external definition when appropriate, with added considerations for CG, and the IG would describe considerations for FHIR . Maybe it starts out as part the IG, eg a separate artifact/static page, just labeled 'glossary', and later de-couple it from FHIR. But at this stage, maybe we can create a page with some of these comments on it and looking for input.</p>",
