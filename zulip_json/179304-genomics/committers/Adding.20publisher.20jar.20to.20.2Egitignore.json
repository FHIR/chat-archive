When I as pushing up a change, git told me it was &gt; 100 MB and that we wouldn't be able to get to our repo if I committed it.  So, going forward, when you download, probably should always always run '_genUpdatePublisher' script the first time you do a build (which honestly was a good idea anyway)</p>",
