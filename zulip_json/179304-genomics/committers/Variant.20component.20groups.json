Here Haplotype allows each underlying site-specific locus to have a variant profile, with the Star Allele appearing as the Haplotype. To me this would be similar to HLA Allele. But I see the desire to simplify as one could think about ISCN strings similarly. </p>\n<p>So, that would bring up what to do with a complex HGVS that involves multiple, discrete, loci. Perhaps leave both options available? That would, of course, mean that implementers need to look at genotypes, haplotypes and variant observations to find the Allele. It is a tough call. I lean towards not having alleles as Variant observations but in a higher level construct, but it would be technically doable to use the Variant observation. If we're not in a position to dictate one (use of Haplotype and Genotype for alleles) over the other (using GL-strings, complex HGVS strings in Variant), then maybe the community could be given both and use in practice will dictate?</p>",
