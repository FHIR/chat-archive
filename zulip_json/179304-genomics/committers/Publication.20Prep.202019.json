Thinking about it, the main problem I see is that a PGx recommendation based on the Tumor's genetics (often called somatic) is different than a PGx recommendation based on the patient's germline genetics. Having the two profiles keeps the distinction, but it is an artificial means. When you look at the structures in FHIR do you see a way that one can indicate that the PGx recommendation is based on somatic sequencing AND that the target of the recommendation is Tumor response to treatment? am I drawing too much of line between patient and tumor? E.g. when I think about treating an organ like the heart. I have treatments which act on cardiac muscles and could have genetic variants that speak to predicted efficacy. And I also could have variants that speak to the ability of the patient to produce the active compound for a treatment. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"195180\">@Alexander Mankovich</span> sorry to ask you for a definitive, but what do you think? do you see a need for a computer system to make a distinction for medications intended to treat Cancer Tumors? If so, should we also push for medications that have a drug target on a specific cell type as somatic PGx too? I am so turned around that I can see through the back of my head. Help : ^ )</p>",
