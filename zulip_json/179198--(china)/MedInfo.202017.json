Like Grahame, I will do whatever you guys want me to do, but one option to consider is a 1 day seminar that I've been working on for people new to FHIR - especially clinicians and analysts, but also suits techies. Combines presentations and exercises for the attendee using the clinFHIR tooling that we've been working on, and seems quite well received on the occasions I've given it. Can make it shorter if needed, though will obviously need to cut stuff out if I do that)</p>",
