Another option is to edit your api, a source of inspiration can be the <a href=\"https://github.com/fhirbase/fhirbase/blob/master/web.go\">web.go</a> api inside fhirbase.</p>\n<p>Edit:<br>\nThen you can implement a custom <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/operationslist.html\">RESTful API Operation </a></p>",
