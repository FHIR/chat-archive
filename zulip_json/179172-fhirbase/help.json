Actually, my case is more related to the mapping between the different FHIR resources and the relational tables, not the tool that I would use to load the data.

According to Lloyd, there does not seem to be anything like this, it seems that it depends on the specific information that one wants to have in the DW. Anyway thanks guys again.</p>",
