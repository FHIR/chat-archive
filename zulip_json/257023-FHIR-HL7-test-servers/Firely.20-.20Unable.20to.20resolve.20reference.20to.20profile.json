I have been following <a href=\"https://docs.fire.ly/projects/Firely-Server/en/latest/features/validation.html#validate-on-the-resourcetype-level\">Firely documentation</a> for validation and trying the validation on a system and ResourceType level. However I get the error <code>Unable to resolve reference to profile 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient'</code>. To reference the us-core-patient I either put the canonical url in the endpoint like so<br>\n<code>https://server.fire.ly/Patient/$validate?profile=http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient</code><br>\nor put it in the meta field for the resource</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>    &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;Patient&quot;,\n    &quot;meta&quot;: {\n        &quot;profile&quot;: [\n            &quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient&quot;\n        ]\n    },\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I managed to get the validation working using the FHIR validator jar [FHIR Validation tool Version 5.4.4 (Git# 952db0248a25)] for the Patient resource.<br>\nWhat might be the issue, such as if its an issue with the Firely server or the resource input.<br>\nAdditionally, another situation when validating a bundle using the Firely server I receive no errors, but the FHIR validator jar returns errors such as <code>Bundle entry missing fullUrl</code> or <code>Except for transactions and batches, each entry in a Bundle must have a fullUrl which is the identity of the resource in the entry</code>; what could account for these differences?</p>",
