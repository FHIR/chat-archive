As per FHIR spec, it should return a batch-response type bundle, having first entry as operational outcome and 2nd entry as 201 created. To surprise, it is returning operational outcome as a single response. Request and response attached. Any insights would be appreciated.</p>\n<p>HAPI server also shares the same behavior.  I wonder if my understanding is somewhere incorrect.</p>\n<p>I'm sending an invalid Patient.gender. As per spec, it should fail at Patient resource validation level rather than Bundle level.<br>\nRequest and response attached.<br>\nrequest.json response.json</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",
