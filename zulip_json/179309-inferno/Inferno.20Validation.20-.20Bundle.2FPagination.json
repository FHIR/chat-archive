We don't need to have a minimum mandatory number of pagination for inferno test to pass...!!!<br>\nThis is our understanding, please correct if we have different understanding of it.</p>\n<p>Also, if the records are more then Inferno will cap those to first 20 bundles of data into consideration, rest of them will be ignored.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",
