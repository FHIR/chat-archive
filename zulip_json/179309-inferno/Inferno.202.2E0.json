We are working on updating our language throughout our repos / sites to better explain the changes.  Bottom line is that v1.9 -&gt; v2.0 represents a major update to the technical foundation of these certification tests. While the test changes themselves are intended to be minimal, so much else is changing in v2.0 (including the name) that we will continue to support v1.9 for the near future.  You can still use Inferno Program Edition v1.9 at the same URL as before, and besides the fact that we reset the stored test data on the site this weekend everything else should be identical.</p>",

See below and thank you!</p>\n<p><strong>What is in the new release of Inferno?</strong></p>\n<p>This new release of Inferno is called the âInferno Frameworkâ and includes an upgrade of the overall platform which will allow ONC to better support standards conformance testing and development by supporting multiple versions of standards in tests to accommodate the <a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/topic/standards-version-advancement-process-svap\">Standards Version Advancement Process</a>. It also includes new features, like a JSON API to help with tool integration, and a revised user interface to accommodate a variety of standards conformance testing use cases such as HL7 FHIR and supporting standards. ONC updated Inferno to make it easier for the health IT community to develop tests using the Inferno Framework without needing to directly engage with ONC. <a href=\"https://inferno-framework.github.io/inferno-core/\">Learn more</a> about the Inferno Framework and its features including Inferno Core, and Test Kits.</p>\n<p>Included in the Inferno Framework is the <a href=\"https://inferno.healthit.gov/onc-certification-g10-test-kit\">(g)(10) Standardized API Test Kit</a>, which supports testing for the Â§ 170.315(g)(10) certification criterion adopted as part of the ONC Health IT Certification Program. ONC took special care to ensure that the test scenarios and tests in this new release are the same as the previous Inferno Program Edition (Release 1.9). </p>\n<p><strong>When was Inferno Framework released?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/healthit-certification/inferno-redesigned-easier-faster-extensible\">ONC announced</a> the release of Inferno Framework including the (g)(10) Standardized API Test Kit on March 8, 2022. To support this release, ONC will continue to host the previous Inferno Program Edition (Release 1.9) on <a href=\"https://inferno.healthit.gov/inferno\">inferno.healthit.gov/inferno</a> for approximately two months. ONC recommends Authorized Test Labs (ATLs) and developers continue to support Certification testing via the previous Inferno Program Edition (Release 1.9) for at least one month to help with the transition. </p>\n<p>To support the health IT community with the rollout of Inferno Framework, ONC will host a month of health IT developer Inferno office hours, where ONC will review the Inferno Framework and (g)(10) Standardized API Test Kit releases on 3/18, 3/25, 4/1 and 4/8 from 2:00 pm â 3:00 pm ET.

ONC will continue hosting Inferno Program Edition (Release 1.9.0) at <a href=\"https://inferno.healthit.gov/inferno\">inferno.healthit.gov/inferno</a> for approximately two months. All future enhancements for certification testing for the (g)(10) criterion will be made in the (g)(10) Standardized API Test Kit. We encourage health IT developers to begin using (g)(10) Standardized API Test Kit and provide any feedback on the <a href=\"https://github.com/onc-healthit/onc-certification-g10-test-kit\">(g)(10) Standardized API Test Kit GitHub page</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Are the tests the same in previous Inferno Program Edition (Release 1.9.0) and the new (g)(10) Standardized API Test Kit in Inferno Framework?</strong></p>\n<p>Basically, yes. ONC took special care to ensure that the test scenarios and tests in this new release are the same as the previous Inferno Program Edition (Release 1.9). However, there may be small changes in test results for systems between the versions. The <a href=\"https://github.com/onc-healthit/onc-certification-g10-test-kit/releases/tag/v2.0.0\">release notes for the (g)(10) Standardized API Test Kit on GitHub</a> provide an overview of the updates in (g)(10) Standardized API Test Kit. Please report any discrepancies in <a href=\"https://github.com/onc-healthit/onc-certification-g10-test-kit/issues\">GitHub Issues section of the (g)(10) Standardized API Test Kit repository</a> so that they can be documented and fixed if necessary.

I would say if the issue is related to g10 test, raise the issue in g10-test repo though the root cause may lays on somewhere else, ex Device resource failed with validator error. If the issue is not related to g10 test and more fundamentally affect other test kit, then raise it in corresponding repo, ex add logging for validation request. The reason is that we have all the tracking build in g10 repo. Any status change on an issue is reflected with label changes, such as \"will fix\", \"resolved\", \"release in v2.0\" etc. So it is easier for issue report to know the expectation. Also it is easier for us to estimate how many issues need to be addressed and prioritize g10 issues.</p>",
