USCLRO-01 will return two resources (due to our test data), one without the code.coding.code attribute and one with it. USCLRO-01 skips the resource without the attribute (successfully) but the USCLRO-02 test does not skip the resource without the attribute and instead fails. We would like to confirm that this isn't the expected behavior of Inferno tests.</p>",
