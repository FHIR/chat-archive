Skipped resources are DiagnosticReport For Report And Note Exchange Tests, DiagnosticReport For Laboratory Results Reporting Tests, DocumentReference Tests, MedicationRequest Tests, Provenance Tests. </p>\n<p>One of the message for Medication request is \"Could not find the following resource type references:reported:Patient,Practitioner,Organization;requester:Organization,Patient,Device\". This was not happening last week. Could you please give us some guidance on why this is happening? </p>\n<p>Here is the saved link for reference server tests. <a href=\"https://inferno.healthit.gov/inferno/hi3OHZ7ODYJ/\">https://inferno.healthit.gov/inferno/hi3OHZ7ODYJ/</a></p>\n<p>Thank You</p>",
