This is an unfortunate side-effect of the SSL certificate expiration issues from a few weeks ago. There is a workaround that you can use until we're able to fix the underlying issue. If you're using Inferno from the GitHub repository, you can edit the <code>config.yml</code> file that's at the root of the Inferno installation to set <code>disable_verify_peer</code> to <code>true</code> (by default it should be <code>false</code>). This will let you download the required terminology files. We highly recommmend resetting that variable to <code>false</code> before running any tests with Inferno.</p>",
