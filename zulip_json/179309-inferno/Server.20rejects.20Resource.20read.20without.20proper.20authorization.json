I didn't understand the reason behind this request. Can someone please shed some light into this case.<br>\nTest Scenario: <br>\nPatient Resource: <br>\nTest Step: ARPA-01: Server rejects patient read without proper authorization<br>\nResult : Http Status Code 415. <br>\nURL Request: GET <a href=\"https://fhirServerURL/connect/authorize?client_id=XXXX\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://fhirServerURL/connect/authorize?client_id=XXXX\">https://fhirServerURL/connect/authorize?client_id=XXXX</a> and other parameters. </p>\n<p>I was under the assumption that the test step would be to perform a GET request to the FHIR patient Resource with an invalid bearer token or wrong patientID with the correct bearer token.<br>\nSample Request: <br>\n1. GET <a href=\"https://fhirServerURL/fhir/Patient/patientID\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://fhirServerURL/fhir/Patient/patientID\">https://fhirServerURL/fhir/Patient/patientID</a> with an invalid bearer token.<br>\n2.
