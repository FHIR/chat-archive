Are we are supposed to set this only for mandatory elements? I took a look at the Inferno Reference Server results and there is one record in \"Condition\" resource with Category as unknown. We always set a category because it is either a problem, diagnosis or a health concern. The one place that I can think of where I can use DataAbsentReason extension is in Identifer (it is mandatory) for Person resource. An MRN may not be present in our system,<br>\nIf MRN is not present, can I set the element to <br>\n\"Identifier\": [<br>\n         {<br>\n           \"extension\": [<br>\n             {<br>\n               \"url\": \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/data-absent-reason\">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/data-absent-reason</a>\",<br>\n               \"valueCode\": \"unknown\"<br>\n             }<br>\n           ]<br>\n         }<br>\n       ]<br>\nAlso, say the LastName is not present in a Practitioner's name, since Name is required, I am assuming we can then set the data-absent-reason to unknown.<br>\n\"name\": [<br>\n         {<br>\n           \"extension\": [<br>\n             {<br>\n               \"url\": \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/data-absent-reason\">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/data-absent-reason</a>\",<br>\n               \"valueCode\": \"unknown\"<br>\n             }<br>\n           ]<br>\n         }<br>\n       ]<br>\nor <br>\nif I have data from an external Organization, since I am not confident if the status is Active or not,  I could set Active to \"unknown\"?<br>\n\"active\": [<br>\n         {<br>\n           \"extension\": [<br>\n             {<br>\n               \"url\": \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/data-absent-reason\">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/data-absent-reason</a>\",<br>\n               \"valueCode\": \"unknown\"<br>\n             }<br>\n           ]<br>\n         }<br>\n       ]<br>\nAre there any other scenarios where I can use this extension?<br>\nThanks.</p>",
