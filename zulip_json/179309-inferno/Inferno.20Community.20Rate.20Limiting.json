I was just trying out the latest version and confirmed it is still an issue, but now I'm trying the latest version out with a Postgres DB attached via docker-compose and it seems to be working better, although I still have some problems. In this case I was running about 5 tests in parallel and after a while the chrome tabs all lock up and stop running anything. If I try to open a new tab to the localhost:4567 it just hangs. However, if I try to curl or load up an incognito session it responds and lets me start off another test run. So it seems to me like there is some kinda rate limiting in there, or maybe there's something in the session that is triggering this behavior. Any ideas?</p>",

I don't think Inferno does any sort of session-based tracking, and cookies are only used to help manage state across redirects in the OAuth tests.</p>",
