We found that we had test errors because inferno is setting the code verifier to a UUID which is only 36 characters while the spec for PKCE says it must be between 43 and 182 characters. I opened a PR to the github repo this morning to resolve this. Could someone review? We are trying to certify next month so we need to get these tests passing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/inferno-framework/smart-app-launch-test-kit/issues/14\">https://github.com/inferno-framework/smart-app-launch-test-kit/issues/14</a></p>",
