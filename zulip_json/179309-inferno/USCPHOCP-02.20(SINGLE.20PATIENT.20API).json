When it tries to POST a URL, it does not encode plus (+) in the URL and hence our FHIR server throws error. The moment I replace + with %2B it works fine.

My current finding is that when Inferno read the 2nd page of search result, it uses the url provided in <code>Bundle.link</code>. Can you take a look at the <code>Bundle.link.url</code> in the first page of search result. Does the next link have \"+\" sign at the same place?</p>",
