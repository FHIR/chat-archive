It appears that Inferno is choking on the fact that I don't have the optional .index.json file in my package.

I wasn't aware that we only accepted files named <code>package.tgz</code>. You can put any <code>.tgz</code> files in the <code>igs</code> folder and they will be loaded at startup: <a href=\"https://github.com/inferno-framework/fhir-validator-wrapper/tree/master/igs\">https://github.com/inferno-framework/fhir-validator-wrapper/tree/master/igs</a></p>",
