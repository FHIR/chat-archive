We do have dozens of optional (SHOULD) tests that are disabled/hidden for ONC Standardized API certification right now, but we would like to allow users to enable them if they are interested in going above/beyond the minimum requirements.  An unlocking mechanism after you complete all the SHALL tests would be fun way for that to work ;-)</p>",
