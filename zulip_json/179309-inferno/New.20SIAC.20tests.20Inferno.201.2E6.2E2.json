It is called SMART App Launch Error: Invalid Access Token Request and the Test IDs are SIAC-01 to 04. The new sequence on the other tab is called 'Invalid Access token request' not 'Invalid Authorization Code' as stated in the release notes for 1.6.2. I don't see anything in the release notes about SIAC. After looking at the matrix, SIAC-01 and 02 seem to initiate the Patient Standalone Launch and it appears SPB-OSLS-05 and SPB-OSLS-06 were renamed SIAC-03 and 04. Is this correct?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hello James: That is correct. This change was based on the RFC 6749 requirement that the \"The client MUST NOT use the authorization code more than once\". Server MAY revoke authorization code after the negative test of SPB-OSLS-06. To ensure the normal workflow of SMART authorization, we decided to move both SPB-OSLS-05 and 06 to the \"Other\" tab as SIAC-03 and 04. Yes you are right that the Release Note has the wrong sequence name. I will figure out if we could correct that. Thank you for catching that.</p>",
