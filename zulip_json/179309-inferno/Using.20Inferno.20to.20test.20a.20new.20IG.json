That is a huge hand wave, and I know that. If my memory is correct, can you point me at documentation or a github repo where this is done. I would like to explore so we can make use of existing tooling (e.g., Inferno). If my memory is wrong and there is a better tool for this, a pointer in that direction would be most appreciated.</p>",

What you need to do is, </p>\n<ul>\n<li>unzip IG to <code>/resources/[ig folder name]</code> folder</li>\n<li>run command <code>bundle exec rake:generate['generic','ig folder name']</code><br>\nFor example, if I want to generate tests for IPS without any special treatment, then I copies IPS to <code>/resources/ips</code> folder and run command <code>bundle exec rake:generate['generic','ips']</code><br>\nIf you need special treatment, then you need to create your own generator inheriting from Base generator. There are three generators under <code>/generator</code> folder which demo how to create your own generators.<br>\nPlease let me know if you have more questions.</li>\n</ul>",
