All of the relevant scenarios are contained in the AllergyIntolerance responses, and all required elements are being sent. The CarePlan set contains a single response, which happens to be a Practitioner and thus includes the required agent.onBehalfOf element. The test fails because there is not also an example of agent.type.coding.code:transmitter in the CarePlan response, despite being contained in the relevant AllergyIntolerance responses. Should the test pass given the required scenarios/elements are contained within the full set of responses, or is it intended to assess the subsets distinctly?</p>",
