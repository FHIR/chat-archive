But Inferno test cases expect all different data pointers. So how will this work? Also, regarding the representation of these data pointers (including shall, may, should &amp; cardinalities) when they are not available, do we need to have nodes created under the json or we don't have to present the entire node itself in json. Please suggest.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Inferno Test Cases supports only the FHIR version R4, or it can also have support for other previous FHIR Version? Please suggest.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",
