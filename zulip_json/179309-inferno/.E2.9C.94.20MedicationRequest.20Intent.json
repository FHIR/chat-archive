If I set the intent to \"order\" for all my resource instances, I am getting this error in the test tool - \"Message:<br>\nCannot find second value for intent to perform a multipleOr search\". I am guessing it is because Inferno is looking for records with more than 1 code. This may not be the stream to ask this question, but can you please suggest intent values for patient medication records in an ambulatory environment? In our table, we have meds that are prescribed and not dispensed; meds that are dispensed; meds that have been renewed or refilled and entered-in-error meds. Thank you!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"224800\">@Lakshmi Bhamidipati</span> -- you are right, in a handful of cases we require seeing at least 2 values for an element, instead of just one, to properly verify the 'multipleOr' search requirement.  This is one of those places.  If there is a good reason why an ONC certified system would only support one value here, then we can loosen the restrictions on this test.  We chose to lean on the strict side with our interpretation to start because in practice once something is optional nobody will support it.</p>",

We'd prefer not needing to introduce another intent (since we now support two of them).  Can all of the possible intent codes (including \"order\") please be added back to USCMR-01?</p>",
