We had to modify the inferno docker to incorporate chromedriver and selenium to run the Smart on FHIR sequences. We have it fully working. We are willing to contribute this code back to the OS project if it is of interest.</p>",

We had built in this kind of functionality early on in the project, but haven't maintained it because we've had a lot on our plate.  But if you have done the work of getting that into shape, and upgraded the docker image to include the necessary libraries, I think others would find it useful.</p>",
