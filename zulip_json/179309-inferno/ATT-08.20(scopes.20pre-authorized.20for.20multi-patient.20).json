Inferno is a test application which runs part of the (g)(10) test procedure automatically. The actual certification test is run in a testing lab using Inferno Program edition or equivalent testing programs.  The part of test procedure which could not run by Inferno are generalized as ATT tests which allows testing lab to document the observation and results while doing manual testing.</p>",
