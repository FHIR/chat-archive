I ran the terminology generation a while back (I think 1.6.0), and I've just been copying the files forward into resources/terminology/validators.  With 1.8.0, doing that file copy gives me the banner that terminology files are missing.   I've been looking at PR#337 and PR#391, and I'm curious if I need to re-run the terminology build to get fresh files that work with those updates.    Or do I just need to do something with terminology_config.yml?  I tried using the example file, but still no luck.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I can rerun terminology generation if necessary, but it is a whole process so I wanted to ask before I tried that.</p>",
