The rule <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-07419/p-1210\">excludes any write capabilities</a>, so writing DocumentReferences is outside the scope of testing.  I've been told $docref is out of scope because it is not needed to access USCDI information.  I don't have any offical reference that states that is the case, so this is inferred based on the fact that US Core requirements are bounded by USCDI for certification.</p>",
