But under each individual test (e.g. USCP-01), there should be a line stating what is wrong.  If you didn't state support for Patient search by \"_id\" in your CapabilityStatement, then the skip message should be \"The server doesn't support the search parameters: _id\" for the first test, and then for the later tests we likely would skip because we never even tried getting the patient in the first test.  Generally we try to avoid blocking tests running because of a 'minor' issue early on, but in practice we want to make our tests easy to maintain and deferring errors like this until later in the process gets complicated.</p>",
