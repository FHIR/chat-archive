I think I am finally getting the hang of \"Must Support\" ... It means that the system should demonstrate the ability to send data for at least one of the resource instances. In this case, if my patient belongs to multiple practices in an EHR system (in FHIR speak - organization), then at least one of the practices should have an NPI, the others need not. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192576\">@Robert Scanlon</span>  - Regarding your comment of getting a test to pass by sending a mix of organizations... the reason I asked is because the Inferno reference server Organization tests show some of the organization instances belonging to <a href=\"https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea\">https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea</a> system and the last organization is represented by 3 IDS - an ID belonging to the synthea system , an NPI and an OID</p>",
