However, in the previous version v2.9.0, there were 12. So would like to understand the thought process behind it so that I can extend the tests in a logical way</p>",

        "content": "<p>The US Core 3.1.0 and US Core 3.1.1 tests are built based on different versions of the US Core IG and the changes are a result in differences in the IG.  These changes are not a result of any core Inferno changes, which is currently at Version 2.11.0.  See the <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core-R4/#change-notes-for-ver-311-technical-errata-to-us-core-for-review\">US Core 3.1.1 Change Notes</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>So, for example, US Core 3.1.1 tests not include a sequence for Pediatric Head Occipital-Frontal Circumference Percentile Tests.  This profile was added in 3.1.1.  Both 3.1.1 and 3.1.0 include Missing Data Tests (DAR checks) and FHIR validation.</p>\n<p>The architecture of <a href=\"https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno\">Inferno Community</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program\">Inferno Program</a> is largely the same, but there are minor differences in the implementation for features that are unique to each.</p>\n<p>Both do the same type of FHIR validation.  Request validation is dependent on the IG and interaction being tested (tests for bulk data are different than those for US Core).</p>\n<p>USCCP-01 is the same between Inferno Program (<a href=\"https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program/blob/8a7fa4e226dc139f5fb913a6e9ac413a0cd1d648/lib/modules/uscore_v3.1.0/us_core_careplan_sequence.rb#L208\">source</a>) and Inferno Community (<a href=\"https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno/blob/d1e9b92b3283122c8862a99d94eeb1183df5196e/lib/modules/uscore_v3.1.0/us_core_careplan_sequence.rb#L208\">source</a>).  In general these tests are largely the same, but there may be some small underlying differences or complementary tests.</p>\n<p>Tests are added or removed based on the requirements in the IG.  You can extend tests by adding to the source code directly or subclassing existing tests (<a href=\"https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program/blob/development/lib/modules/onc_program/onc_standalone_smart_discovery_sequence.rb\">e.g.</a>).</p>\n<p>I should note that we are actively working on updating the core of Inferno to make it easier for others to use/develop/understand.  We'll have more to report on that in the coming weeks/month...</p>",
