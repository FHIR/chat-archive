For a single prescription, there are several columns including physical examination &amp; history, allergies, medication, advice, diagnosis etc.</p>\n<p>I need to write a c# code where I can convert all this prescription information including patient information. I had tried writing c# code but I faced some issues:-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We  don't have any FHIR server implemented but just have to map the data from database in FHIR, in this case, certain terminologies I dont understand are taken from FHIR server. For example</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"entry\": [<br>\n    {<br>\n      \"fullUrl\": \"Composition/3b990853-f0fa-4046-8388-d71dd93a0fa1\",<br>\n      \"resource\": {<br>\n        \"resourceType\": \"Composition\",<br>\n        \"id\": \"3b990853-f0fa-4046-8388-d71dd93a0fa1\",<br>\n        \"identifier\": {<br>\n          \"system\": \"<a href=\"https://www.max.in/document\">https://www.max.in/document</a>\",<br>\n          \"value\": \"3b990853-f0fa-4046-8388-d71dd93a0fa1\"<br>\n        },</p>\n<p>In the above-mentioned example, I don't have any Composition in the FullURL parameter.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>In the prescription format specified in SNOMED CT, this is the code for Prescription 440545006. And in the JSON format, there is an only practitioner, patient, and medication however there is no information regarding allergies or diagnosis or complaints. How to include all this information in prescription FHR</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I tried to create a model class from JSON, but certain parameters remain null which doesnt make a valid FHIR format.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Anyone who had implemented Converting raw data into prescription in c# kindly help.</p>",
