In these cases, manufacturer MUST be specified as well. We support using GTIN, GLN (a part of GTIN), or MVX for this. GTIN is the preferred approach.</p>\n<p>This also adds LOINC answers for lab test results (in addition to the SNOMED codes we were previously using).</p>\n<p><strong>If there are any other code systems you would like to see support for or any other comments, please let us know before our content freeze on Saturday, May 8.</strong></p>\n<p>Please leave comemnts on this topic or <a href=\"https://github.com/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/pull/132\">on the GitHub pull request</a>.

For US GTINs, the product can be extracted by ignoring digits on the right-hand slide of the GTIN, and we're told by GS1 that the GTINs for COVID vaccines are the same everywhere.</p>\n<p>Presumbly the product can also be identified by doing some sort of GTIN lookup, though I couldn't figure out how to do this myself with the public lookup tools I found.</p>\n<p>I have a list of questions for the GS1 folks, so I added this to that. We'll plan on providing more context on GTIN inside the IG once we talk with GS1.</p>",
