The prospect of preventing someone from verifying their vaccination status because of a misgendering, or introducing the evaluation of a person's gender into the context of vaccine verification, raises serious concerns that we wanted to avoid. (This is true especially because SMART Health Cards are designed to be used <a href=\"https://spec.smarthealth.cards/#can-a-smart-health-card-be-used-as-a-form-of-identification\">in the context of some existing identification</a>; the aim has been to include just enough identity information to bind them.)  If this is a show-stopper in the Australian context, that'd be good to understand; but it sounds like the jury is still out on that.</p>",
