There's no documentation of this capability on <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/getting-vaccinated/check-immunisation-history\">AIR's public website</a> (that I've found), let alone a technical explanation of how the credentials actually work (for example: are they SHCs? a proprietary format? WHO's spec?) </p>\n<p>(<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191367\">@Brian Postlethwaite</span>, as one of my favorite HL7 Aussie, do you happen to know?)</p>",

As a side note <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191864\">@Isaac Vetter</span>, we are hearing pretty universally now the IBM solution isn't getting much traction in the market. WHO's spec also doesn't appear to be moving forward. SHC appears to be gaining the most traction across the globe thanks to your support and others so thank you! A group of us hope to get more jurisdictions on board next week at the AIRA conference by discussing the use of SHCs by multiple state and national verifiers.</p>",
