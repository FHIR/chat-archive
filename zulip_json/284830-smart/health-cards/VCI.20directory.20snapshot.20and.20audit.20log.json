After reading over the available material online that provides an overview and the Smart Health card creation and deployment process (this will be a strictly \"print\" solution via paper or PDF with QR Code embedded), one of the first steps described is to acquire a VCI for the customers medical practice operation.  In this case, as previously mentioned, a lab testing and immunization clinic.  </p>\n<p>I have reviewed much of the available documentation, including the Vaccine Credential Initiative Directory Agreement, and finally I have found the VCI Directory Issuer Request Form in Google Docs.  My firm will be subcontracted to maintain the SHC's on it's own server as part of the working arrangement.  Obviously being a medical bespoke software firm, we ARE NOT the clinic, thus, my question is as follows:</p>\n<p>Who fills out the request form, the the lab or the company maintaining the data for the lab?  Who is supposed to register based upon the records and who maintains them?</p>\n<p>I need clarification before I send this to my client to confirm which domains need to be listed under the lab's name.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance for any help.</p>\n<p>A Gonzalez<br>\nPrincipal<br>\nAG Consulting</p>",
