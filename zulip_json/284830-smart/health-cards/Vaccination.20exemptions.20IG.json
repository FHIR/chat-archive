        "content": "<p>Following up with some more info on how Cerner represents the concept of a 'vaccine exemption'.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical Workflow:</strong><br>\nA provider can document a vaccine does as 'not given' or 'not done' for a variety of reasons. This primarily exists to inform the patient's immunization schedule (e.g. the patient is currently sick with the flu, so XYZ vaccine is being postponed until the next visit). When documenting that a vaccine was not given, the provider documents a Type and Reason against an Immunization (e.g. COVID19, DTap, etc). Type may include entries such as 'Contraindicated', 'Refused', or 'Unnecessary', with a corresponding Reason that flexes by Type, such as 'Current Acute Illness' or 'Patient Currently Pregnant'.</p>\n<p>Immunization records documented as 'not given' can be sent to an IIS but this is variable by healthcare provider and the state IIS. Not all states ISS in the US accept records for 'not given'.</p>\n<p><strong>Data Representation:</strong><br>\nIn Cerner, Immunization records documented as 'not given' are returned as a FHIR Immunization resource. These records have a status of 'not-done' with a corresponding statusReason code. </p>\n<p>Below is an example response for a patient with their COVID immunization recorded as 'refused'.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code> {\n            &quot;fullUrl&quot;: &quot;https://fhir-ehr.cerner.com/r4/nya9mWd9vqI_z1LcF5uLfCwewAGCVrY1/Immunization/M30182295&quot;,\n            &quot;resource&quot;: {\n                &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;Immunization&quot;,\n                &quot;id&quot;: &quot;M30182295&quot;,\n                &quot;meta&quot;: {\n                    &quot;versionId&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\n                    &quot;lastUpdated&quot;: &quot;2022-02-28T14:11:11-06:00&quot;\n                },\n                &quot;text&quot;: {\n                    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;generated&quot;,\n                    &quot;div&quot;: &quot;&lt;div xmlns=\\&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\\&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Immunization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vaccine&lt;/b&gt;: SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) AstraZeneca vacc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Occurrence&lt;/b&gt;: Feb 28, 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Patient&lt;/b&gt;: GLAZA, THOMAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Status&lt;/b&gt;: Not Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Status Reason&lt;/b&gt;: Postpone due to refusal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organization&lt;/b&gt;: Baseline West Primary Care Clinic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;\n                },\n                &quot;identifier&quot;: [\n                    {\n                        &quot;system&quot;: &quot;https://fhir.cerner.com/ceuuid&quot;,\n                        &quot;value&quot;: &quot;CE4d4104c0-5fd3-43b6-8fb3-0e9680f3cfcd-30182295-2022022820111100&quot;\n                    }\n                ],\n                &quot;status&quot;: &quot;not-done&quot;,\n                &quot;statusReason&quot;: {\n                    &quot;coding&quot;: [\n                        {\n                            &quot;system&quot;: &quot;https://fhir.cerner.com/nya9mWd9vqI_z1LcF5uLfCwewAGCVrY1/codeSet/30441&quot;,\n                            &quot;code&quot;: &quot;688466&quot;,\n                            &quot;display&quot;: &quot;Postpone due to refusal&quot;,\n                            &quot;userSelected&quot;: true\n                        },\n                        {\n                            &quot;system&quot;: &quot;http://snomed.info/sct&quot;,\n                            &quot;code&quot;: &quot;12661000175102&quot;,\n                            &quot;display&quot;: &quot;Temporarily refused (qualifier value)&quot;,\n                            &quot;userSelected&quot;: false\n                        }\n                    ],\n                    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Postpone due to refusal&quot;\n                },\n                &quot;vaccineCode&quot;: {\n                    &quot;coding&quot;: [\n                        {\n                            &quot;system&quot;: &quot;https://fhir.cerner.com/nya9mWd9vqI_z1LcF5uLfCwewAGCVrY1/codeSet/72&quot;,\n                            &quot;code&quot;: &quot;731783247&quot;,\n                            &quot;display&quot;: &quot;SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) AstraZeneca vacc&quot;,\n                            &quot;userSelected&quot;: true\n                        },\n                        {\n                            &quot;system&quot;: &quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/cvx&quot;,\n                            &quot;code&quot;: &quot;210&quot;,\n                            &quot;display&quot;: &quot;SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine, vector non-replicating, recombinant spike protein-ChAdOx1, preservative free, 0.5 mL&quot;,\n                            &quot;userSelected&quot;: false\n                        }\n                    ],\n                    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) AstraZeneca vacc&quot;\n                },\n                &quot;patient&quot;: {\n                    &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;Patient/4314314&quot;,\n                    &quot;display&quot;: &quot;GLAZA, THOMAS&quot;\n                },\n                &quot;occurrenceDateTime&quot;: &quot;2022-02-28&quot;,\n                &quot;primarySource&quot;: true,\n                &quot;performer&quot;: [\n                    {\n                        &quot;actor&quot;: {\n                            &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;Organization/667844&quot;,\n                            &quot;display&quot;: &quot;Baseline West Primary Care Clinic&quot;\n                        }\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            &quot;search&quot;: {\n                &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;match&quot;\n            }\n        },\n</code></pre></div>",

If anybody knows of someone in the US implementing, it would be great to know. </p>\n<p>I can also concur with the discussion on the important difference between not-administering and exempt.
