Interesting questions include: should there be a way to request existing elements but \"blurred\" like a birth month instead of date, or initials instead of a name. Would love to see issuers experiment with this kind of thing; right now other than the demo <a href=\"http://c19.cards\">c19.cards</a> I'm not sure any issuers support this \"includeIdentityClaim\" feature in any capacity.</p>",
