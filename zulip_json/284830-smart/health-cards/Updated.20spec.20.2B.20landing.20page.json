Old web links should (with JS enabled) redirect to the spec, so for example  if you visit <a href=\"https://smarthealth.cards/#can-a-smart-health-card-be-used-as-a-form-of-identification\">https://smarthealth.cards/#can-a-smart-health-card-be-used-as-a-form-of-identification</a> you'll be send to the relevant section of the spec.</p>\n<p>That said, the example issuer now uses a base URL of <code>https://spec.smarthealth.cards/examples/issuer</code>, so <strong>if you have example health cards or other dependencies</strong> on the <code>https://smarthealth.cards/examples/issuer</code> you'll <strong>need to update them</strong>.</p>\n<p>FYI <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"365368\">@James Kizer</span>  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"385047\">@Christian Paquin</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197651\">@Reece Adamson</span> -- not sure if you have such dependencies but just wanted to alert you.</p>",
