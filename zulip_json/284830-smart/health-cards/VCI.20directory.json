Of course back in March, there was no CLEAR guideline to register as the CLINIC only. We have been the platform for registration as well as vaccination record for American Medical Center at Guam. </p>\n<p>Fast forward, we’ve completed the implementation of the W3C standard and passed the test with Common Trust Network; however, according to CTN – the rule just changed 10/25 and that mean the QR codes that we’ve been helping American Medical Center in Guam will not be VALID because the issuer won’t be verified.</p>\n<p>My question is: so far the clinic that we've assisted already completed about 8,000 cases through our platform. Now as people starts to travel again, we've been bombarding with questions regarding why their QR only shown PARTIAL verified. Of course it's because we've spent more than 8 months to go through the right process and now get hold off by the policy changed. How can we proceed with this case? I've submitted email again to <a href=\"mailto:vaccination@mitre.org\">vaccination@mitre.org</a>. We can definitely sign up the American Medical Center as the issuer.</p>",
