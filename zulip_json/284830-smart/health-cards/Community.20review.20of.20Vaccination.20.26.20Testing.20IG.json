I'm reposting here for wider visibility:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The <strong>SMART Health Cards: Vaccination &amp; Testing Implementation Guide</strong> is moving rapidly to meet the needs of implementers in response to the COVID pandemic. </p>\n<p>While we <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PHWG/SMART+Health+Card+-+Vaccination+Credential+IG\">are working to bring the existing IG to HL7</a>, we are also working to get a “stable” release of the current version of the IG in place for implementers to build against. </p>\n<p>(By “stable,” we mean that the current group of implementers within the Vaccination Credential Initiative believes the IG is feature complete and with no known bugs. Our use of “stable” here is not related to the FHIR Maturity Model.) </p>\n<p>To facilitate this, we are trying to get as much feedback on the current version of the IG as possible over the next few weeks. We are looking for a time early next week that anyone interested can meet with the team developing this IG to discuss any questions or feedback. </p>\n<p><strong>If you are interested in joining a meeting to provide feedback on this IG next week, please fill out this meeting time poll before Saturday, April 17th:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.when2meet.com/?11658999-jEcRy\">https://www.when2meet.com/?11658999-jEcRy</a> (and apologies for the short turn-around for this). </p>\n<p>We will reply to this email first thing Monday with the meeting times that work for as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you would like to discuss the IG offline: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The current build: <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/branches/main/\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/branches/main/</a> </li>\n<li>Known issues: <a href=\"https://github.com/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/issues\">https://github.com/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/issues</a> </li>\n<li>Discussion/comments: <a href=\"https://github.com/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/discussions/categories\">https://github.com/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/discussions/categories</a> or email <a href=\"mailto:vci-ig@mitre.org\">vci-ig@mitre.org</a>  </li>\n<li>This Zulip stream (which is being repurposed for general SMART Health Card discussion now that the CARIN Connectathon is over)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Going forward we are planning to set up a recurring call listed on the standard HL7 conference calls calendar. We will send an email update when this is set up. </p>\n<p>There may also be additional calls set up to plan for the <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2021-05+SMART+Health+Cards+for+Vaccination+and+Testing\">HL7 May 2021 Connectathon track for SMART Health Cards for Vaccination and Testing</a>  </p>\n<p>Thank you, <br>\nMax Masnick, on behalf of the Vaccination &amp; Testing IG Team (<a href=\"https://vci.org\">https://vci.org</a>)</p>",
