Library users should also review the repository <a href=\"https://github.com/angusmillar/SmartHealthCard\">ReadMe</a> page for an updated Decoder example. The fix is backwards compatible with existing implementations yet further improves the reporting of such signature validation errors.</p>\n<p>There is also now a bloody test case in place to ensure it does not happen again.</p>\n<p>My sincere apologies for any inconvenience this issue has caused implementers.</p>",
