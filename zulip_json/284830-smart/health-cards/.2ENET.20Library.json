I would suggest using the <a href=\"https://fire.ly/products/firely-net-sdk/\">FIRELY .NET SDK</a> for the task of bundle creation.</p>\n<p>Here it is with examples of use: <a href=\"https://github.com/angusmillar/SmartHealthCard\">SMART Health Card JWS token and QR code generation library</a></p>\n<p>Any bugs report welcome.</p>",
