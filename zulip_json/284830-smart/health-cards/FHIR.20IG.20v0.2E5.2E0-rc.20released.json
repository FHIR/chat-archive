We will be accepting bug reports until Friday, May 21 for anything that needs to be fixed before the stable release goes out. We will hold feature requests for a subsequent release unless they are absoltuely critical for our core use case.</p>\n<p>There are a number of breaking changes in this release, but most are minor. Please let us know if there are any unexpected or problematic breaking changes (again, by Friday, May 21) -- this is still a RC, so there is still time to put in fixes before the final <code>v0.5.0</code> release.</p>",
