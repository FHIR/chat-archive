I think if there were an issue with a particular lot, it would fall to the local health authority or administering clinic to invalidate that vaccination record when they get in touch with the patient to redo the shot.   The health authority I worked with also indicated that the lot number was inconsistently recorded in their database and so they wouldn't provide the value (suggesting we provide \"0\" or \"N/A\" if the value was mandatory).</p>",
