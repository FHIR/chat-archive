I'am not sure what coding system do I need to use for Vaccines which are not included into CVX coding system.  I can see that GTIN (<a href=\"https://www.gs1.org/gtin\">https://www.gs1.org/gtin</a>) is also supported as coding system but I'm not able to find any code for either \"Sputnik V\", \"Astra Zeneka\" and Chinese \"Sinopharm/Sinovac\".  We are currently located in N. Macedonia in Europe. I would appreciate any information you may give.</p>",

Some places like the US and UK have a centralized way to determine the GTIN for a given vaccine, but this may not be the case everywhere. So if the system of record for vaccines doesn't already include GTIN, it may not be easy to add support for this without a central database.</p>\n<p>SNOMED GPS, ICD-11, or ATC/DDD may also be options, but note that these code systems do not identify the \"formulation\" of the vaccine (and ATC/DDD doesn't identify anything other than \"COVID-19 vaccine\"). So if you use one of these code systems, you will also have to identify the manufacturer (which for the purposes of COVID-19 vaccines implies the formulation). <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/branches/main/StructureDefinition-vaccination-credential-immunization.html#vaccine-manufacturer\">There are two options for doing this</a>: (1) include the GTIN, or (2) separately specify the manufacturer with a GLN.</p>\n<p>If none of these options work well for you, please let us know -- if there's a way to extend the IG to support the specifics of your use case, we will try do do so!</p>",
