One key consideration is privacy (e.g., protecting users from being tracked by issuers); it's important to ensure that checks don't reveal a specific certificate ID (but rather, ensure that revocation checks can be aggregated at the level of a group of, say, 10^5 or more certificates).</p>",

The scope of the spec is to provide the clinical data, what happened, when, by/to whom. The fact that the lab result might not be valid anymore to make a health assessment doesn't make the health card itself invalid; verifiers will be able to make their authorization decision based on the data authenticated by the issuer.</p>",
