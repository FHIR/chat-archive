IIRC the LOINC codes were added after the SNOMED codes, but given the difficult SNOMED licensing agreements is there a reason we're not just cutting them and using LOINC only? This would simplify the value set, obviously, and make international use easier because of the much more permissive LOINC licensing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/branches/main/ValueSet-qualitative-lab-result-findings.html#expansion\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/branches/main/ValueSet-qualitative-lab-result-findings.html#expansion</a></p>",

LOINC Answers (LA codes) are not implemented/nor functionality supported in any LIS/LIMS given SCT is required for result values.  Highly recommend LOINC and SCT consistent with other requirements and not requiring different coding for the same item.  SCT is being adopted globally too.  It's true licensing can be an issue for non member countries.  However, at last in person SHIELD meeting several years ago, IHTSDO indicated they can create a value set of result value SCT codes that could be used globally for free.  I don't think work has been done on this yet, though.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I don't think the argument of \"LIMS already send SCT codes in the US\" is too convincing as to keep duplicative codes in the value set. As a counter-point, supporting SCT codes is a huge hurdle for us because of the licensing issue. We support SHC worldwide but will/would have to country-gate resolution of SCT codes, which comes with considerable engineering effort and prevents roll out for lab result SHCs for us (and I don't see a workable way forward). OTOH, mapping that small set of SCT result codes to LOINC codes seems low effort when an SHC implementation has to convert lab data anyway. I would really prefer only having one set of codes so it's clear what implementers should use, and that set should easily be usable internationally which makes me think LOINC is preferable. Happy to hear other arguments, though.</p>",

CLIA lab regulations require the manufacturer/test kit package insert to be followed (deviations result in additional validation/regulatory requirements as it becomes a lab developed test). This also means manufacturer result terms must be used (i.e. detected, not detected versus pos/neg/indeterminate) with the specific assay \"test\".  </p>\n<p>As a result, multiple result codes may be in a value set for all the types of possible responses for a COVID result, but only the responses specified by a package insert can be used for reporting a particular manufacturer's assay by each user.  I'll mention there are known gaps in both LOINC and SNOMED CT so if a code is unavailable (i.e. gray zone for some hepatitis result values), text may be the response.  I'd expect COVID test kit apps or websites to provide their choices in a drop down or other choice to make it easier for consumers to report correctly.</p>",
