A repo with a test directory and test data from different organizations issued by test servers (e.g. the Cerner test server, SMART Health Card spec examples) could also be useful for verifiers testing their issuer directory verification code without needing real examples or having to create and host their own directory. Just a thought and would have to be well marked to avoid misuse.</p>",
