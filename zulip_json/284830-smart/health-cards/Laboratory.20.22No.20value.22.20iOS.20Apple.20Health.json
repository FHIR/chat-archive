The spec outlines special considerations around bundle size, identity binding and content that need to be taken into consideration when designing new profiles (see <a href=\"https://spec.smarthealth.cards/#health-cards-are-small\">https://spec.smarthealth.cards/#health-cards-are-small</a> and <a href=\"https://spec.smarthealth.cards/credential-modeling/\">https://spec.smarthealth.cards/credential-modeling/</a>). In the future, there may be other profiles for wider use like general lab test results that conform to these guidelines.</p>",
