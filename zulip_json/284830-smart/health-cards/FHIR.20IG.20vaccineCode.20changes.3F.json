These could be included in the value set described above. If we did this, should we still include the country-specific SNOMED edition codes as part of the value set, only allow these as supplemental codes, or not allow them at all?</li>\n<li>The CVX/AIR/SNOMED(?) value set would likely be implemented as a required binding in a slice in a separate COVID-19-specific profile of Immunization. We would still have the generic profile as well, and Issuers could fall back to this if needed (mirroring our approach to lab tests).</li>\n<li>I think we want to keep the value set bindings for <code>vaccineCode</code> as <code>required</code> because wallet and verifier apps need to be able to know the full universe of codes they may encounter.</li>\n</ul>",

But as has been pointed out, we can't force any app to do this, and some display names are downright hostile to patients because they were designed for use by providers.</p>\n<p>In the Health app, for example, we currently have a hierarchy of Category -&gt; Concept -&gt; Record. We've curated custom, user-friendly \"Concept\" names such as \"COVID-19 Vaccine\" or \"Flu Vaccine.\" Within the \"COVID-19 Vaccine\" Concept room (which is what we call them) you'll find all of the COVID vaccines that we've mapped to that concept via its CVX code. We're currently using the \"Sole Proprietary Name\" for these COVID vaccines since those seem to be the most user-friendly.</p>\n<p>From our POV, having a curated set of (localized?) COVID-19 vaccine names with a permissive license would mostly solve the problem. Apps would gravitate towards using it and you would likely achieve consistency over time simply because it's 1) freely available and 2) high quality (assuming it's actually high quality). The million dollar question is how we actually get to this Nirvana? Perhaps we need to create our own open terminology and call it ERTH (Entire Reference Terminology for Health)? ;)</p>",

We know that Covid is getting all the attention, and we should focus on supporting that first, but there is a larger need for credentials for all immunizations to support school entry, international travel, employment, etc. In our community we are pushing the adoption of VCI, not as just a Covid-specific solution, but as a general solution that will help meet public health goals we've had for decades.</p>\n<p>So we are going to look and give our feedback first on Covid and then secondarily what would be the benefit/drawbacks when we expand beyond this.
