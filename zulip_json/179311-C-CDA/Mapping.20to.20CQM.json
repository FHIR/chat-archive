We agreed to record assessments in a related section for the associated type of assessment, or the most general Assessments Section, or if no better place is available to use the Results Section.  We also agreed to use the Assessment Scale Observation template for recording the assessment information.  Recording the results implies the assessment was done.  Here's the sample <a href=\"http://cdasearch.hl7.org/examples/view/302a998a-6d91-4f6e-8354-13c7777bdf4b\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://cdasearch.hl7.org/examples/view/302a998a-6d91-4f6e-8354-13c7777bdf4b\">http://cdasearch.hl7.org/examples/view/302a998a-6d91-4f6e-8354-13c7777bdf4b</a> Let me know if this helps with what you are looking for.
