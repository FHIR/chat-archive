As a general rule, I understand that a binding of SHALL requires that values from the specified value set be used.  Is it ever acceptable to use post-coordinated SNOMED codes in C-CDA R2.1?  This particular use case if for family history.  Thanks!</p>",

        "content": "<p>This is a little tricky in CDA.  The intent of having qualifiers as part of the V3 Data Types R1 <code>CD</code> data type was to allow this, but with that structure the ability to do true SNOMED CT post-coordination is rather limited - you can only add one or more qualifiers directly to a focus concept, and there is no way to use (or replicate) anything more complex that is supported in the SNOMED CT compositional grammar.  The V3 Data Types R2 <code>CD</code> data type removed this limitation by making the code a string, which allows a full compositional expression to be used (and that is also how it is done in FHIR), but the R2 data types never made it into CDA.  However, adding qualifiers to an existing pre-coordinated concept may be all that you need to do for something like adding laterality or severity to a concept if none of the available pre-coordinated concepts include that (for example).  Anything that you do add as a qualifier should be consistent with the SNOMED CT concept model, but there isn't any way that is enforced.</p>",

So it needs to be part of an implementation guide or otherwise verified that your trading partners will understand and be able to use it correctly.</p>",
