There are many codes in this system. How can I recognize which classCode should I use when mapping FHIR resources into Result Organizer? I found examples with classCode=\"CLUSTER\" and classCode=\"BATTER\" but again, how to recognize which one should I use? Maybe it should be hardcoded into one of them?</li>\n<li>Moreover, when parsing any FHIR resource into any CDA template, should we use the id of the FHIR resource to create an &lt;id /&gt; tag in the document or we should just stick to the identifier field and use only identifiers to create &lt;id /&gt; tags?</li>\n</ol>",

        "content": "<p>So section 4.3.6.5 of the underlying CDA standard explains CLUSTER vs. BATTERY. It's something like this: BATTERY (battery) A battery specifies a set of observations. These observations typically have a logical or practical grouping for generally accepted clinical or functional purposes, such as observations that are grouped together because of automation. CLUSTER (cluster) A group of entries that have a logical association with one another. The Cluster class permits aggregation into a compound statement.</p>\n<p>You can look in a large sample of C-CDA documents by multiple technologies for certification here: <a href=\"https://github.com/jddamore/ccda-samples/\">https://github.com/jddamore/ccda-samples/</a> <br>\nYou can look at published results samples here: <a href=\"http://cdasearch.hl7.org/sections/Results\">http://cdasearch.hl7.org/sections/Results</a></p>\n<p>Ultimately, I don't think it will have a huge impact whichever you choose, but unless you need complex logical groupings, it may easier to just do BATTERY.</p>",
