Basically, right now there is a very large category maintained by LOINC for all sorts of Diagnostic Reports.  We just need to have them subcategorize this big bucket into some valuable sub-categories.  Codes in the LOINC document  ontology can be used at the document/code, section/code, or organizer/code level to answer the question, what kind of information is this?  Let's add this to the discussion with the LOINC Document Ontology Committee on April 9th.</p>",
