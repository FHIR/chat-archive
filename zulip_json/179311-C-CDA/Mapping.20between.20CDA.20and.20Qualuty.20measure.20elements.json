I though the QRDA spec had only template mapping but not element mapping s like FHIR does.</p>\n<p>Lisa, on the call, it is mentioned that Clinical Notes section needs to be populated. I am pretty sure you have mentioned about it way before but I am not able to find the specs specific to Clinical Notes section. Do you mind guiding me on that again? <br>\nThanks</p>",
