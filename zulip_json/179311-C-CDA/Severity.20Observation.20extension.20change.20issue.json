It does not recognize this code when we have extension as \"2014-06-09\" (&lt;templateId root=\"2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.8\" extension=\"2014-06-09\" /&gt;). If we change the extension to \"2017-09-15\", the Severity observation code: 371923003  gets validated. We are trying to find out when where this extension change happened. I checked the Companion Guides and could not find any related information for the new extension that ETT tool requires. Can someone please let us know if you know when this change is released and where? Thanks.</p>",
