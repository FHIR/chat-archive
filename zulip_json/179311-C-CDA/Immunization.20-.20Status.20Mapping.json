When you look at the Summary for C-CDA tab in Column A,  it identifies a moodCode = EVN  (MedicationStatement or MedicationAdministration ) and then in Column A lower down it say moodCode=\"INT' (From MedicationPrescriptionStatus)  </p>\n<p>I can't tell if the sheet is summarizing the use of these two moodCodes with just the substanceAdministration act, or if in the case of moodCode=\"INT\" for a prescription, this is really talking about a supply act.  Can you tell if it is summarizing both substanceAdminstration acts and supply acts, or is it saying a substanceAdministration with a moodCode=\"INT\" represents \"a prescription\".  That just doesn't make sense, does it?  A prescription is represented with a supply act in moodCode=\"RQO\".</p>\n<p>There are several open issues documented at the bottom of the page that allude to this not being fully figured out yet.  If you follow the US Core profile work around medicationStatement, you will see we continue to have the opportunity to clear this up.</p>",
