If we can determine that the problem is either 'active' or 'completed', do I need to give the user the ability to indicate 'aborted' or/and 'suspended' in addition?  I find it strange that the actClass is required but the clinical problem status is optional.  Any guidance is greatly appreciated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't think that actStatus needs to be supported beyond completed (unless, of course, there is a specific template that needs to be supported and that indicates a different value).</p>",
