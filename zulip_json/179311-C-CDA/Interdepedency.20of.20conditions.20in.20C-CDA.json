Would multiple entryRelationship/Observations under the same Entry/Act be kosher and accomplish this, although there isn't a very good usage of \"text\" at the Entry/Act level from what I've witnessed.</p>",

You can't \"combine\" these concepts to create semantic meaning from the combination. <br>\nFrom a purist point of view, these are supposed to be equivalent translations of the same concept.  In reality we tolerate variation that is more specific.  And sometimes, I've seem more general, but that is pushing it.  We run the risk that \"this\" may always be a \"that\", but \"that\" isn't always a \"this\". </p>\n<p>CDA Examples task force has grappled with inventing a way to do post coordination of terms in the value element, but it hasn't gone anywhere. This would make a GREAT C-CDA IAT Topic for October.  Please consider it.  You know observation supports multiple value elements.  Perhaps a template that support post coordination could be invented based on business requirements/use cases that you present...and a possible straw-man design to be considered.</p>\n<p>Ben and Gay both have interest in this area as well.<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"193933\">@Benjamin Flessner</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191991\">@Gay Dolin</span></p>",

If it is something they came up with \"internally\" (maybe based on a bad interpretation of CCDA) and they never worked with HL7 on making sure it was \"kosher\", is this something someone(s) at HL7 would approach them about?   And depending on how they respond to HL7 (ie, they go \"meh, we like what we did here\"), would HL7 \"proclaim\" publicly that they are a \"bad actor\" in representing CCDA?  Just wondering what HL7 does to \"promote\" correct usage in this way... I know they can't be \"everywhere\", but, just wondering what the protocols are in that fashion.</p>",

The template design would explain that the value holds \"all true\" diagnosis codes.  This pattern might make Problem Observation more fit for purpose for the use case of representing diagnoses.  </p>\n<p>In general, I feel we have outgrown the time when the Problem Observation template's binding of the code element to a kitchen sink of concepts is helping us.  I would love to a project to clarify nuanced guidance for how and where to use this template for each of the codes listed in the ValueSet Problem Type (SNOMEDCT)  2.16.840.1.113883.3.88.12.3221.7.2</p>",

I agree that if the current constraints are too limiting for problems that we likely need to modify that to allow for more concept codes to be \"grouped\" for a broader problem concept that otherwise doesn't have a single code in a particular codeset (generally either aiming for fully \"conceptualized\" in either ICD-10 codes or SNOMED codes, depending on reasoning for usage).</p>\n<p>I am open to whatever is the best path to go down to move on this, if some sort of sub-group with at least us 4 (Lisa, Ben, Gay and I) to discuss and come up with suggestions prior to possible discussion at the July IAT is appropriate or something else.</p>",
