Thanks</p>\n<p>1) Need to know the specific HL7 C-CDA guide to use for unsolicited unstructured EDI Attachments.   Is it this the correct guide?  <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/ccdasearch/templates/2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.1.10.html\">http://www.hl7.org/ccdasearch/templates/2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.1.10.html</a></p>\n<p>2) Need to know where in the HL7 C-CDA guide to clearly ID the structure of the HL7 unsolicited header data that we can expect to receive in the 275.  We need to know where to find the list of fields in the guide; and possibly how to interpret the list of fields in the guide.</p>\n<p>3)  Need to know the schema to use for unsolicited unstructured clinical data (e.g., operative notes, medical records, etc) and where in the header or body it denotes this.  How do you figure out what schema to use for each type of unstructured attachment data?  By the LOINC value?  Root Number? </p>\n<p>4) Need to develop a list of items to know from the HL7 C-CDA guide for implementation.</p>",
