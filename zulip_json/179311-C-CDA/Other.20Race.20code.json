If Other Race is documented on the EHR side, should the racecode element be represented using nullFlavor (OTH) &amp; Other Race included using sdtc:raceCode?</p>",

But, now with multiple races possible, that isn't necessary?</p>\n<p>Just trying to decipher why there is even an \"other race\", if it is currently (from HL7 or other standards) not considered a \"proper code\".</p>\n<p>On your link you shared Brett, that seems specifically talking about for a \"don't know\" situation, not \"other race\", unless I misread the page wrong?</p>",
