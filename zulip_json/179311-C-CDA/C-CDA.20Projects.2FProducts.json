Does anyone know good open source projects or paid solution to provide an abstract ion to the base implementation guide? I started reading through the IG and have been coming across projects like these: <a href=\"https://github.com/projectcypress/cdatools\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/projectcypress/cdatools\">https://github.com/projectcypress/cdatools</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/amida-tech/blue-button\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/amida-tech/blue-button\">https://github.com/amida-tech/blue-button</a> but these seem no longer maintained and unreliable. I'm looking for someone who's done work to abstract the sections/entries of the C-CDA into simpler data structures  that I can create based on my own database used for our EMR. Thanks!</p>\n<p>PS: I'm also looking into the CCDA on FHIR project as an avenue as well so if anyone has experience implementing off of that let me know!</p>",
