The confluence page link is here - <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PC/Ophthalmology+FHIR+Project\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PC/Ophthalmology+FHIR+Project</a>. The goal is to publish IG/s based on defined use cases and drive adoption of FHIR/interoperability within the ophthalmic community. We address technical, clinical and political matters and interface with other groups (eg device / EHRs as required). All welcome to join mettings / post questions / submit ideas</p>",
