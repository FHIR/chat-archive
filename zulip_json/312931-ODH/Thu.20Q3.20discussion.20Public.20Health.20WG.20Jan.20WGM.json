Several ODH data elements are up for consideration for USCDI. We have multiple ODH-related products, including a Guide to Collection for EHR developers <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2022-101/\">https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2022-101/</a>  and a Functional Profile <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=498\">http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=498</a> plus the interoperability templates (FHIR is here: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/odh/STU1/\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/odh/STU1/</a> ) and an information model <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa070\">https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa070</a> .  We are also starting an ODH DAM do build on the existing model. We would especially appreciate discussion with EHR vendors, but welcome all feedback and conversation.</p>",
