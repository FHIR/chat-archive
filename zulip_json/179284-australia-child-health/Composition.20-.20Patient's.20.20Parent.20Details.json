Please note the details can be the patient's parent or a legal guardian as well.  I can think of the following two options to achieve this:</p>\n<p>Option 1.  Add RelatedPerson resource(s) corresponding to the Patient in the same document bundle and use Provenance in the document Bundle to link them. <br>\nOption 2.  Slice the 'Patient.contact'and capture them accordingly. </p>\n<p>Knowing the context is more about capturing information about the Patient, I'm more inclined to use the Option 1.  </p>\n<p>Any thoughts/Suggestion?</p>",
