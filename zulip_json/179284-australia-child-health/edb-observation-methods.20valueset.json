I managed to find an EDB Observation profile (referenced from the EDB Composition, although it doesn't seem to be in the list of Observation profiles), and that profile seems to reference the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ch/v1/ValueSet/ncdhc-edb-observation-methods\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ch/v1/ValueSet/ncdhc-edb-observation-methods\">http://hl7.org/fhir/ch/v1/ValueSet/ncdhc-edb-observation-methods</a> ValueSet for Observation.method, but I can't find that ValueSet anywhere. Any tips?</p>",
