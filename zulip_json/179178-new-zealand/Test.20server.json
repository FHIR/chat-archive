It would be helpful to understand your full use case (e.g. are you just looking for patient demographics) - but, as a general point, it is contrary to NZ Privacy regulations to place 'live' NHI numbers on test servers or, indeed, to expose them via any service without the requisite authentication and authorization. There is an NHI Web Service but, unfortunately, it's not a FHIR API. However it is possible to load data, containing test versions of NZ identifiers, on any number of FHIR test servers and run test queries. At present, I don't think that there are publically-available FHIR test servers in NZ - outside of what can be persisted on David Hay's clinFHIR Server -but they shouldn't be too far away.</p>",

We won't be  allocating these in prod/live so any Z NHI can be used with confidence that it's fictional data and that the Identifier itself hasn't been issued to anyone (even if you're using it with different data).  </p>\n<p>Would be a good idea to use this convention for any test FHIR servers too..</p>",
