I'm browsing y'all's simplifier specs -- and it looks like the <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7NZ/nzbase/branches/master/toc.html\">FHIR NZ Base profiles</a> are the closest. Is this right?</p>",

The first release only has extensions, identifiers and terminology. We'll be starting on national profiles in the next release. However, the issue of patient access is most likely to be tackled in a new project that's just started to create an NZ derivation of the IPS and hopefully that will consider the IPA project.</p>",
