Please note that there is a breaking change in the structure of the ConceptMap resource which means that you'll need to update any dependent client that uses the resource itself (rather than just issuing $translate requests) accordingly. The next addition will be a ValueSet of NZULM prescribing terms, not sure if that will make the new release.</p>\n<p>Update - I've deployed the new version and it passes all the Touchstone Tests. It does include 3 new Value Sets from NZULM, sourced from the Prescribing Terms Selection Table...<br>\n<code>NZULM_Prescribing_Terms_Generic</code> (generic drugs only - nearly all originate from the Medicinal Product Unit of Use primary NZMT table)<br>\n<code>NZULM_Prescribing_Terms_Trade</code> (trade drugs only - nearly all originate from the Trade Product Unit of Use primary NZMT table)<br>\n<code>NZULM_Prescribing_Terms</code>  (this includes all the concepts from the above 2 value sets)</p>",

It will also faithfully honour R3 client requests (if that version is specified in the Accept Header). Among the new Terminology features supported are the Terminology Capabilities resource, CodeSystem $validate-code operation, a very basic example of CodeSystem.Supplements (using the test bundle-type value sets supplied by Grahame) - plus a basic implementation of the Expression Constraint Language (ecl) filter on Implicit SCT Value Sets. As per my post on Naming Systems, that resource is now supported. Lots there (inc. latest NZMT and HPI data, SCT IE v 20170731, LOINC v2.61, UCUM etc) - but still read-only.</p>",

Unfortunately, it no longer supports R3 clients as maintaining 2 versions within a single code base became impractical. New features include the NZ Edition of SNOMED CT (fhir_vs=refset now works and returns concept IDs &amp; PTs of all NZ RefSets) and support for the $preferred-id operation on the NamingSystem resource.
