The discussion in Q2 at the WGM today was somewhat inconclusive. The clear advice is NOT to use the ClinicalImpression resource for this purpose - the proposed alternatives are to use a re-scoped version of the Composition resource or create a new resource. It's certainly feasible to use Composition and an example of using that resource to render a SOAP note was shown; however, there was pushback against the notion of placing content in the Composition resource that is not available elsewhere.</p>",
