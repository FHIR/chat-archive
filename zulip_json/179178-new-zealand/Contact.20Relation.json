Can you point me more specifically?</p>",

For anything not covered in that HISO standard, or one of the 'common code tables' on the Ministry Web Site, I'd follow the FHIR specification. For GP2GP and other CDA-based projects, we use the V3/CDA vocabulary and participant class for next of kin, emergency contact, guardian, etc. - they <em>should</em> all translate to the corresponding FHIR Value Sets.</p>",
