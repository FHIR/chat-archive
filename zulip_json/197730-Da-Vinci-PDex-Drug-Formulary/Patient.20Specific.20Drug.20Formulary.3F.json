Though out of scope, it says that patients may pull meds form EHR and then look them up. Could they also pull meds from their payer(s) and do the same?</p>",

What are the plan-level costs for a specific Rx on the member's plan, and what alternatives are available (optional).   The Formulary IG doesn't provide any specific support for this use case, so it is up to the client of the API to make queries that are constrained to the coverage plan associated with the member.</p>",
