We didn't make it to the Connectathon 25 Formulary track, but I was there for the readout last Friday. For example: during the HL7 webinar we saw pricing/cost information being displayed. However, to get pricing/cost data requires multiple steps, such as selection of a particular pharmacy. Just checking, are you the right individuals to reach out to on questions like this or can you point me in the right direction?</p>\n<p>Thank you,<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"296344\">@Joel Hansen (Aetna)</span></p>",
