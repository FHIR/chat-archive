The available selections for CopayOption and CoinsuranceOption don't seem to fit if the Medicaid Plan has a deductible of $0.  All of these would mislead the member if there is no deductible:<br>\nafter-deductible<br>\nbefore-deductible<br>\nno-charge<br>\nno-charge-after-deductible</p>\n<p>Is there something we're missing?   We can use \"after-deductible\" for now but recommend adding another selection that is specific to this situation for the next build.  What are your thoughts?  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"331329\">@Courtney Bland</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"331378\">@Vanessa Candelora</span></p>",
