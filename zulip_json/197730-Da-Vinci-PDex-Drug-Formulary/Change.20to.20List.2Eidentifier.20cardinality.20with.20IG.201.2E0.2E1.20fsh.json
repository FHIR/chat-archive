But in versions after this (including the current build - <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-formulary/StructureDefinition-usdf-CoveragePlan.html\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-formulary/StructureDefinition-usdf-CoveragePlan.html</a>), within the actual structure definition, the cardinality follows the base resource - 0..*. </p>\n<p>Was this an intentional change to allow more than one identifier on List? </p>\n<p>If so, we may need to update the model diagrams included in the IG.<br>\nIf not, is this something that can be considered to keep?  (Given the different discussion threads about the plan ID to use, we actually prefer having the ability to include multiple business identifiers for a plan -- HIOS plus an internal pbm plan code, for example.)</p>\n<p>The issue then comes down to how plan ID is referenced within FormularyDrug/MedicationKnowledge. That extension type is currently only a string so there can only be one value.  (Has there been any consideration to changing the type to be identifier vs string?)<br>\ncc: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"270256\">@Bapi Behera</span></p>",

Such constraints also make it difficult/impossible for implementations to comply with multiple IGs simultaneously.  So, whether intentional or not, relaxing the constraint is a good thing.</p>",
