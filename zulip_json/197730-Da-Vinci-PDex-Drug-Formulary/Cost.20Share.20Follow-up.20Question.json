Likewise, what should be populated for copayment money amount when there is only a coinsurance?</p>\n<p>There is a coinsurance option of \"no charge\" but that can be misconstrued as meaning there is no charge to the member. (And the definition of this is that deductible doesn't apply, not that there isn't a value.)  </p>\n<p>There is a difference between a $0 copayment and null copayment. Likewise, 0% coinsurance could be interpreted as \"no patient pay\" (and 100% looks like full member pay).   Can we use the no data absent extension to explicitly state there is no copayment amount  or coinsurance?</p>\n<p>Also, have there been any discussions about scenarios where there is both a copayment and coinsurance where comparators are needed for less of/greater of applies?</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"270256\">@Bapi Behera</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"217847\">@Mona O</span></p>",

The coinsurance rate is not included and the coinsurance option is 'no charge'.  They also have a value for just 'flat copay' (first highlighted example) for a tier that isn't subject to the deductible (while the second tier is).<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/CGXiQ_LQDdyLYjkMerK1NIxA/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/CGXiQ_LQDdyLYjkMerK1NIxA/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/CGXiQ_LQDdyLYjkMerK1NIxA/image.png\"></a></div>",
