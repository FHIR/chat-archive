That proxy NDC could end up changing.  Does the FHIR logical ID assigned to the first NDC have to be used for the new NDC? For example, NDC of 59148003085 gets a FHIR logical ID 12345.  It gets a new proxy NDC before it is assigned an RXCUI.  Should the new proxy NDC of 4444900308 get a new FHIR logical ID or should it get 12345?  Does it matter?  When the RXCUI gets assigned, should it reflect a FHIR logical ID of 12345?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thank you for your time.</p>",

Thank you for the message.<br>\nUnfortunately, I do not have an example to share.  We don't currently store, in any of our databases, when an RxCUI becomes available.  RxCUI is not considered a critical data element in our systems as they stand today.  The feedback was provided by our business partners based on their experiences, but they did not have a precise example to supply.  Since we will be going live relatively soon, we have decided to record an error for any drug in our formulary that does not have an RXCUI at the time the record is supposed to be created for the Formulary Profile or the Coverage Profile in our database.  That drug will not be returned back in any API response until an RXCUI is generated.  If the consuming app asks for that specific drug by name or NDC, they will given the standard message indicating that a record was not found.  If this situation occurs after we go live, then we will provide the examples that you seek from our error log.  It would be great if we could see what other payers might think on the matter.  cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"360036\">@Mark Neumuth</span></p>",

Here is the breakdown of the NDCs after analysis with the RxNorm API.<br>\nThe status of the API returned by the API is one of:<br>\nACTIVE. The NDC is recognized by RxNorm as active and is associated with an active concept. The RxCUI associated with the NDC is contained in the returned history data.<br>\nOBSOLETE. The NDC previously existed in RxNorm, but is no longer recognized as active. The history data will indicate the time periods and RxCUI(s) associated with the NDC.<br>\nALIEN. The NDC is or was contained only in a source vocabulary other than RxNorm. This status means that the NDC has never been active in RxNorm.<br>\nUNKNOWN. The NDC is unknown or invalid. This means that the NDC has never been active in RxNorm, is not in a source vocabulary other than RxNorm, and no history data is available.<br>\nActive and obsolete NDCs are curated by RxNorm, as opposed to alien NDCs, only known from some sources, but not curated by RxNorm. Unknown NDCs are absent from RxNorm.<br>\n[omitted table]<br>\nThe vast majority of the NDCs (80%) and even more of the prescriptions (89.3%) correspond to NDCs curated by RxNorm, active or obsolete. Alien NDCs tend to correspond to OTCs, supplements and supplies. They represent a significant proportion of NDCs (14.9%), but relatively few prescriptions (1.6%). Unknown NDCs are uncommon and negligible (0.1%) in terms of prescriptions.</p>\n<p>These results are consistent with similar analyses performed on the Medicare dataset over several billion prescriptions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that if we <strong>must</strong> represent <strong>ALL CONTENT OF FORMULARIES</strong> we can not bind required to <strong>only</strong> RxNorm. The <em>best</em> approach would be to find a code system we can use to represent <em>types</em> that the UPC codes or NDC codes could be mapped to for exchange, similar to what we do for drugs. I have not done an analysis to determine what we might use for an OTC code system. </p>\n<p>I must note that the analysis does show there are <em>rare, but existing</em> drug formulary items that are not in RxNorm. So, a decision that we MUST have all formulary items <strong>encoded</strong> when exchanged may force us to open the binding up to Extensible. Perhaps an alternative would be to come up with a one or more concepts to be used when not in RxNorm and then the actual item can be sent in text along with the generic code we create.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"222957\">@Dave Hill</span> Perhaps for discussion Friday?</p>",
