        "content": "<p>The linkage to the 'List' (CoveragePlan is not just dependent on the Plan ID alone (There is an extension for Plan ID in the MedicationKnowledge resource in DaVinci). One has to also factor in the drug tier (there is an extension for that as well) and the year. From the source plan json we get a Plan with an ID containing a formulary with multiple tiers and Year(s) for which the information is true, e.g. 2020, 2021 etc.. A sample is shown below:<br>\n[<br>\n    {<br>\n        \"plan_id_type\": \"HIOS-PLAN-ID\",<br>\n        \"plan_id\": \"46944AL0280001\",<br>\n        \"marketing_name\": \"Blue Choice Platinum for Business\",<br>\n        \"summary_url\": \"<a href=\"https://www.test.com/b2020BlueChoicePlatinum\">https://www.test.com/b2020BlueChoicePlatinum</a>\",<br>\n        \"plan_contact\": \"<a href=\"mailto:HIMMachineReadableQuestions@test.org\">HIMMachineReadableQuestions@test.org</a>\",<br>\n        \"years\": [<br>\n            2020<br>\n        ],<br>\n        \"network\": [<br>\n            {<br>\n                \"network_tier\": \"TIER-ONE\"<br>\n            }<br>\n        ],<br>\n        \"formulary\": [<br>\n            {<br>\n                \"drug_tier\": \"TIER-ONE\",<br>\n                \"mail_order\": true,<br>\n                \"cost_sharing\": [<br>\n                    {<br>\n                        \"pharmacy_type\": \"1-MONTH-IN-RETAIL\",<br>\n                        \"copay_amount\": 10.0,<br>\n                        \"copay_opt\": \"BEFORE-DEDUCTIBLE\",<br>\n                        \"coinsurance_rate\": 0.0,<br>\n                        \"coinsurance_opt\": \"NO-CHARGE\"<br>\n                    },<br>\nTherefore ideally the medication knowledge resource should contain a drug with with plan id as well as drug-tier &amp; the Year information for it to be successfully bound to the appropriate 'List' resource/CoveragePlan. Is this already discussed, if not is there a plan to introduce an extension for -'Years' in the MedicationKnowledge' resource. I t would be very helpful to have this extension for accurate linkage of the MedicationKnowledge resource to Lst resource. In the meantime , Using MedicationKnowledge.synonym seems to be a good placeholder to enter the 'Year' value.</p>",

Example I may have years 2021 and 2022. Then don't we need to link them correctly year wise?</p>",
