        "content": "<p>We want to place a url to a contact/issue intake page in EmailPlanContact rather than a specific email address.  The contact page gathers input to correctly direct the issue.  Providing the email directly is problematic ... the issue may get delay due to incorrect routing.  Is there anything to preclude placing a url in EmailPlanContact?</p>\n<p>related: I found <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-31673\">FHIR-31673</a> requesting to change the name of EmailPlanContact to SupportContact.  SupportContact, in my mind, could be a phone number, email, or website.</p>",
