        "content": "<p>Along this topic, I have a question on accurate copay support. Looking at the example for v3002, specifically 1st costSharing segment for <strong>1-month-in-retail</strong>, I read it as (which seems backward): </p>\n<ul>\n<li>$10 copay before deductible</li>\n<li>100% coinsurance after deductible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Is this an accurate reading or it is it trying to represent a $10 copay <em>after</em> a 100% before deductible coinsurance?</p>\n<p>It's great to show both the before and after deductible copays without doing two costSharing segments for \u0010<strong>1-month-in-retail</strong> but, if my reading above is correct, how do I format FHIR to say (for these two use cases):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>100% coinsurance before deductible</li>\n<li>$10  copay after deductible has been met</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and</p>\n<ul>\n<li>100% coinsurance before deductible</li>\n<li>15% coinsurance after deductible has been met</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Outside of prevention tier, most of our plans have a 100% deductible then a flat or % copay. What is the best way to support  100% copay before deductible with a $10 copay/15% coinsurance after deductible via PDex?

We have multiple subscribers already integrated with our API and no one identified this as an issue until recently. Based on the data type being a decimal I believe we are not conformant.  Are we indeed not conformant?  <br>\nAre we able to manage this gap through documentation to indicate the value is represented as a percentage or do we need to get all of our current consumers to make changes once we start representing the value as a decimal?
