This makes the repo name consistent with other standardhealth repos and our filename conventions. This change should be relatively transparent because Github automatically redirects <a href=\"https://github.com/standardhealth/shr_spec\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/standardhealth/shr_spec\">https://github.com/standardhealth/shr_spec</a> to <a href=\"https://github.com/standardhealth/shr-spec\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/standardhealth/shr-spec\">https://github.com/standardhealth/shr-spec</a>. We're in the process of updating the documentation to reflect this change.</p>",
