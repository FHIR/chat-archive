You can determine this because of the mapping statement in the DiagnosticReport class (R4), <code>Observation maps to result (slice on = target.reference.resolve(); slice on type = profile; slice strategy = includes)</code>.  There is no need to have an element called <code>result</code> that does nothing more than point to an Observation.</p>",
