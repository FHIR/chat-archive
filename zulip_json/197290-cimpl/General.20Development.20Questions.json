Unfortunately, I think you've found a hole in our mapping language.  There doesn't currently seem to be a good way to fix a value on a specific slice in a profile -- from the mapping file.  Of course, if the value is fixed in the model itself, it all works out -- but what you're trying to do is different (and we don't support fixing <code>string</code>s in the model right now anyway).  Ack.  That stinks.</p>",
