For MedicationAdministration resource&gt; dosage.dose has the data type-SimpleQuantity. The corresponding element in C-CDA is  doseQuantity. My understanding is the data type for this element is IVL_PQ. So when I am trying to map IVL_PQ to Quantity. I am unable to figure out how to map the CDA value if it is a genuine interval-. e.g. doseQuantity-low =2 and doseQuantity-high=3 and unit =mg. In this case when I map it to FHIR 'Quantity' data type - it has got only 'value' but no start or end to capture the low/high interval. Can any one shed light on this? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191570\">@Lisa Nelson</span></p>",

The notion of a range makes sense when ordering or summarizing, but MedicationAdministration isn't used for either of those purposes.  If you have a range in C-CDA, then you must be looking at a summary and should be mapping to MedicationStatement rather than MedicationAdministration.</p>",

Is it possible that moodCode of the act has a role to play here.  -Let's say its 'INT' then my scenario would hold true? If not, then should we request a change in the spec to change it from IVL_PQ to PQ?<br>\nI have that in the C-CDA implementation guide R2.1 (US Realm) and also the latest CDA archiecture page for FHIR.<br>\n<a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cda-core-2.0//StructureDefinition-SubstanceAdministration.html\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cda-core-2.0//StructureDefinition-SubstanceAdministration.html</a></p>",

        "content": "<p>If it's INT, then it should map to MedicationRequest - which we use to expose proposals, plans and orders.  And MedicationRequest supports Range as well as PQ - the former has both low and high values and maps well to IVL_PQ.</p>",

    {
        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  , this can lead to some confusion, I mean typically in a Medication activity template - we have the provision to nest Medication supply order template as well. Medication supply order maps to MedicationRequest resource in FHIR. So in principle for a given instance of substance administration in C-CDA we can have a parent MedicationRequest resource and a derived MedicationRequest resource.  My understanding of C-CDA Medication Activity template was that INT mood of substance administration simply reflected an intent to administer a medication and was not same as  ordering a medication. If both are same when the moodCode is INT, there can be conflicts while converting it to FHIR. Also, shouldn't there be a clear guideline/specification with respect to these kind of edge cases.</p>",
