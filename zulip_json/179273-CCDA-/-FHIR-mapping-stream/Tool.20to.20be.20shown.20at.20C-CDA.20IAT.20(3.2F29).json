If you have a chance to check it out today, it's currently hosted here: <a href=\"http://ccda.online/\">http://ccda.online/</a> (note that the URL we use long-term will likely change). If you have an example of something already mapped in CDA to FHIR and can play with it, please let me know if it works. It's very much an alpha/beta tool right now</p>",
