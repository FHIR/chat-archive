For example, for Problems, are you referring to whether or not the condition has been resolved?  e.g. '<em>The effectiveTime of the Problem Observation is the definitive indication of whether or not the underlying condition is resolved. If the problem is known to be resolved, then an effectiveTime/high would be present. If the date of resolution is not known, then effectiveTime/high will be present with a nullFlavor of \"UNK\".</em> '  And/or the optional Problem Status observation (2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.6)?  Or something else?  </p>\n<p>Also, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192205\">@Lisa Nelson</span> or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191407\">@Rick Geimer</span> may be aware of published guidelines/business rules that I am not.</p>",

Yes, I meant the status of the problem is 'active' or'inactive' or  'resolved' etc. Similarly I meant for allergy where status of the allergy could be 'active' or 'inactive' etc.  I do understand the rules like -\" If the problem is known to be resolved, then an effectiveTime/high would be present. If the date of resolution is not known, then effectiveTime/high will be present with a nullFlavor of \"UNK\". \" But my question is related to verficationStatus that accompanies the 'status' field in 'Condition' or 'AllergyIntolerance' resource. How do we infer the verificationStatus while mapping the C-CDA elements from 'Problem' or' Allergy ' to FHIR resources Condition and AllergyIntolerance. I hope I am making sense.</p>",
