In the past, I pointed the validator at the fhir-cda/resources/structuredefinition to get the CDA logical model, but you removed that directory and now you can't point the validator at just the resources directory because of the directories and other things in there.  Can you clue me in on how you're running the transformations?  thanks.</p>",
