That makes sense.  In other words, in addition to EHR, I may have 100's of healthcare analytics running based on user defined metrics derived from several EHR data sources (non-FHIR standards) by mapping those EHR data source elements that is  found to be a match with FHIR R4 resources and profiles, etc.). EHR elements that no match found in FHIR, is followed by creating FHIR extension, and they can still be FHIR Compliant (conformant). I am assuming that is correct? Finally,  who (person(s)) or what FHIR committee's or FHIR council's  we need to go through to get the FHIR conformant statement of interoperability? Is there an FHIR email address or contacts for the FHIR compliance folks? How do we as a company can PUBLISH A FHIR CAPABILITY STATEMENT?</p>",

Attribution or \"assignment\" is a key program methodology used to identify the members associated with a PCP and Payer during a course of time, preferable over a period of month.

It does imply, that if we choose to use \"extension mechanism\" we would not directly tie it to the resource \"ATTRIBUTION\", as it does not exist in FHIR.
