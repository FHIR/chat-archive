Independently, the .NET API has gained support parsing for the CDA models and corresponding instances over the last two weeks. However, we pulled the models for testing the API before this change. Changing the types to use \"-\" would introduce a some ugly mapping tables /rules for these specific types. +1 for the PR from my side</p>",
