How do we resolve the search parameters type discrepancies?</p>\n<p>Few search parameters have the input type defined as token, however the data stored in the DB is in the form of String or Boolean. <br>\nFor example: In the patient resource, \"active\" is a boolean field, and the input for the parameter is token type.<br>\nSimilarly for parameter gender input type is token and the data is stored in the form of string. </p>\n<p>Search Parameter Link: (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html#search\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html#search\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html#search</a>)<br>\nToken Format Link: (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#token\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#token\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#token</a>)</p>\n<p>Q2. How do we compare date and quantity type objects? It is time consuming to compare in the nested JSON fields?</p>\n<p>Q3. How we address, for some of the composite functions which require search in two fields along with comparison of quantities?</p>\n<p>For example: In MedicationRequest Resource DosageInstruction is a list that has event timings for every object. </p>\n<p>Composite type Link: (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#composite\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#composite\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#composite</a>)<br>\nQuantity type Link: (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#quantity\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#quantity\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#quantity</a>)</p>",
