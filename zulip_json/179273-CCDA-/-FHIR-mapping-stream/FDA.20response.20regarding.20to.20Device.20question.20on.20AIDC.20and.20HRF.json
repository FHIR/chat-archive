The AIDC technology may be a bar code or any other technology that conveys the UDI or DI in a form that can be entered into an electronic patient record or other computer system via an automated process.</p>\n<p>If you have additional questions regarding UDI,or about the information found in the barcode, please submit them to the FDA UDI Help Desk. </p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Consumer Safety Officer<br>\nIndustry Team<br>\nDivision of Industry and Consumer Education <br>\nOffice of Communication and Education<br>\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health<br>\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration</p>",
