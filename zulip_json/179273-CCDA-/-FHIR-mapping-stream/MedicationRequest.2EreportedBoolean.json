I guess you were referring to the base model CDA specs. My apologies for not quoting the exact CDA spec I was refering to. I am referring to the CDA R2.1 (US Realm) -where they have a constrained set of elements specified and the reporter is not present in it. However, another point that came to my mind is that -What-if the author is NOT a provider. Hence , it would be essential to constrain the rule to be  such that <a href=\"http://Author.id\">Author.id</a> SHALL be a provider identifier like NPI (National Provider Identifier - as used in US)</p>",
