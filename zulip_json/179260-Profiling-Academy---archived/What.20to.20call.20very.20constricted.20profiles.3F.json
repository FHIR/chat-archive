I have just started my master thesis which is focused on FHIR and specifically the opportunities of FHIR profiling in Sweden. I will for example discuss profiles on a national level and profiles on more organizational levels. I came across the term tight and loose profiles. To me, a tight profile would be a profile which is very constricted and would be hard to create derived profiles from since there is not much room for more constrictions. My question is, does the terms tight and loose for describing profiles exist or are there other terms that would be better to use for this purpose?</p>",
