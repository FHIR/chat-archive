So, we are planning to create an extension to capture our custom status. Having said that we do not want to use the status field which is required as per the spec. Can any one guide how to deal with this kind of situation? Is it expected to populate some value in status even though it does not carry any significance or is there a way to drop that in the profile? (We are using fsh and we get below error)<br>\nCardinality constraints cannot widen the cardinality.  0..0 is wider than 1..1.</p>",
