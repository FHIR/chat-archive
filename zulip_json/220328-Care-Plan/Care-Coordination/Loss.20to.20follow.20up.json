For example, an inpatient admission with follow-up home care  services may make up one episode of care. A year later, if the patient is admitted for another inpatient stay and follow up homecare services that is a second completely different \"episode of care\". Even billing occurs based on this context. Whereas with care planning, the patient may have a chronic illness that may end up needing multiple episodes of care that can occur as long as the patient has the illness and planning occurs to deal with the illness. The main need for care plan is to collect and coordinate the various care processes (which contain \"episodes of care\").</p>",

But the CarePlan _can_ be used as a record, with more context than either EpisodeOfCare, Encounter or simpler resources (typically: Observation),  as shown by the inclusion of e.g. activity.outcome[CodeableConcept/Reference]. And personally, I think this is potentially a useful richer context for the record - and I'm not too fond of putting that responsibility to EpisodeOfCare.
