        "content": "<p>I am currently working on a project for a client (payor) that has an proprietary recommendation engine for patients. We are exposing the recomendations through the patient-view CDS-hook. We will have a SMART on FHIR application that manages the recommendations for the patient including the status of various requests that may happen (we want communications to patients, 3rd party program enrollments and other activities that we will want to track). Rather than deal with the proprietary database, we are proposing a FHIR facade to the recommendation database. I believe exposing these recommendations (and associated activities, communications and 3rd party enrollments) using CarePlan is appropropriate. Since these recommendations are from a Payor, the provider does have the ability to override and/or ignore them. Given that the provider may override or ignore, CarePlan would still be the appropriate resource for this facade?</p>",
