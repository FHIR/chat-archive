CPG-on-FHIR is at low maturity but is part of a larger, coherent framework with computable conformance related to evidence, appropriate measurement (eCQM), clinical decision support, etc.</p>\n<p>Thank you for bringing your questions here.  I'm learning a lot from Gay, Emma and Rene that you have stimulated.</p>",
