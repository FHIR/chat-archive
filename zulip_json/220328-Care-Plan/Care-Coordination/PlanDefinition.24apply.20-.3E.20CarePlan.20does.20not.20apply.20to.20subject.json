My question is how have people implemented or what is the guidance on implementing $apply and returning a CarePlan which does not apply to the subject? The specification indicates that I return a CarePlan with a single activity that is a RequestGroup. But if the CarePlan does not apply to the passed in subject, how should I represent that? Is changing my return value from CarePlan to OperationOutcome appropriate? Also, from an http status perspective, would 404 be appropriate as the result wasn't found or would 200/204 be more appropriate since the operation succeeded, it just did not happen to apply to my subject?</p>",

You may want to provide additional rationale for that, perhaps in the description element or a note, to say that the service produced no guidance fpr this patient because they did not meet the inclusion criteria (or that they did meet the exclusion criteria), but a CarePlan that says \"nothing to do because X\" still seems like a useful (and successful) result.</p>",
