They contain content that was not possible to assign to a committee<br>\nresources: 1 file per resource. Each file needs to be examined bu the owning committee only (you know who you are!)<br>\nterminology: 1 file per committee.  Also has datatypes for FHIR-I (so they don't feel under appreciated)</p>\n<p>You should have view access to the files - I suggest you download the ones that apply to you and open in a local copy of word.</p>\n<p>They aren'y all here yet - I'll poke the reviewers. Deadline for applying changes is December 2nd...</p>\n<p>Reply here if there are any issues.</p>\n<p>happy applying!</p>",
