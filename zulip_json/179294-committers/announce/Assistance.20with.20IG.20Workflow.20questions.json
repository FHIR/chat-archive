I.e. how is FHIR used when orchestrating business processes, exchanging data between systems, asking for activity to occur, etc.  There's a <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/workflow.html\">section</a> in the core specification dedicated to this.  As well, the workflow project has a <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179196-workflow\" title=\"#narrow/stream/179196-workflow\">stream</a> here on <a href=\"http://chat.fhir.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://chat.fhir.org\">chat.fhir.org</a> and we have weekly conference calls on Mondays from 2-3 Eastern.  We invite projects developing IGs that have questions around workflow or that are implementing \"novel\" workflows to share what they're up to and/or to ask questions.</p>",
