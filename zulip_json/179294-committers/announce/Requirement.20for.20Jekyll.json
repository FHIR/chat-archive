That means that if you're running a local build prior to pushing your commits to the core spec, you need to be set up to be able to publish FHIR implementation guides too.  (Realisticly, any work group that isn't yet developing implementation guide content will need to do so in the next 1-2 years anyhow.)  In practical terms, that means that all committers will need to install Ruby and Jekyll.
