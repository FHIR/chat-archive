The fix is simple: define these elements in your code systems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>content = complete or example (for HL7 IGs, anything else will require approval by HTA)</li>\n<li>caseSensitive=true (for HL7 IGs, anything else will require approval by ?TSMG)</li>\n<li>hierarchyMeaning=is-a - If and only if you have a hierarchy (concepts that contain concepts). If you don't, don't populate the hierarchyMeaning element and you won't get a warning if you don't. (for HL7 IGs, If you want a value other than 'is-a', you need vocabulary approval)</li>\n</ul>",
