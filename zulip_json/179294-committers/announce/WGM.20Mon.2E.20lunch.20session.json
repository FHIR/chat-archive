The focus of this particular session will be IG templates.  We're in the process of migrating the IG development process to us a standard HL7-defined template which should simplify some of the development process and also increase consistency in the look &amp; feel of HL7-produced IGs.  As we do that, we have the opportunity to introduce changes/improvements in the way the content of our IGs is consumed (filenames, file organization, types of files used) as well as in how the resulting IGs look (colors, fonts, layouts, representations, etc.)  We're soliciting feedback as well as examples of what you'd like to see - both what you want to keep as well as proposed changes.</p>\n<p>Grab your lunch before you come.</p>",
