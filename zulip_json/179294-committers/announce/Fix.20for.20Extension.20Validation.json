Not any more... it now flags these as invalid and checks the inner non-absolute URLs (they must be defined by the extension definition or they are invalid)</p>\n<p>If this creates new errors in your IGs that are up for publishing, we will not hold them up for this. But you should fix any errors that arise if you can</p>",
