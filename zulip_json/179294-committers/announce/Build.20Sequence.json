When a full runs, the specification is built, and then extensive testing is performed around validation and IG publication, both to ensure that all the examples are valid, and that the packaging, validation and publication infrastructure is functional. The full validation takes about 20min. </p>\n<p>In the future, the extensive testing/validation won't happen for the build that happens <em>after</em> a PR is approved. This will speed up the time to publication. It does open a very tiny window for merge problems to create failures that slip through the build, but we will deal with that if it happens</p>",
