We are doing a recirculation ballot on this that closes Dec 25th.</p>\n<p>Publication: We still want to publish prior to Dec 31. (It's really hard for me to do the days of work this entails to execute the machinery after Jan 1 - I'm on the road till end of Feb). With that in mind, we are submitting a publication request to TSC on the 17th. This means the all changes are to be done by midnight on 14th, giving me time on the 15th to clean up anything, and then TSC have the weekend to do review. </p>\n<p>So committers schedule for R4:<br>\n- Committers should be closing out QA input and doing technical QA. <br>\n- in particular, committers should check the R3/R4 mappings in the next few days<br>\n- We will go to full freeze midnight eastern 13th - any PRs after that require my approval <br>\n- I will not approve any PRs from other committers after midnight 14th, at which time I will change the version to 4.0.0<br>\n- freeze will come off after Christmas once ballot passes.</p>",
