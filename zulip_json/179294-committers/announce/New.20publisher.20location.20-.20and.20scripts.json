Which means that the script that goes and <em>grabs</em> the current IGPublisher needs to be different.  While we were at it, we changed the updatePublisher batch file to replace itself with the most recent copy of the updatePublisher.bat (if you say 'y' when it prompts you), so it should be easier to keep up to date going forward.  (Right now it only replaces the updatePublisher.bat, but soon will replace all the standard scripts - we wanted feedback before we started doing that in case anyone typically customizes theirs.)  Please grab the current updatePublisher.bat (and other scripts) from their maintenance location on github in the sample IG: <a href=\"https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig\" title=\"https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig\">https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig</a></p>\n<p>Side note: we don't yet have auto-update support for the .sh files.  Volunteers welcome...</p>\n<p>Discussion on the committers stream please.</p>",
