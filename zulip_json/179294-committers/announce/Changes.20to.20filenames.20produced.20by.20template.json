        "content": "<p>The standard HL7 template has been updated to use a standard naming convention of [type]-[id] for all files generated as part of the build process.  In the past, some (but not all) StructureDefinition files took on the name of [id] or extension-[id] (mirroring how the core build handles naming).  This created inconsistency and confusion - and there were also discrepancies in that some profile filenames used the standard [type]-[id] naming convention and some didn't.  The impact of this is that if you have narrative, markdown or XHTML text that hyperlinks to particular profile pages, you may find that these links are now broken when you build using the newest template.  You'll need to change your hyperlinks to reflect the new naming convention.  For those not using the new template publication approach, there will be no impact yet.  (You'll need to worry about fixing your links when you move to the template.)</p>",
