This new release does a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adds next/previous and top/bottom links to every page in the IG</li>\n<li>adds links to CSV and Excel representations of all structure definitions</li>\n<li>adds support for a 'dragon' class for divs which will allow you to put 'here be dragons' sections in your IGs in the same manner we have them in the core spec</li>\n<li>ensures that Provenance artifacts that are included in the IG to provide history don't show up in the artifacts list or table of contents</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have any issues, please make sure you're running 1.1.72 or newer before reporting them.</p>",
