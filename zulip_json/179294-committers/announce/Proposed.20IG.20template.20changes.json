This shouldn't affect most users of the templates.  However, if you've customized the groupings.txt file to provide custom names or descriptions or have manually asserted groupings based on the 'standard' ids, this change will break your templates and/or ids.  (I did not call for comments on this change as thee was no choice but to change given that the current functionality is non-conformant.  You can revert to a  formal release of the base templates if necessary if you have urgent publication requirements.)</p>",
