We've had some challenges with different work groups following different rules for deciding what should be included vs. not.  Some felt that the 80% rule applied (so only list a type if there's a belief that 'most' existing systems support the type), while others followed a looser set of expectations.</p>\n<p>The outcome of the methodology discussion is as follows:<br>\n<code>The bar for including a type in a choice is lower than the \"80% rule\" because the cost of a type being omitted is higher.  Types should be included if the WG can foresee a reasonable likelihood of a type being used in a production system for the specific data element.</code></p>\n<p>To give a concrete example, even if very few systems allow patients to author MedicationRequest instances, 'Patient' should still be a target of the 'subject' element because there's a reasonable likelihood of that being allowed by at least some systems.  The term \"reasonable likelihood\" means that you don't have to allow totally ludicrous use-cases, merely those where there's a reasonable chance of them showing up in real systems.</p>\n<p>If there are questions/concerns, please discuss on <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179165\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179165-committers\">#committers</a>.</p>",
