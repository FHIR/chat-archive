The FHIR Package Registry is indeed really meant to find the FHIR package you need based on a bunch of filters. Like, <a href=\"https://registry.fhir.org/results?latestFilter=true&amp;jurisdictionFilter=%5B%22urn%3Aiso%3Astd%3Aiso%3A3166%23US%22%5D&amp;resourceFilter=%5B%22ValueSet%22%5D&amp;query=%22covid%22\">packages for the US realm containing a ValueSet related to Covid</a>.<br>\nAnd just to be sure, the resource filter 'Patient' will currently give you (packages containing) <em>instances</em> of Patient, not profiles on Patient. For that you will need the filter on instances of StructureDefinition (which profiles are) and there currently is no way to explicitly filter on the base type.</p>\n<p>What's the use case behind your question? Are you looking to find specific patient profiles, or do you really need all Patient profiles ever published in a FHIR package to run statistics on them?</p>",

I'd also suggest keyword filtering so I can find other Patient profiles related to \"genetics\" or \"covid\".</p>",
