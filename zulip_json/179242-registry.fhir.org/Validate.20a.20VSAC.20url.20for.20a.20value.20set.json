In part to begin the discussion, it would be helpful to know what is necessary to demonstrate a validity. But without getting to far into the weeds, what are thoughts on this?</p>",

I want to validate the extensions and valuesets in the profile (hence the VSAC question above)<br>\n4. I want to initially create instance data using the profile using non-PHI test scenarios.

This tests the profile for \"fit for purpose.\" I want to be able to validate my resource instances against the profile. I'm working out some kinks with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191321\">@David Hay</span> <br>\n5. I want to use one of the FHIR libraries to programatically create large volumes of synthetic data based on the profiles, so I can test my application.</p>\n<p>With each of the above steps, I envision a feedback loop that potentially<br>\na.
