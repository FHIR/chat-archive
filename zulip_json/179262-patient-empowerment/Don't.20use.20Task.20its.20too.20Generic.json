Pushing back, you really can't get more generic than Observation.  And I see Observation implemented in many of the EHR's APIs but it doesn't support every kind of observation.  The EHRs say that.  You can say I support these types (which perhaps happen to have terminology codes behind them).</p>",

Years ago I crossed paths with the Online Dispute Resolution people, whose <a href=\"http://odr.info/mission\">ODR.info</a> site has grown into the National Center for <em>Technology</em> and Dispute Resolution. I've been telling them for years that they should watch our space.</p>\n<p>Two interesting things happened once laws were passed saying that credit card companies have to eat the damage, to some extent, if they're too lax to prevent fraud.  (I may have specifics wrong but that's the gist.)  First, the companies got <em>real</em> tight on fraud prevention - all the improvements in card security, PINs, rapid detection of questionable transactions, etc.  Second, they got really interested in processing disputes efficiently, and an industry sprung up, specializing in it, which led eventually to ODR.</p>\n<p>I won't be surprised if something similar happens in health records over the next 5, 10, 20 years.</p>",
