The end result seems to be to reinforce the need for the patient to act as data mule.  (And for unreasonable costs to be imposed when the target recipient doesn't trust the patient as a data mule.)</p>\n<p>Caveat - I'm a Canadian and not a lawyer, so my interpretation doesn't much count :&gt;</p>",
