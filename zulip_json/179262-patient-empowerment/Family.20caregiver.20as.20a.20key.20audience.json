I'm sure <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191678\">@Abigail Watson</span>  and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"225094\">@Debi Willis</span> could add to the list, but some who come to mind are Amy Gleason's CareSync (for her daughter Morgan, who today has 23 portals, as I mentioned recently) and Lifetime Health Diary (MaryAnn Sterling).</p>\n<p>It's essential to note that unlike people who are in it to make a killing (so to speak) financially, these people have a job to do that's really important to them.
