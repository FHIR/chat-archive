So giving an ability to capture 'story', but also can use the 'story' bit to capture metrics both about a patient's \"level of function\" in every day life, possibly along multiple axis as well as drilling down to capture specific symptoms.  Ideally an app could be tuned to present the metrics and symptoms most relevant to a particular condition as well as most relevant to a particular patient, based on past responses (while still allowing people to capture 'new' things that they notice and feel are important).  The data elements would ideally be mapped to standardized clinical terminologies and FHIR resources to make it easy to take the results and expose them in a way that clinical and research systems can easily consume.  Patients could choose whether to track their data for personal use, share with specific providers, grant anonymized access for research purposes, etc.</p>\n<p>This wouldn't be an 'easy' project, but I think it's a completely <em>doable</em> project.  Creating one-off, disease-specific solutions isn't very efficient and results in a lot of re-inventing the wheel.  If we could come up with a generic solution with good mobile and web-based clients that the public could work to translate to different languages and cultures, the energy creating lots of little semi-functional solutions could instead support and enhance a general-purpose better scaling and more capable solution</p>",

We have actually been working on this problem for some time. </p>\n<p>TLDR VERSION: WE HAVE BUILT A SURVER BUILDER APP THAT DOES A LOT OF WHAT DAVE AND LLOYD PUT DOWN IN THEIR WISH LIST ABOVE FOR HANNAH WEI AND COVID PATIENT RESEARCH. IT IS A POC, BUT IT WORKS PRETTY WELL. WE WANT TO MAKE IT BETTER. IF OF INTEREST, READ ON BELOW WHAT IT DOES, AND PLEASE JOIN US! WE WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP DEVELOPMENT WITH THE COMMUNITY. </p>\n<p>We have built a POC that works fine and does most of what you are describing, but we want to keep developing it to make it better for all researchers and all subjects. We call it simply “The Survey Builder” (TSB). It is fully FHIR and SNOMED CT compliant, so all data relationships captured can be easily compared / analyzed with other researchers (whether COVID or any other researchers). We used FHIR R4 with SDC and Snowstorm Terminology Server. </p>\n<p>For a bit of fun last night we used TSB to replicate the first 21 questions of @hannah COVID-19 Patient Experience Survey #2 and it worked well. Because we “live” in it we see some current limitations but it provides a good base for what you are describing above. </p>\n<p>Thanks to Dave’s introduction I have been in contact with Hannah and we look forward to showing her what her team’s COVID survey looks like on TSB, as it seems to hit many of her key requirements: The researcher can create survey sets of questions that have value sets and rules tuned to specific conditions or fact-finding surveys. </p>\n<p>It is simple for patients to enter data and they can see their data because it is in their instance of the app, and it has the capacity for patient-friendly terms to be used as well as professional terms, and of course it has the underlying SNOMED CT codes, plus FHIR resources of course, so patients can easily communicate their symptoms and experiences to medical professionals AND machines. </p>\n<p>Plus the structured data can flow both ways, so the patients (let’s call them “Data Owners” – after all it is their data), can get the data and also results back too. The app is designed specifically for back and forth Data Owner / Clinician / Researcher interaction. </p>\n<p>And this may also be interesting; the data structure in the app is designed to build on what the Data Owner has previously entered. I am not sure exactly what format and type of data / reports Hannah wants to feed back to their patients, but the app is designed to be a two-way data share, so I imagine most things should be doable. </p>\n<p>And since the data entered by the Data Owner is owned by them in their own instance of the app, the data can be explicitly permissioned by them to share as they see fit, wherever they wish it go. This can also significantly lessen Custodial Data worries that providers typically have about receiving patient data that the patient may not have explicitly given consent for a particular research use case or analysis. </p>\n<p>Oh, and the TSB works on web or mobile.</p>",
