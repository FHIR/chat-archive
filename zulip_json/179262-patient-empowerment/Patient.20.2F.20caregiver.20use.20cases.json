        "content": "<p>PROPOSED PATIENT USES CASES, from <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194480\">@Mark Braunstein</span>  [I severely failed in my promise to post this for him two weeks ago!]</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Finding a use case that lots of people would have a use for is, in my opinion, the real challenge in the patient informatics space.  People have been at it for a long time and, so far as I know, no one has found one  yet.  However, there have always been serious problems with getting medical data to patients (in most early PHRs they had to type it in themselves and even with the advent of CDAs it was fairly complicated).   FHIR provides a solution to that as Apple has demonstrated.  </p>\n<p>I have an Android phone but using 1UpHealth I merely had to register and select my health system from a list and enter my portal credentials and -- like magic -- my records were there in the app and I could play with the information.  &lt;=[BlueButton data, if I understand correctly - Dave]</p>\n<p>To be honest, I didn't find what I could do with the information particularly enlightening but that's been the case with every PHR I've tried and its clear 1UpHealth has not (at least not yet) focused on what patients might do with the information. A few thoughts on that off the top of my head (yes, the last one is pretty 'far out'):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It should be no surprise that Apple featured MedSafe in their announcement that they are now supporting FHIR apps (of course they didn't use those words).  It takes advantage of FHIR to make it truly easy for a patient to created a medication calendar that is specific to their schedule.  In other words the physician wrote 'take twice a day' but what that actually means is different for each patient.  Since medications are the mainstay of treatment for chronic disease and since chronic disease is 90+ % of healthcare if there is a 'silver bullet' it might well be around medication management.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I hate to go there because I'm a social networking Luddite but I suppose an app that helps patients connect with similar patients (using EHR data that could be quite specific - diabetics with similar demographics and levels of control and taking similar meds for example).  PatientsLikeMe currently dominates that space but if you put medical records in the hands of patients they could create their own networks using criteria they develop.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, an idea I actually first heard over 20 years ago.  Patient data is valuable but patients don't get any value from its sale and use.  Many years ago I met an original thinker in this space (sadly departed now) who envisioned 'health data banks' into which patients could 'deposit' their data and share in the returns generated by the aggregate sale of that data to pharma, insurance companies and whoever else might have a legitimate use for it.  Put patient data into phones using FHIR and you've taken a giant step toward that vision.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>",

You can watch the rest of this video and others if you want, but the first 30-40 seconds here illustrate the truly \"patient power\" world that I envision. <br>\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/FZK7JllMPLM?t=605\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://youtu.be/FZK7JllMPLM?t=605\">https://youtu.be/FZK7JllMPLM?t=605</a> </p>\n<p>Note that I'm not specifically talking here about getting data out of EHRs  - to the contrary, earlier in the video he says \"What’s changing is that the data about you as an individual is being accumulated by you, outside the doctor’s office … this is only going to increase until 99.9% of the data about you is outside the medical record. At that point we are going to have complete disruption of the way medicine is practiced.”</p>\n<p>My point is, as Smarr says, that the future world we envision includes gobs and gobs of data that some of us will want to do things with, so please, <strong>whatever you/we do, leave the door wide open for patients and their advocates to get every bit of data</strong> so they/we can do whatever we want with it. </p>\n<p>Don't be limited by any traditional <strong>physician</strong> use case.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"FZK7JllMPLM\" href=\"https://youtu.be/FZK7JllMPLM?t=605\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://youtu.be/FZK7JllMPLM?t=605\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FZK7JllMPLM/default.jpg\"></a></div>",
