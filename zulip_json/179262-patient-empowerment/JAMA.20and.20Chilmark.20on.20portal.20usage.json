Some of us in the patient community are incensed that normally smart people in the medical community are so BLIND to the behavioral reality that if a portal contains very little info, consumers will have little reason to use it!  </p>\n<p>And what's really \"incensing\" about it is that ten years ago when this all started, those same forces (basically establishment medicine) insisted that portals be LIMITED to displaying very little information. </p>\n<p>This is a close parallel to the recent wars on social media about physicians hating EMR usability, and therefore hating the governments that mandated them (\"This is all Obama's fault\").  I was present in DC in 2010 when some EMR industry lobbyists were forcefully OBJECTING to the people in the Obama administration who wanted usability to be a criterion for an acceptable system.</p>",
