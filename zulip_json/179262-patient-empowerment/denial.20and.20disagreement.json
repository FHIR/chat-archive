A good example of this is Conditions which are sent everywhere and are part of reconciliation.  If a patient disagrees with a condition on their medical record, how will the clinician who is receiving a patient know what some of the data they are getting from another site is contested by the patient?   One site I talked to also stores the patient request and the proof of correction or the patient request and the denial and disagreement as documents.  However, it did not seem that the data was necessarily accessible at a useful point in the workflow.</p>",
