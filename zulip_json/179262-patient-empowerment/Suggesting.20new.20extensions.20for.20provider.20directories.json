This API must be accessible via a public-facing digital endpoint on the payerâ€™s website. To facilitate this, we link to the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net IG\"</p>\n<p>So here is the idea:  what if, as part of these provider directories, insurers would provide not just the name, location, contactinfo, and \"accepting new patients\" status of each provider, but also \"whether they support electronic interchange of health information\"?  is anyone doing this yet?  has anyone considered it?  is it worth pursuing?</p>",

As such, those vendors are able to publish <strong>authoritative lists</strong> describing the endpoints in their network, allowing others to the discover, connect, and build on top. Indeed, anyone can take these independent endpoint lists and compile them into an  aggregated list, but the secret is that for this to be successful you need to actually add value (making sure it stays up to date with the sources with very little lag, reconciling any formatting difference is, annotating with additional data, etc). ONC is requiring more publication at the vendor level, and maybe once there's more than a few lists to scrape, aggregating content will become a more attractive proposition. But again, discovery is not the hard part. Today everyone who actually has a wide network has made it discoverable. The problem is that most have no network.</p>",
