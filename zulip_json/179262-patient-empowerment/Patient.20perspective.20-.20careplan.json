The DCP FHIR implementation guide constrains the patient element as required (1..1) in the care plan structure definition.<br>\nThe DCP IG is meant to be for the patientâ€™s use by providing the structures and transactions patients can use for participating in and for  planning their care. It can also be used for creating, updating and sharing their Care Plans.<br>\nDCP IG provides the ability to target appropriate services and to coordinate care over time, across multiple clinicians and sites of service, with the engagement of the patient (i.e., longitudinal coordination of care). This is essential to alleviating fragmented, duplicative and costly (direct and indirect) care.<br>\nWith the recent integration of the DCP IG with care team management, DCP enables the patient to coordinate, direct and participate in the provision of care as an integral care team member, including role as care team lead when needed.</p>",
