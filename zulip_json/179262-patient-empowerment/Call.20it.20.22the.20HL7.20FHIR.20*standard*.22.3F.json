A company? A conspiracy? No, it's a standard, not unlike HTML (or something).</p>\n<p>What do others think?  My perspective is largely informed by working in consumer marketing, where it's important to treat a brand as an ADJECTIVE, e.g. \"Sanka brand decaffeinated coffee.\"  My perspective is not necessarily the most useful one, so - what do you think?</p>",

(It's also a 'standard' in the practical sense - large numbers of implementers in many places are aligning their interfaces to it.)
