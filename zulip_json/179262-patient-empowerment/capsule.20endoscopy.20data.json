So I googled the instruction manual for the monitoring unit and discovered that I can view real-time images from the PillCam on the monitoring unit. Very cool! I wish I had a way to capture all <strong>my</strong> data to my computer. Of course I don't want to monkey with things too much and risk messing up the recording process.</p>",
