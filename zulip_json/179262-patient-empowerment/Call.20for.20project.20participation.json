We have two projects that we think your insight would be really helpful on - Patient Contributed Data and Patient Corrections - and would be honored if you would consider joining our efforts in some capacity.  These project groups meet on Mondays Eastern - 12 for patient contributed data and 3 for patient corrections.</p>",
