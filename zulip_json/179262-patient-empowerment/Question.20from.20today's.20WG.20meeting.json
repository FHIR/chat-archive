Please give feedback on what this should actually say in our minutes. I know I got this wrong:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Part of the mandate of this WG is to let \"civilians\" engage in the standards process. A second part of the mandateÂ is ... ... more meta? Making sure the right data gets to the right place, from the patient POV. \"Maximize the chances that the solution you come up with will be adopted and achieve the goal everyone wants\"</p>\n</blockquote>",

Our second mandate is to specifically provide advice to (and sometimes lead) the development of standards where aspects of them <em>are</em> patient/care-giver facing.  Overall, what we're trying to do with standards the standards development process is maximize the set of diverse viewpoints that provide feedback during the development process to maximize the suitability, longevity, adoption and value that the resulting standard has.  Injecting the patient/caregiver perspective across the spectrum of the HL7 organization helps us do that.</p>",
