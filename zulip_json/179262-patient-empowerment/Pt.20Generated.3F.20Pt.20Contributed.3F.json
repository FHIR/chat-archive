In the Patient Empowerment WG call right now, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"256347\">@Jan Oldenburg</span> is leading a discussion of terminology, and we wonder what you personally and ONC think about the difference.</p>\n<p>Our concern: the ONC <strong>definition</strong> matches what we believe (anything that comes from the patient), but in PRACTICE, we find providers often really don't want to hear about it - they think of PGHD as only home digital devices: bathroom scale, Fitbit data, etc.  It's the classic issue of \"We don't trust anything from anyone but our own doctors, even when they're wrong.\"  Except when the patient / family knows they're right, it's a PROBLEM clinically.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"256347\">@Jan Oldenburg</span> will improve what I just said I'm sure.</p>",
