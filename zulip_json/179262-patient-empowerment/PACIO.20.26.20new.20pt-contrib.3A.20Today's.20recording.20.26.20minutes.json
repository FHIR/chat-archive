Highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pt Contributed Data discussion</strong> starts around 4:40.<ul>\n<li>Important distinctions in minutes below, particularly a Zulip thread about \"patient writeback\" to EHRs, and that the scope of our work (like all of FHIR) is far broader than just EHRs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>@</strong>Dave Hill<strong> 's rich, broad PACIO presentation</strong> starts at 21:52. (If a virtual meeting could have a standing O, this would have gotten one)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Co-chairs <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191531\">@Virginia Lorenzi</span>  and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"225094\">@Debi Willis</span> were unavailable (though Debi dialed in a bit) so <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"256347\">@Jan Oldenburg</span> led the meeting while I scribed in between headcold moments.</p>",
