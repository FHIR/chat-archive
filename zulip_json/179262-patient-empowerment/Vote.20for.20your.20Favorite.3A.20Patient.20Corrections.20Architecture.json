The Vote is not a ballot clearly its just at this point in time what are you most leaning towards.  We would like to test as early as April and want to prepare for that. At the WGM, we created a list of all the specifying we need to do once we pass this logjam so would like to find a way forward so we can get to those other work items.    Implementers on the server side that actually manage the request for correction workflow are voices we are especially interested in but we do want all.

The opinions/preferences of other participants matter somewhat, but implementers hold the trump cards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I disagree rather strongly with that timeframe.  The assumption of 1-3 years assumes institutional stakeholders that are well resourced and can think in terms of multi-year rollouts.  Patient implementors and the startup community they inhabit, on the other hand, have much shorter runways where they need to be able to prove a prototype, or otherwise their projects will starve, crash, and burn.  Assuming a 1-3 year implementation timeframe might be fine in other areas of HL7, but I think it's egregious to apply that same yard stick to Patient Empowerment activities.   If a Patient Implementor or startup can't implement an IG within 3 months, the IG is effectively worthless.  IG users should NOT have to wait 'a few years down the road' for an IG to be useful.  </p>\n<p>Personally, I'd like to see a motion for the PE Workgroup to constrain itself to only writing IGs that use resources that are Maturity Level 4 or 5 -  meaning that Patient Implementors and other stakeholders who implement the IG can anticipate a higher level of adoption of the spec when they pick the IG up.  That would cut the timeframe to less than a year.  FHIR-I might have the luxury of considering 1-3 year timeframes, but patients and startups generally don't have that luxury.  </p>\n<p>(I realize that such a motion wouldn't get a majority, but it would get my vote.)</p>",

        "content": "<p>I'm not saying the IG can't be done within 3 months, and a start-up could easily do the same.  But I think 1-3 years is realistic (maybe even optimistic) for a timeframe of EHR vendors turning the IG into reality, getting it out into the field and have hospitals and clinics turn it on.</p>\n<p>The maturity level has little bearing on what the EHR vendors can/can't do.  They rolled out lots of level 2 resources in DSTU2 and rolled out quite a few more in R4.  The timeframe isn't driven by the maturity of the resource, it's driven by the difficulty (and prioritization) of integrating the interoperability functionality into whatever layer of their system needs it.  The choice of resource will be driven by \"what works best for the functionality they want to expose - and what the standard says the resource is for\".  (EHR vendors have been remarkably good about trying to align with the documented purposes of the resources they use, even as those definitions evolve.)</p>\n<p>The layer we're talking about in terms of patient corrections isn't a layer that has <em>any</em> interoperability right now (as I understand it), and the priority level of this effort isn't going to be as high as the numerous interfaces that have short-term regulation behind them.  So, we need to listen carefully to what the EHR vendors are willing to do.  Because if the Patient implementers and other stakeholders don't have systems they can actually talk to and drive corrections, we haven't got much.  It took roughly two years from time of commitment to when DSTU2 systems were live and it's been taking roughly the same for R4 interfaces.  I see no reason why patient corrections would be faster (and some unfortunate reasons why it might be slower).</p>\n<p>I agree that faster would be better and if the EHRs say they can have it turned on in hospitals in 6 months, I sure won't complain.  I would, however, be exceptionally surprised.  (And that goes for any interface using any resource at all.)</p>",
