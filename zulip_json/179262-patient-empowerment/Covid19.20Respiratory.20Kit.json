This started off as a smart EMT kit, with the thinking that we would have a FHIR enabled app to track contents of your first-responder bag or medical home supply cabinet.  With Covid19 however, we suddenly have a need to organize respiratory care for first-responders, medical homes, paratransit vehicles, good samaritans, and others.  So the product has pivoted into respiratory care.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/mnRTJSol_7N1mQurJyKQwkwO/Symptomatic-ParamadicKit-Open.png\">Symptomatic-ParamadicKit-Open.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/mnRTJSol_7N1mQurJyKQwkwO/Symptomatic-ParamadicKit-Open.png\" title=\"Symptomatic-ParamadicKit-Open.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/mnRTJSol_7N1mQurJyKQwkwO/Symptomatic-ParamadicKit-Open.png\"></a></div><p>Contents currently include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oxygen tank (over the counter)</li>\n<li>Good Samaritan qualifying O2 regulator</li>\n<li>Single use oxygen mask(s)</li>\n<li>High-flow nasal cannulas</li>\n<li>N99 mask</li>\n<li>Disposable gloves</li>\n<li>Hand sanitizer</li>\n<li>Digital stethoscope</li>\n<li>ECG monitor</li>\n<li>Nighttime blood oxygen monitor</li>\n<li>Portable kit bag</li>\n<li>Supports Apple HealthRecords</li>\n<li>All equipment is FDA Approved</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And here is the bag when it's all packed.

It will support Apple HealthRecords and nighttime monitoring equipment.</p>\n<p>While the physician/paramedic kit is a clinician grade product that will provide routing recommendations to which local hospitals have the greatest bed/ventilator capacity.</p>\n<p>Importantly, this is a way to AVOID putting people on a ventilator, and spreads the respiratory care load, thereby helping to flatten the curve.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, long story short, we're introducing a product that has Break-The-Glass Protocol support on the roadmap.  <span aria-label=\"sunglasses\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f60e\" role=\"img\" title=\"sunglasses\">:sunglasses:</span></p>",
