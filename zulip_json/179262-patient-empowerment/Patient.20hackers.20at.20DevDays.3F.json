We’ll have engineers there (including <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"191339\">Pascal Pfiffner</span>!!)  who can help you realize your patient empowerment dreams. </p>\n<p>It would totally be possible for someone to implement something “on the spot” if they so desired and have some iOS experience. Would also love to see that happen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dare we fantasize about some sort of app challenge, with some nominal-yet-exciting F-Prize?
