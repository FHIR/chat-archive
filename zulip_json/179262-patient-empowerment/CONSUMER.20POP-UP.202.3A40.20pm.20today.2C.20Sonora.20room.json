It's ok if some projects don't expect any patient impact<br>\n- IG quality guidelines should change to mandate the inclusion of a section in each IG that is specifically addressed to the patient community that explains what the purpose of the IG is, how it will influence the care they will receive and how, when relevant, they can take advantage of it directly.</p>",

There was some earlier dialogue on making the consumer-facing apps available in a single, vendor-neutral location. The SMART team has agreed to work with us to do that.
