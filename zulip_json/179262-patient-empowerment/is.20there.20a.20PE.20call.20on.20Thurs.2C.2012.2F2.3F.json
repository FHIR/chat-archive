Call-in info is always on our WG's home page, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/hl7patients\">bit.ly/hl7patients</a></p>\n<p>Rant:  (I hope the following is wrong but everyone I've asked has said this is reality)</p>\n<p>Honestly I have tired of maintaining the stupid HL7 call calendars: the site only allows creating a certain number of meetings in each batch (some number of weeks) and when it expires it can't be extended or even renewed - the system forgets every bit of information so it must all be manually re-entered.  I am sick of it and will no longer make it a source of misery in my life. </p>\n<p>I know HL7 wants to improve public participation.  Infrastructure disgraces like this cannot be tolerated anymore, IMO; as I say, I'm tired of it and will no longer enable its persistence by wasting my effort coping with it.</p>",
