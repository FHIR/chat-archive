I didn't consent to being given the flu.  I didn't consent to abuse or being assaulted.  etc.  As if the remedies that are applied in case of bad actors can also be applied to viruses, bacteria, fellow travelers, old age, etc.  Which the cynic in me thinks is futile.  </p>\n<p>In the broader scheme of things, there's a counter argument to opt-in consent models that travel and entry into defined spaces can act as a type of consent in itself.  You go to a bar, and there's some level of consent to be in the same space as others who are imbibing alcohol.  If you travel by airplane, you're sort of consenting to listen to kids scream and maybe get this year's flu.  And so forth.  </p>\n<p>So, I'm generally in favor of consent/privacy models where a) the patient maintains their own records (ID card, smartphone, dogtags, smart prosthetics, etc), that b) throttle on/off entire channels of data (FHIR resources, perhaps streaming via websockets), that is c) location aware.  That is, the Apple model.</p>\n<p>As such, I'm very interested in NFC and RFID and Bluetooth models of consent.  Consent by proximity, as it were.  </p>\n<p>If done correctly, geofences and geotag perimeters and such could provide automated roll-up packaging for more fine-grained controls, like what Josh is describing above.</p>",
