I am assuming, because we have no heard from you that you will not be playing a server for it - we realize you are all over the place.  But please correct me if I am wrong! We would love you to!!!  Our kickoff is at 3PM PT today and you simply need to be able to have some test patients and support Task.</p>\n<p>However, we very much hope you can make room on your schedule for our THURSDAY 2PM PT GUEST EXPERT PANEL moderated by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197491\">@Dave deBronkart</span>  where we will be talking more about the problem from people who try to correct records today.  I think we will all learn and we would love your perspectives.   Also, our report out for the Request for Corrections Track is planned for Friday at 3PM.</p>\n<p>You can follow along on our chat: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179262-patient-empowerment/topic/Connectathon26.20-.20Patient.20Request.20for.20Corrections\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179262-patient-empowerment/topic/Connectathon26.20-.20Patient.20Request.20for.20Corrections</a></p>\n<p>Also, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191678\">@Abigail Watson</span> will be experimenting (separate from the Jan 21 request for corrections track which is focused on the task oriented request process) with any write-back capabilities you have provided on your open APIS that patients could use (PUTs/POSTs/PATCHs to resources).   We are excited about what we will learn from this process as well.</p>",
