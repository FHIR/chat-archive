We want to push through to get the charter document finalized, and we need some HL7-savvy experienced eyeballs to help with questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are we finished?  i.e. is this already a great charter?</li>\n<li>Does each bullet in the draft charter need to talk explicitly about word products &amp; contributions?</li>\n<li>For the few remaining comments in that google doc, what's needed vs \"nice-to-have\", given that charters get updated anyway as time goes by?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So we hope you'll be there on the call :-)</p>",
