        "content": "<p>Hello,<br>\nBased on my experiences to date building one of these Task servers, I would like to submit the following CodeSystem for consideration for Task.businessStatus.    The CodeSystem below is based off of IETF RFC2616 and IETF RFC 7231, with custom 6xx codes from 45 CFR §164.526 (a)(1).  This approach allows automated mapping to existing API endpoints which the Task resource may overlap with, while also allowing for file room clerks and clinicians to update records manually.   It also provides a great deal of specificity of error edge cases which the HIPAA/GDPR workflows are likely to encounter, regardless of which FHIR resource or URI endpoint is being used.  </p>\n<p>I am providing the CodeSystem via JSON and Word document, and will be uploading it to the reference server next week unless anybody else has an alternative proposal.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/FlGyVETyjk-9NcOKCCt-yQJ0/CodeSystem.hipaa-http-business-status-mapping.json\">CodeSystem.hipaa-http-business-status-mapping.json</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/xbtz4xcZDhD1i_1s0XNen-H5/Proposed-CodeSystem-for-HIPAA-GDPR-Correction-Requests.docx\">Proposed-CodeSystem-for-HIPAA-GDPR-Correction-Requests.docx</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/mzdFDVBSS7RjWhWNZEuvRnnn/Proposed-CodeSystem-for-HIPAA-GDPR-Correction-Requests.png\">Proposed-CodeSystem-for-HIPAA-GDPR-Correction-Requests.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/mzdFDVBSS7RjWhWNZEuvRnnn/Proposed-CodeSystem-for-HIPAA-GDPR-Correction-Requests.png\" title=\"Proposed-CodeSystem-for-HIPAA-GDPR-Correction-Requests.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/mzdFDVBSS7RjWhWNZEuvRnnn/Proposed-CodeSystem-for-HIPAA-GDPR-Correction-Requests.png\"></a></div>",
