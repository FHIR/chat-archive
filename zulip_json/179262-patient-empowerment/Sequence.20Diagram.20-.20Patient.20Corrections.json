(Even if the data happens to be accessible via an API, it's not a given that the patient will have encountered that way - or will want to navigate through their app to try to figure out where it is.

Yes, it's a resource used for a whole lot of purposes.  So is Observation.  It's a generic structure used for asking for something to be done.  EHRs wouldn't be implementing Task <em>just</em> for patient corrections.  They'd be implementing it because they have a need to support external requests for a human to do something.

I don't think I or Drew or others have ever claimed that the current PUT workflows currently available entirely covers 100% of the HIPAA corrections workflow.  Which is why, I think, everybody was willing to hear out the Task based approach - it makes for an excellent yardstick for the PUT workflows to match or exceed.   And part of the interest in testing these APIs during the connectathon is to determine a gap analysis of how much we get versus what else needs to be implemented.</p>\n<p>Second, we're not necessarily saying that ALL updates are going to be possible through PUT workflows.  Updating diagnostic imaging files or genomic files were never going to be in scope to begin with.  So it was never proposed as a universal approach for all resources, and we recognize the that Task might be the only option for a lot of data types.  </p>\n<p>But implementors want to be using these published APIs if they're available.  Today.  Not next year.  And those of us advocating for PUT workflows were always willing to accept an additional PUT Composition or PUT Bundle or PUT DocumentReference operation in addition to the PUT Condition.  We're not objecting to a narrative text and nicely phrased request being recorded along with the update; we'd just post it to DocumentReference and blob it into document storage.</p>",

I can't just route to different data stores on a read by id call without having to understand what that thing was. So on a simple read, I now have to make at least 2 API calls to make that work. That assumes that the workflow exists in our system. In this case, I would be making a completely new workflow that is disruptive to the existing clinical workflow. If you said route the task to the communication system... Well That system doesn't support any of the status you are talking about. Task is significantly more complex here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think having a way for a patient to send a Communciation resource would be nice for lots of reasons (not meaning to segway).

        "content": "<p>One other consideration about using PUT/POST, is that some patient corrections require moving the content from the patient that reported the issue to another patient that may be missing the data.  The patient submitting the correction request may not see the full picture (and shouldn't, for privacy reasons).  If we use PUT/PATCH/POST to remove incorrect data like a positive HIV test, then EHRs would still need some mechanism to track adding that data to the correct patient, reviewing notes that may have pulled in that data, looking at any transitions of care documents that may have sent that data to other organizations, etc.  We <em>could</em> trigger all that (and more, see below) based on an extension or something on a PUT/POST in the REST API, but that's a lot of business logic to execute that would be unrelated to the content of the provide FHIR resource.</p>\n<p>Here is a short list of the tasks that we might perform when we get a Chart Correction Case:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add advisories to all impacted patient charts so that providers reviewing the chart(s) know there are outstanding issues.</li>\n<li>For some issues, patient portal access, transition of care document exchange, and API access MAY be disabled for the impacted patient(s).  This is done if there is a lot of data on the wrong patient and a chart correction specialist determines that temporarily disabling access will limit privacy breaches.  This is human decision based on the specific circumstances, not a system action.</li>\n<li>Flag the incorrect data on the wrong patient as erroneous.  We do keep the data on the chart in case there are legal challenges and a provider needs to demonstrate that the data was on the chart if they made a clinical decision based on that information.</li>\n<li>Add the correct data to the correct patient's chart.</li>\n<li>For some data, we may do a true \"move\" of the data (e.g. for an entire encounter), as we have an audit of the move that we can use for legal reference.</li>\n<li>Review any notes or other areas in the system that may have pulled in the wrong information.  Notes may be corrected, or moved to the other patient's chart as appropriate.  </li>\n<li>Review any communications sent to any affected patients, including letters, portal messages, phone calls, etc.</li>\n<li>For patient identification issues, we may need to re-print wristbands, labels, forms, etc.</li>\n<li>If the data issue means a patient needs to have their care plan updated, new appointments may need to be scheduled.  E.g. if a positive HIV test result was filed to the wrong patient, you need to follow up with the patient that was <em>actually</em> HIV positive.</li>\n<li>Review the overall chart correction case to determine which parties may need to be notified of a data breach.</li>\n<li>Once the data is cleaned up, if any API/portal access or other data exchanges were disabled, they are re-enabled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One thing I think it might be useful for the group to consider is the portal account de-activation task.  That would (for us) mean you'd (temporarily) be unable to access any of the FHIR APIs (including read APIs) until the chart correction case was completed.  I do want to emphasize that portal/API account deactivation is 1) intended to prevent further privacy breaches, 2) is a decision made by a human analyst 3) is done on a case-by-case basis and 4) is temporary.  The implication here is that submitting a chart correction request may trigger the temporary revocation of API access.  Because the reason is privacy related, in many cases this would likely be allowed under the Cures rules as part of the Privacy Exception (since a human analyst was making the determination on case-by-case basis).  However it will have implications on the \"notification of complete\" process.</p>",

Part of the purpose of the document is to underscore that a simple PUT is not the answer. There are so many other pieces to this. We are going to test the Task resource to see if it can be used to communicate all the  required information in that document, including the denial, the disagreement, and rebuttal. We think it can.  </p>\n<p>Here is a picture of a possible use case: <br>\n1) A patient uses their consumer app to pull records into their PHR. They see an error and want the clinic to fix it. They can use that same FHIR app to pull up a UI that allows them to enter information concerning what the error is, what they want done, why they are requesting the change, and perhaps who they want to be notified. [The app can direct them on those pieces of information.]</p>\n<p>2) The app then sends the Task to the entity to let them know there is something the patient wants to be done (a task).  All the pieces of information needed are placed in the Task resource, with Task.description being the place to hold the information from the patient (other areas like Task.input can contain things also, but will not be required). </p>\n<p>3) When the entity gets that task, they will need to do some things internally. When they understand what the org wants to do, they will update the Task to let the patient know if their request was accepted, denied, or requires more time. There are other bits of important information that will be placed in the task resource (by the entity) to give the patient more information. [See the image below which lists the required information for each status]. </p>\n<p>4) The patient can now log back into their consumer app and check the status of the task and the comments associated with that status. </p>\n<p>5) If the request was denied, the patient can use their app to voice their disagreement. The app builds another Task (referencing the previous change request that was denied) and the entity gets another task. </p>\n<p>6) The entity reviews the information, talks to their internal team about next steps, and responds to the patient. </p>\n<p>There may be other conversations going back and forth if the entity needs more information, etc. But, we think this can be done all the way through the denial and rebuttal.</p>",

Our goal for phase 1 of this spec was to ensure we could support the actual request for correction as a narrative but get  that request for correction into EHR medical records workflow and then provide the ability for the patient app to poll to determine the state of the correction request all the way through completion or rejection.  There is another workflow during an encounter where a patient is asked about their meds, allergies, problems, etc and then the clinician compares what they have provided to what they have on their system and reconciles the data. <br>\n Since the patient has the clinician's attention this is an easier one to resolve than the after/between encounters errors on charts that are dormant/closed - that is what the purpose of the patient corrections IG is focusing on.  It is a major complaint of patients - they get home, they get their data, its wrong - what do they do?  They are not with the doctor or nurse any more.  All they can do is call, email, mail, or message from a portal and no way to track the request and make sure it actually gets corrected or not.
