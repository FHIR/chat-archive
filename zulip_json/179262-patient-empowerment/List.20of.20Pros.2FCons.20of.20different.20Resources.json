We are trying to facilitate consensus concerning the resource we should use to enable the bi-directional conversation between a patient and a covered entity when the patient has a request for a correction to their records. </p>\n<p>In an effort to get more feedback, we are going to post specific questions on Zulip first and then find times to get together on calls to discuss the various answers.</p>\n<p>There are several strong opinions about the resource(s) we should use, and we need to understand the strengths/weaknesses of each option. For now, we would like to document the pros and cons of each resource recommendation. This \"first go-round\" is not meant to be a debate about the thoughts listed by others. We simply want you to list what you think are the pros and cons of the choices. We will then present the full list in a meeting so there will be an opportunity for all to discuss the strengths/weaknesses of the different options.</p>\n<p>I realize this may be a different way of researching the choices, but let’s give this a shot. Please don’t focus on what others are saying (and refrain from commenting on their choice). We will have a separate meeting to discuss the pros/cons. Just pretend you are listing the pros/cons of sports figures/desserts/animals…whatever. Be as objective as you can. The options are:<br>\n1)  Use the Task resource only<br>\n2)  Use the Task and Communication resources together<br>\n3)  Use the Task resource with a custom operation for adding the bi-directional conversation to Task.notes <br>\n4)  Use Communication only<br>\n5)  Use PUT/POST/PATCH only<br>\nNOTE: items 1-4 include the ability to add PUT/POST/PATCH within the resource.<br>\nIf you don’t want to answer globally, you can PM me or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191531\">@Virginia Lorenzi</span> .

Second is to use Communication to initiate the request and share back the Task that was created in response, but then to monitor the Task and share information via the Task.  (I suppose there's a third possibility to use Communication for both initiation and discussion, but still have the Task for tracking status, but I think we can just look at the pros and cons from the first two options to evaluate the possibility of combining them.)</p>",

Primarily because medical record amendment requests, when they are currently digitized, are likely happening via CDA  or PDF documents, and being stored in a document server.  And that whole infrastructure is accessed by DocumentReference.   Bundle/Composition because Composition has a JSON/XML equivalent of a PDF document.  </p>\n<p>When I think of the different options, I think of it more in terms of the following:</p>\n<p>1)  Task only<br>\n2)  Communication only<br>\n3)  DocumentReference only<br>\n4)    Bundle(Composition + Other) only<br>\n5)  ServiceRequest only<br>\n6)  Task + Communication<br>\n7)  Task + DocumentReference<br>\n8)  Task + Bundle(Composition + Other)<br>\n9)  Task + Task.notes(Communication)<br>\n10) Task + Task.notes(DocumentReference)<br>\n11) Task + Task.notes(Bundle(Composition + Other))<br>\n12) Communication + DocumentReference<br>\n13) Communication + Bundle(Composition + Other)<br>\n14) ServiceRequest + DocumentReference<br>\n15) ServiceRequest + Bundle(Composition + Other)</p>\n<p>This isn't to suggest any one specific approach from the above, but to suggest that the problem domain tends towards these particular combinations.  </p>\n<p>In particular, Communication is reflective of the presence of a phone bank or switchboard and the telecommunication department's role in routing requests, DocumentReference is reflective of PDF document servers and the medical record departments workflows going all the way back to microfiche machines.  </p>\n<p>Also, some systems have a Bundle service, which to implement requires a Bundle parser.  And since the Bundle requires a Composition or cover letter, as it were,  any system that has a Bundle service will naturally also have a minimal way to parse a Morgan Gleeson letter, as long as it's in Composition format.</p>",
