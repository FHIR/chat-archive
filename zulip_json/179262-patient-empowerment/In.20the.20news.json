This is going to be a big issue in the US at least. </p>\n<p>The point of the article is that although the HIPAA law provides some privacy protection for personal health data held by \"covered entities\" (doctors, insurers, etc), NO SUCH PROTECTION exists for health data once it's outside those walls: if I download it to anywhere, all HIPAA protection ends. </p>\n<p>So, the article points out, patients will be vulnerable to misuse of that data, e.g. by insurance companies or employers.</p>\n<p><strong>GDPR question:</strong> My uneducated impression is that GDPR forbids downstream use of such data.  Is that correct?</p>",

This is not something said explicitly in USA, but is an expectation of all Privacy Principles... that is, when data are gathered it is gathered with a defined and approved purpose, AND that is the only thing that can be done with the data. Expanding the purpose must be done explicitly by going back to the individual to get authorization to do the new purpose.  Exceptions do exist, for example if the data are de-identified. In the USA it is rather common for data to be used for other purposes through simply changing the privacy policy silently. This reuse is often what people find objectionable and creepy.</p>",

An important reality in the US at least is that there are data brokers with no ethics at all who grab data from anywhere they can, aggregate it into blobs of undefined quality, and sell it to buyers with unknown intent. And, as my friend Andrea quoted in that article says, once it's escaped from the fence, there's no way to know what else gets done to it. </p>\n<p>I know I'm mixing up different uses and data types here. My point is that it's messy in every sense.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the more important question in the long run will be whether in reality most people care! I've been astounded at the shrugs I've seen from people of a newer generation than me.  </p>\n<p>In any case it's something to be aware of.</p>",
