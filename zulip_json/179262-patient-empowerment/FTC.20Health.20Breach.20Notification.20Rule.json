I thought there would be a large number of submissions especially given the new rules but was surprised to find there were only 15 comments submitted so far. I would strongly encourage this group to submit your comments and make your voice heard. Unfortunately, the due date is tomorrow, 8/20 by midnight ET. <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/zW1sMXSyzdDGdxOW2Z6trthA/CARIN_FTC-Breach-Notification-Rule_08.19.2020_FINAL.pdf\">CARIN_FTC-Breach-Notification-Rule_08.19.2020_FINAL.pdf</a></p>",
