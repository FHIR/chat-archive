I talked him into signing up here on <a href=\"http://chat.fhir.org\">chat.fhir.org</a> so I could connect him with this work group.  I suspect most of this group would find it interesting if we can get him to present for 15 or 20 minutes on one of our upcoming conference calls.</p>\n<p>Everyone, meet Alam.  Alam, meet the Patient Empowerment work group <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
