Could a PHR audit trail help?  </li>\n<li>How do we prove 'health use' of patient generated data?  Could careplan tracking qualify?  How about receipts for over-the-counter meds?</li>\n<li>Does patient-to-PHR provider qualify as 'exchange' of data?  Could it?  </li>\n<li>Can patient-to-patient sharing of data qualify as 'exchange' of health data?</li>\n<li>Where do Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) fall into this?</li>\n<li>Can a PHR provider also be an ACO?  What are the steps to doing so?  What obligations are assumed?</li>\n<li>Can a patient advocacy group establish 'health use'?  </li>\n<li>Can an argument be made around 'access to posting'?  Or 'access to contribute'?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Steve was kind enough to point us in the general direction of the administrative considerations.  We now need to unpack these clues and figure out how they relate to PRO, PGD, PCD, PHR-S and other implementation guides.</p>",
