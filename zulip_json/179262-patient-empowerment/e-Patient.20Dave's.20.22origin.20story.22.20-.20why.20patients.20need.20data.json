I hope to post another each day, leading up to Seattle, where I'll be blogging daily (my version of singing for my supper).</p>\n<p>This is, for me, an important stake in the ground, which I hope will be of use to interested parties here, and will make a credible case for why a patient would want to get their hands on data to either (a) create their own tools, and/or (b) aggregate their data into a more comprehensive dashboard, or (c) maybe just FACT CHECK what's in the providers' systems.  It's called being an ENGAGED patient, vs being passive lump, a \"car in a carwash\" sort of patient.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> please take note, and please rope in anyone else who ought to be familiar with the genesis of this stuff.</p>",
