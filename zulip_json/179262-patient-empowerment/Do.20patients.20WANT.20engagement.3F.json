(In my 2013 book  <em>Let Patients Help</em> I said \"It's perverse to keep someone in the dark and then call them ignorant.\")</p>\n<p>This same thinking affects many clinicians whose lives are oriented around \"I'm doing this to you - don't interfere\" workflows. When pushed on the question, they commonly say \"Patients wouldn't understand anyway.\"  Sometimes this is said by truly arrogant people, sometimes by people who don't know HOW to explain, but sometimes by people who honestly don't get it.</p>\n<p>Yale cardiologist &amp; journal editor Harlan Krumholz @HMKYale, rabidly pro-patient-access, tweeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hmkyale/status/1141135165844070401\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://twitter.com/hmkyale/status/1141135165844070401\">a short thread with many replies</a>: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Real story.

The 'reference ranges' are an indication of what is normal for 95% of the healthy population - a basis of comparison to understand how measurement issues play.  So 5% of all healthy patients will get results outside that range. (except for a few analytes where the reference range is done differently).</p>\n<p>So what matters is the overall pattern, as compared to the patient's clinical status. I've seen 'normal' results that were urgent indications of impending disaster for a patient. What needs to be drawn attention to is unexpected results for the particular patient. But the lab can't know what they are. </p>\n<p>So flagging abnormal results and focusing on that increases the likelihood of bad outcomes for the patient</p>",

I heard that in jet fighters they'll use a recording of the voice of the mother of the pilot as a last resort - just before they zone out, in case of emergency - use that voice, for that's the only thing that'll still be processed by the most primitive parts of our brain. </p>\n<p>AI is the name of the game, not just to condense the multitudes of data (growing exponentially, and increasingly available at our fingertips) into a summary for a clinician, but also for other audiences (e.g. patients).
