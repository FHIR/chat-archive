If a patient happens to have a chronic condition, then they could easily have 100s of Encounters in their clinical history.  Currently, most EHRs require anywhere from 3-6 keystrokes at a minimum for the doctor to review the data from each patient Encounter Record.  If you multiply the number of keystrokes it takes the doctor to view a single Encounter for a patient times the number of Encounters describing a patient's clinical history, then it can easily take doctors hundreds to thousands of keystrokes just to review the patient's clinical history.  And, because of this most doctors don't have the time to do so.</p>\n<p>When we extract the patients data into a Patient App and/or Patient System, then unless we do something to solve the problem, it will also burden patients with this same repetitive keystrokes pattern to review their own clinical records.</p>\n<p>I personally would like to see us define an HL7 standard that enables Patients, Providers and Payers to  automatically \"merge\" all of the Patient's Encounters into a Master Patient Encounter with provenance for each data element.  Many people believe this alone would help reduce the current Provider error rates for both diagnosis and treatment decisions resulting in a reduction in unnecessary appointments, in the number of deaths due to errors and in medical expenses.</p>",

Finally it has Composition which allows organizing collections of resources into a 'table of contents' where each section has narrative supporting the telling of a 'story'.  Those three resources provide a variety of ways of organizing and providing views into the record that are more efficient/useful than navigating encounters.  However, they can operate in parallel to encounters - because encounters too are useful organizers.  It's just important that they not be the only ones.  One of the challenges for systems now is to support better organization of data <em>across</em> systems, and that requires cultural change in addition to technical change.</p>",

Because of the security features of iOS, apps generally can't access the data within the \"sandbox\" of another app. System frameworks are designed to allow apps to interact in secure ways, and HealthKit is one example of this - apps can read/write to the HealthKit database with user consent. The Health app can be thought of as a 1st-party way to view/edit the data in the HealthKit database.</p>",

The majority of my devices were implanted at an AMC using Epic. I have yet to have a medical encounter where the device information has been readily available. Last month I had to put yet another cut and paste package together of my device info and tesla ratings for an imaging center so I could get an MRI.  I've had to do this at least 5 times over the years. If the info is somewhere in the record it is not bubbling to the surface.  The fastest way to get it is on cath lab reports, but those records just say what was implanted and doesn't have the associated product information  necessary for imaging.</p>",
