I haven't been beating the bushes looking for members because higher levels within HL7 are currently debating whether this new group should be a 'standard' work group or should be something 'special'.  There's strong agreement that a group needs to exist and should be in place by the September WGM.  The question is just what form it should take.  The topic is expected to be discussed as part of the HL7 Board retreat this week.  So I hope to have more insight by the end of next week.  Once the direction is confirmed, we'll accelerate work on recruiting names - if that's what we need to do.</p>\n<p>(For the record, I'm arguing that the Patient WG should be the same as any other and should <em>not</em> be a special entity.)</p>",

If you can get it on the agenda, that would be good.  I doubt we'll have our ducks in a row to have the proposal ready to approve by then - and I expect the SD would want time to review it before approving anyhow.  However, if you can get them to have a sense of comfort with it and identify any concerns we might need to address, that would help when the time comes to get the actual document through on a call.</p>",
