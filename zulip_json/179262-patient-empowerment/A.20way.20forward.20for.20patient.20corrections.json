(however, as much as possible inputs and outputs are optional and information could be communicated by another means)  </li>\n<li>use notes on fulfiller side only to communicate information about the work done on the task which could include notation about patient correspondence.</li>\n<li>carefully design ability to update a request (Vassil and Lloyd have provided advice on this).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a separate but related function or project, create a second capability to support a FHIR equivalent of secure messaging between patient portal and provide message boxes.  This could be used for any number of purposes.  One purpose could be to correspond with patient about clarifications on correction request.  Provide capability in the Communication and/or CommunicationRequest resource to point to the RequestforCorrection Task.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on this, I think there is another problem that could use the same paradigm: a patient's Request for Release of Information.   Especially when data is not available to the portal or API, this is very much a manual process.  And if data could come to the API, even as a PDF that would be valuable.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"225094\">@Debi Willis</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197491\">@Dave deBronkart</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192685\">@Vassil Peytchev</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192825\">@Jeffrey Danford</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192205\">@Lisa Nelson</span></p>",

It's not grandiose but it will be more attractive to implementers because of ease of use (realistic first step).
