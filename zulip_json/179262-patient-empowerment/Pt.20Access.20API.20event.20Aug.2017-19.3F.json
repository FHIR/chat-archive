They invited Argonaut and CARIN to participate since we are each working on different aspects of the rule (US Core/USCDI and CARIN IG for Blue Button). Everyone is invited to attend although the primary audience is the development teams (payers, apps, enablers) who are working to implement the CMS interoperability rule. . . and of course the technically-oriented patient advocates on this thread. The first two days are educational for the technical community and the third day will focus on testing. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192054\">@Viet Nguyen</span> is working with HL7 to organize.</p>",
