If that is the extent of info blocking, I'd say the industry overall is doing fricking amazing at info sharing.  But I suspect the picture isn't so rosy.  Either 1) patients aren't reporting much to OCR or 2) there are a bunch of other actions that aren't covered in that article.  Or both.  Probably both?</p>",

I have good access, I have corrected my data, I have had control over access (not good control, but some). All the broad handwaving was important, but too easy for the really bad actors to stay hidden. So I am glad to see some bad actors called to account.</p>",
