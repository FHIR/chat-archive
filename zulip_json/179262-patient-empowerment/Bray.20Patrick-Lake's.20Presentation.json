MedicAlert has some limited value.  I think we should be working with device manufacturers to create a digital library of their patient product cards but then somehow I need a pipe to the actual images of the devices in my body so emergency physicians can have rapid comparisons to look for damage and misplacement. I've also been denied MRIs until I could produce the necessary documentation about tesla ratings, which is kind of ridiculous to think that we put that burden on the patient.  It should be immediately obvious when a patient has an implanted device. The primary way of finding that info now is reading old cath lab reports but that in no way links to the actual product information.</p>",

So being asked a would you rather question – I can see why you would pick app.  But you yourself said you need a communication tool to help you communicate effectively with your provider.  You could tell them what the app has told you, bring a print out although who prints from apps, or stand close to your provider and show them this data on your phone.  Don’t forget your phone!  Make sure its powered!  Don’t be unconscious!<br>\nThis question reminds me on how computer applications in healthcare always start.  We wanted a system to manage the lab.  It turns out the lab system has information that is very useful for folks outside the lab – RESULTS.  Getting the data out of the lab system becomes very important.  First its lab techs reading the system and telling people results on calls, then its paper reports walked or mailed, perhaps a portal into the lab system.  And then someone builds that electronic interface.  Labs flow right into the medical record.  And even into other systems.  This enables better teamwork, and smarter and safer care.  This is exactly why I am an interoperability freak.<br>\nSo dream with me now…<br>\nWouldn’t it be cool if you could create your own summary with graphics and pictures press send and your doctor gets it? She could review it in advance of the visit.   She can bring it up on her big screen to discuss with you.  She can have it as part of the record (albeit perhaps its patient correspondence to start).  And it can live in the record so that next time they still have it (you could update), when you call on the phone they have it, and other clinicians on the care team have it (great example is in a hospital admission)?<br>\nNote that the Patient Empowerment Workgroup is especially interested in moving the needle on patient contributed data and we would love your help.</p>",

Manufacturers make them and submit them to FDA, but when I asked where mine were during post-op visits I found they had been thrown away with the product packaging and was further told by my specialists' NPs that there was no reason for patients to need those.

As you mention it is an uphill battle to get device resource data even at a most basic level of patient access.  Fortunately, UDI and data in AccessGUDID (including MRI safety associated with UDI-Device identifier of model/version of device) are still called out in ONC interoperability rule and hospitals and vendors are beginning to focus on UDI capture and patient access to that data.  Another area that would close the loop here is to have better, more structured data associated with a device recalls.   Ideal is for patient not only to have access to the standards UDI data for their implant but also be notified when that device is recalled.  The recall data submitted to FDA and available to health systems and patients needs to be tied to UDI and its not consistently being done.  This is frankly our next big hurdle.</p>",

The majority of my devices were implanted at an AMC using Epic. I have yet to have a medical encounter where the device information has been readily available. Last month I had to put yet another cut and paste package together of my device info and tesla ratings for an imaging center so I could get an MRI.  I've had to do this at least 5 times over the years. If the info is somewhere in the record it is not bubbling to the surface.  The fastest way to get it is on cath lab reports, but those records just say what was implanted and doesn't have the associated product information  necessary for imaging.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This makes me think that as we start to \"ford the river\" of actually doing interop, there may be a use for some sort of middleware that helps people like Bray declare specifically what stuff they want to extract from each source system, so they can then aggregate it using other apps. </p>\n<p>I think 1upHealth does this for BlueButton data.

The issue is that systems don't necessarily support the standards yet - and even where they do, culture/processes don't necessarily support the capture.  The former is driven by both provider demand  (questionable as there isn't necessarily a direct business benefit and it's not a key marketing differentiator) and regulation (is there any?).  The latter is driven by customer demand, regulation and professional practice expectations.  HL7 doesn't typically have a ton of influence over any of these things.  However, we can create greater awareness of the standards and educate implementers about the value to patients of conforming to them.</p>",

There is definitely continued interest in recording UDI not only for clinical but business reasons.  My frustration is that capturing the UDI is so incredibly easy from a technical perspective.  It's a bar code that can be scanned and parsed into any system with the capability to receive it- just like the items we scan in retail stores.   The UDI-DI (device identifier part of UDI) is linked to a publicly accessible database with master authoritative device about all regulated implants made in US and once, scanned, the UDI could be used to auto-populate a patient's record with that information.  Once scanned and linked, the implant cards Bray describes can be downloaded to phone apps or printed.   In addition, other patient care benefits can be derived - e.g.  identifying whether a device  is MRI safe, made of latex etc.  I agree that it will take a combination of policy, business drivers and PATIENT VOICE to make capture of UDI more routine.  I applaud <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"311598\">@Bray Patrick-Lake</span>  and other patients with implants that speak out about this.  Any ideas on how to amplify this message are welcome as part of HL7 activities or with other groups.  I personally think it might taken a coalition that involves all stakeholders - it's a big boulder to push up the hill even thought it seems so needed for patient safety</p>",

Have there been any spot checks to see who's actually implementing it?  I don't see how device info for people like me who've had things implanted in the past is going to get into the record though.  I think that would require NLP or hand entry.   Any ideas for patients with older implants?</p>",
