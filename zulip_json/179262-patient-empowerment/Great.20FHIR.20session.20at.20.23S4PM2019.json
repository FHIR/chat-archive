        "content": "<p>Yesterday at the Society for Participatory Medicine's third annual conference, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191782\">@Brian Kaney</span> gave a great short talk (~15 minutes), giving them a brief introduction to the existence of FHIR.  The great majority of them are interested in data access, but are not at ALL technical; but also in the audience were SPM members <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191387\">@Keith Boone</span>  and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194782\">@Nancy Lush</span> . </p>\n<p>Both Brian and his \"sponsor\" in SPM (me) were challenged to figure out how to alert people to FHIR's emergence-in-process.  The non-technical people's eyes often looked puzzled but curious; the truth came out during 10 minutes of Q&amp;A, which started slow but quickly picked up, to the point where we had to cut it short when time ran out.  And as the others will attest, it got feverish in a good way - as I ended discussion I said \"Heated confusion - this is great!\" and everyone laughed. </p>\n<p>The whole last session is in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/participatorymedicine/videos/539567450143262/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/participatorymedicine/videos/539567450143262/\">this Facebook Live video</a>.  I gave 5 minutes of background, then around the right-side minute marker 1:02:00 Brian starts.</p>\n<p>Around 24:30 left, Keith touts the Patient Engagement Workgroup. :-)</p>",
