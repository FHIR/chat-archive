For other EHRs, once your application is tested with the EHR vendor and you have your application client ID and secret from the vendor, the applications don't need to be authorized (as in white listing) by each provider site. We do need the clinic's FHIR endpoint and other pieces of information to list them in our consumer app. Epic lists all the information needed for their sites who already have their API implemented (<a href=\"https://open.epic.com/MyApps/Endpoints\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://open.epic.com/MyApps/Endpoints\">https://open.epic.com/MyApps/Endpoints</a>). Other EHRs tell their clinics to reach out to us to give us their FHIR endpoint and other required information. Some clinics are confused about that because they think that once they have the API, any FHIR apps can be used. As far as AthenaHealth goes, my understanding is they are not ready for FHIR apps because they don't have a way for patients to authenticate yet. We have reached out many times and when they do respond, that is the feedback we are getting.</p>",

This is really important for patients to retrieve their data from all their providers \"without special effort\". I am hoping this becomes a reality.  (Epic is already doing this.) Here is the text:<br>\nii. Publication of FHIR Endpoints <br>\nIn order to interact with a FHIR RESTful API, an app needs to know the “FHIR Service Base URL,” which is often referred to colloquially as a “FHIR server’s endpoint.”93 The public availability and easy accessibility of this information is a central necessity to assuring the use of FHIR-based APIs without special effort, especially for patient access apps. Accordingly, we propose to adopt in § 170.404(b)(2) a specific requirement that an API Technology Supplier must support the publication of Service Base URLs for all of its customers, regardless of those that are centrally managed by the API Technology Supplier or locally deployed, and make such information publicly available (in a computable format) at no charge. In instances where an API Technology Supplier is contracted by an API Data Provider to manage its FHIR server, we expect that this administrative duty will be relatively easy to manage. In instances where an API Data Provider assumes full responsibility to “locally manage” its FHIR server, the API Technology Supplier would be required, pursuant to this proposed maintenance requirement, to obtain this information from its customers. We strongly encourage API Technology Suppliers, health care providers, HINs and patient advocacy organizations to coalesce around the development of a public resource or service from which all stakeholders could benefit. We believe this would help scale and enhance the ease with which Service Base URLs could be obtained and used.</p>",
