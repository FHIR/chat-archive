Each of these arguments induces in me a migraine-like cascade of painful shocks.  </p>\n<p>The good news is that not ALL HCPs feel this way for benighted reasons. Many, though, are benighted; I have an ongoing disagreement with the CIO of my hospital, Dr. John Halamka, which is summarised in my exchange of blog posts with him a couple of years ago.  He had blogged, in flagrant ignorance (ironic for his expert reputation), that not one patient of our system's 2 million had ever requested a download of their full record.  Turns out that one factor might be that they don't HAVE a way to request it, which I uncovered in my series of posts responding to him. <a href=\"https://www.epatientdave.com/2016/11/07/dear-john-i-want-to-download-my-records/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.epatientdave.com/2016/11/07/dear-john-i-want-to-download-my-records/\">https://www.epatientdave.com/2016/11/07/dear-john-i-want-to-download-my-records/</a></p>\n<p>Continued...</p>",

And then, wonderfully, at the October app roundtable, Michael Morris demonstrated EXACTLY the sort of hack I'd been arguing would be possible once we HAVE said spigots. </p>\n<p>Serendipitously, Morris's n-of-1 dashboard is a close parallel to what MITRE Corp's Kristina Sheridan PhD had done years earlier for her daughter Kate, who had been utterly incapacitated by Lyme disease - from football and academic star to disabled on the couch. She and Kate spoke at HIMSS 2018, relating how Kristina had (after 30 doctors and 15 diagnoses) taken matters into her own hands, manually pounding a 50cm pile of printouts into Excel, developing a dashboard of their own, creating a view of this difficult case that no doctor had, including a completely new summary of Kate's 26 symptoms. (My post about them at SPM's conference last month <a href=\"https://participatorymedicine.org/epatients/2018/09/spm2018-speaker-preview-kristina-sheridan-leveraging-the-data-of-patients-stories.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://participatorymedicine.org/epatients/2018/09/spm2018-speaker-preview-kristina-sheridan-leveraging-the-data-of-patients-stories.html\">https://participatorymedicine.org/epatients/2018/09/spm2018-speaker-preview-kristina-sheridan-leveraging-the-data-of-patients-stories.html</a> links to the video of their full hour-long HIMSS speech.)</p>\n<p>What Kristina did manually, with extreme labor by a PhD researcher mom, Morris did a million times faster (I imagine) with his programming skills.</p>\n<p>Each flies in the face of the esteemed Halamka's beliefs that patients would have no use for the data.</p>\n<p>Continued.</p>",

If the 2018 version of Kristina Sheridan showed up, with an URGENT need and desire to find out 'Is this for me???? Can this help me save my kid??',\" could there be a more consumer-centered introduction??</p>\n<p>So, what SHOULD such an introduction include?  Honestly I don't know enough to outline it with confidence, but some thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A brief hello / welcome, recognising the visitor may be a Morris-level coder or completely tech-naive, explaining what FHIR is.<ul>\n<li>Note: with luck, word of FHIR will spread far and wide, so we must assume unknown knowledge levels.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A brief passage - sort of a disambiguation page - (pardon my imprecise wording)</li>\n<li>if you have no idea what this is about, and want to learn more, _start here_</li>\n<li>If you know what FHIR is about but are not technical, _start here_</li>\n<li>If you know how write software and want to get started, _start here_</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, those are naive examples.  My intent is that we want to be welcoming for the whole spectrum of people - consumers who have a need they want to voice, as well as the Kristina Sheridan level, as well as the Michael Morris level, and probably eleventeen sub-species that we'll discover once we get some traffic going. </p>\n<p>Some topics to include:  (All at a <em>very</em> simple level, at first; anyone interested in more can learn it, but we don't want to scare away people who might have a valid use case.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is FHIR? (Consumer level)</li>\n<li>Why would anyone want to use it?</li>\n<li>How would I get started learning more?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An important use case, btw, is the example from my Amsterdam talk that ultimately broke through the limits of traditional typesetting: the consumer's \"nephew\" who says \"Hey, I could code that FOR you.\"  IOW, don't be limited to thinking about the probable skill set of the sick person him/herself.</p>\n<p>Grahame, is this a sufficient starting answer (including explanation) to your question?  Is my context and intent clear?</p>",

I want to suggest, though, that not all use cases require that patients understand the spec. </p>\n<p>I very much anticipate cases where someone says \"My dad has Parkinsons AND is allergic to XYZ\" (or any other combination), or even \"My dad has Parkinsons that is not responding to anything,\" leading to (for instance) a care proxy person who has the same desires Kristina and Morris had, but without the skills those two have.

For that audience, I don't think much other needs to be done than what is already there. The spec itself is the key. In addition to the spec itself, the first things I'd look for are \"Who's using it?\" and \"For what?\". I think most of that info is already available, but it would perhaps be nice to have a listing of existing \"hacks\" once we have a collection of those. That would also cater for the \"app user\" audience. And if some of the implementations support the \"data courier\" use case, let's of course list those too.</p>\n<p>I do see the chicken-and-egg problem here... I'd personally find it more logical to list implementations once they emerge. I don't know what would be an effective way of communicating the opportunities the spec offers, without concrete examples.</p>\n<p>The other point I see is what <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> mentioned in Amsterdam. We could have a working group for patient advocates, or have more patient advocates participating in existing working groups, to make sure the spec itself takes into account the concerns of patients.
