I'm thinking about the problem more in terms of a) mapping the FHIR ecosystem and b) understanding what percentage of network coverage that our longitudinal timeline can access.  So I'm inclined to start by loading up all 5000+ hospitals in the US that receive Medicare funds into our database; adding in the publicly curated lists of endpoints, and maybe feeding all that into a spider bot to go out and crawl the metadata routes and capability statements.  Maybe setting a worklist also, and simply assigning someone to work the list and cold call the hospitals.  </p>\n<p>With that kind of approach, a partial network map provides more visibility than no network map.</p>",

We really want your feedback on how we can improve the site!!!  Actually, every application on the site uses FHIR APIs to access health records. It's one of the questions we ask as part of the onboarding process. Other ideas you have for what we should be doing to onboard these apps would also be helpful.</p>",

Our board revisited the idea of affiliations today and we're going to do some additional thinking on the topic before we post that section on the site. Affiliations tried to convey too much (where there were connected, who they were connected to, what best practices they attested to, etc.) It was an 'experiment' on how we begin to build transparency and trust in the ecosystem. Feedback like this is really helpful. Keep it<br>\n coming!</p>",
