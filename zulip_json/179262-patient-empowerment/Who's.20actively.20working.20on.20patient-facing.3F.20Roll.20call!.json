The biggest issue for a patient currently trying to use the apps is that there’s a pretty high probability that the app doesn’t support all, or even one, of the patient’s healthcare providers yet. Most EHR vendors set it up so that the apps need to be authorized by each provider organization individually before they can access the APIs. Because getting that authorization is very time-consuming for app companies, I haven’t seen an app yet that supports more than about 20-30% of provider organizations. A bunch of comments in the information blocking proposed rule called that issue out and proposed solutions though so hopefully it’s addressed quickly.</p>",
