They get their data and actually stay.<br>\n•   We are certainly not perfect, and are always trying to improve access to ACTIONABLE data for patients, with ACTIONABLE tools, not just data dumps.<br>\n•   And the jewel – As part of our participation in the (formerly known as) Meaningful Use program – the largest and oldest MU participant in the program – we will be implementing across our network an API interface for our patients to have access to their data via FHIR-based apps.
