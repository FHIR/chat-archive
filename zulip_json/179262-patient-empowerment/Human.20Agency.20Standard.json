To what degree that patient can have agency is cultural, but I support it where it's possible. But I think that Adrian is taking a very narrow view of the information ownership question, one that ignores lots of case law (so far as I can see)</p>",

There's a half-dozen commonly identified ethical frameworks, including Autonomy/Agency, Social Justice, Non-Maleficence , Doing-Good, Utilitarianism, Deontology, along with a few other esoteric ones.  Human Agency Standard obviously represents Autonomy/Agency ethics, and is an essentially critical worldview.  It's constrained by real heavy hitting alternatives though, such as the Hippocratic Oath itself; any economist or administrator trained in John Stuart Mills and utilitarianism; centralized government authorities and executive orders (deontology), and social justice advocacy. Of the major ethical standards, Autonomy is arguably the most patient-centered.  (Which is why we centered it within our mission statement and business documents.)</p>",

And Apple can act as a middle man as noted on this thread, but its not the only one.  1upHealth can also do that - they probably serve a unified FHIR view to their app developers.</p>",
