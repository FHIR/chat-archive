In the US, there is a proposed regulation referred to as the PFS 2020 proposed reg and comments are being accepted until 9/27/19.  In it is an RFI on PGHD.  Simply search for PGHD in the rule.  I would argue that patient corrections could be considered PGHD.  There is also an RFI about EHR safety.  If anyone wants to read the regulation it can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/14/2019-16041/medicare-program-cy-2020-revisions-to-payment-policies-under-the-physician-fee-schedule-and-other\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/14/2019-16041/medicare-program-cy-2020-revisions-to-payment-policies-under-the-physician-fee-schedule-and-other\">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/14/2019-16041/medicare-program-cy-2020-revisions-to-payment-policies-under-the-physician-fee-schedule-and-other</a><br>\nIf you want to comment on it here is how: n commenting, please refer to file code CMS-1715-P.

So I think your point on EHR Safety will have infinitely more leverage.</p>",
