The remaining 20% could be summarized in the following two challenges (imo):</p>\n<p>1. Coordination of test patients between EHR vendors.  We're finding that each EHR has a different set of test patients (Jason/Jessica Argonaut, Nancy SMART &amp; family, Candace Salinas, etc).  Which is nice, but doesn't help with use cases around patient matching, consolidating patient summary data, and otherwise.  This is ostensibly what the Ring of FHIR project is hoping to address (I think), although the Synthea project is also relevant.  It would be great to get an IG for a longitudinal patient record that encompases all the major EHR vendors.  Register that longitudinal patient in Synthea, have the folks running Ring of FHIR register the patient in each of the participating EHR instances, fetch that patient across the Ring of FHIR, and get that reference in place so these patient centered apps can compare their results with the benchmark.  <br>\n2. Secondly, it's the 'write data' use case.  And specifically...  how to track provenance?  How is quality control performed?  Are standards such as the Integrated Health Model Initiative (IHMI) and other evidence-based-medicine being supported?  What does the workflow for return data look like?  Is it fully automated or is it queued?  And so forth.  We have some ideas about how we want (hope) these processes to look like, but I suspect it's going to be cat-herding of different ideas.  My worry is that the major EHRs are going to try to influence these IGs, and they're going to default to an assumption of keyboards, mice, and laptops because of intrenched investments; and ignore advanced/consumer haptics use cases involving NFC, geolocation, voice, IoT, etc.</p>",

Is there an example of what a patient API would need to do that is not possible with (or not well suited to) a provider API?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think it through in terms of syntax and grammar.  In English, we have nouns, verbs, direct objects, possessives, propositions, etc.  The default FHIR API is pretty much just verbs (get/put/post/delete) acting on nouns (resources).  SMART on FHIR then extends that model by introducing direct-objects via the provider launch context.  No longer am I simply an abstract librarian fetching an abstract medical record; but now I'm a provider fetching the records of a specific somebody else.  ‚Ä®‚Ä®</p>\n<p>The thing is... somewhere along the way, we began to assume that SMART on FHIR provider launch context is the default.  From a business perspective, traditional billable activities for providers (and ROI) is all within the provider launch context.  So implementors simply begin with the provider launch context, because that's where the money is.  Patient launch context is still not implemented on some of the major EHR vendor systems.  </p>\n<p>But back to the syntax and grammar model‚Ä¶ a Patient API would have a few things‚Ä¶  ‚Ä®a SMART on FHIR patient-launch context, at the very least.  That would involve using the launch context to describe a sense of ‚Äòself‚Äô.  Basically a self-referential loopback, similar to 127.0.0.1, but at the application level.  I suspect that will involve putting the patientId in some standardized place along with the OAuth access token, as it seems to differ between EHR implementations right now.  ‚Ä®‚Ä®</p>\n<p>Once we can get that sense of ‚Äòself‚Äô, then the grammar and syntax of the API can have meaningful possessive attributes.  The most interesting of which is probably a <code>$my</code> operator, followed by <code>$near</code>,<code>$recent</code> and other prepositions.  <code>Get my procedures.  Get my medication orders.  Get providers near me.</code> and so forth. </p>\n<p>Compare that in contrast to the provider/EHR model of looking up a patient‚Ä¶  name, age/date of birth, sex/gender?  Why would any patient need or want to look up records in such a format?  How often does that change?  It's entirely premised on a many-to-one usecase, whereas the Patient API usecase is almost entirely one-to-one(self).  Also, what value would a <code>$my</code> operator be to a provider?  The patient doesn‚Äôt care about their doctor‚Äôs medical records.  But as a patient you know what would be useful?  <code>POST $my Medications _history $to Providers $near $me.</code>  I'm using pseudocode to illustrate the point; and how that gets sorted out to REST API I'm not sure.  But suffice it to say that there would be different usage patterns for Patient centric access.  </p>\n<p>tl;dr‚Ä¶  Anyhow... much of what would be needed to satisfy the needs for a Patient API will probably involve SMART on FHIR and query/search parameters.</p>",
