If you're enabling an EMT service to do something similar, needs might be different.  </p>\n<p>From a consumer perspective (not in an emergency), I've always felt that shoppers need to tie in to the Leapfrog Group's Hospital Safety Score.

So if that's easy for you to suck in, it could be useful. </p>\n<p>Someday I want to see that safety score as an optional overlay on real estate shopping sites!
