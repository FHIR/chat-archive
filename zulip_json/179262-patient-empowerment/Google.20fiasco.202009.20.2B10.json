Setting the stage for a data disaster, part 2</a></p>\n<p>April 12: Reprise of the 3500 word blog post that became front page news and landed me in Washington, despite having no clue.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The back story:</p>\n<p>Right now is ten years plus a month since I announced I was going to put my data in Google Health and MS HealthVault, which led to my discovering how incompetent some people in health IT were (are? I don't know) and thrust me into a spotlight not of my own design. </p>\n<p>From an IT perspective, a pervasive theme is the issue of \"fitness for purpose.\" It's the IT professionalism fail that led some to think billing data was a valid proxy for clinical reality. The other was my hospital's absurd decision to declare victory when they had never tested their Google Health interface on real customer data. </p>\n<p>Then people were stunned when a patient with no health IT training (me, a random day-job data jockey) discovered the emperor's new clothes were a fiction.</p>\n<p>If I recall correctly (and contemporaries like <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191387\">@Keith Boone</span> may correct me) a major problem back then was that there WERE no use cases for that interface - just \"Send whatever data you have,\" which my hospital did. And since no acceptance criteria were defined, the resulting load of crap that arrived could not be found wanting - except by common sense. </p>\n<p>More details to come, in this stream as the days go by.</p>",
