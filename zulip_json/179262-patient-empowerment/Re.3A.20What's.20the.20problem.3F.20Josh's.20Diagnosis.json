Even though we try to say in the IG something like \"<em>beyond the API everything's a black box, anything goes, do what works in your product</em>\" ... the assessment above still stands, and the pain points are real.</p>\n<p>The endless debate about \"Is Task the right resource?\" is a distraction.</p>",

A state that also has ADA disability laws mandating that medical corrections be available via TTY devices for deaf people may rightfully say that corrections need to go through a phonebank, and it's the Communication department's responsibility.  Not to mention that Business Associate Agreements muddle things, because a medical record that needs a correction might be in a system covered by the BAA but which isn't actually a Provider organization.  SLA requirements say that the corrections have to be able to be made 24/7 for medical emergencies, so who has the budget that's running the help desk?

And then we get back all the statuses on the order from the filler system - blood needs to be drawn, specimen collected, in lab, prelim results, final results, etc.  They are telling the other systems stuff that impacts the workflow on those systems.  CCDA feeds into clinical reconciliation, required in the US for PI  in 2020.  HL7 defined the CCDA spec.  ONC required that it be used and that patient matching and clin rec be done.  And even the FHIR read only API is impacting providers.  With the FHIR Request for Corrections IG, its just an interface - we are not telling the ehr what it has to do, no more than orders interfaces do.  This is an interface problem.  This is not openehr.  We can define the spec but how it is used is up to the industry or regulators.

They also recommend that notes be kept in the EHR.</p>",

According to your recent email, your intention is to do exactly that. You wrote, \"Argonaut lists create, update, and patch as optional with a MAY requirement, when an IG that truly addresses patient needs regarding correcting medical records has got to treat it as a SHALL.\" You said you tried for 3 years to make this happen and now you want to force the issue by including it in our IG. </p>\n<p>We are trying to accomplish testing Task to see if it meets the goal. You are trying to force EHR vendors to change MAY to SHALL. Those are two very different motives.  </p>\n<p>Test PUT please and let us test Task without ranting at us that we are requiring everyone \"to speak the same language\". This is simply not true (as well as many other statements you have made) and it takes away from collaboration. Having different views is good. Spreading lies is not good.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The law piece is a bit of distraction.  The key consideration is that workflow pretty much everywhere (regardless of law) is that patients can't drive changes to much (if any) of their clinical or administrative record without human review and approval.  That fundamental fact is driven by the fact that patients don't have the training/understanding of the changes they might make and don't understand the ramifications of corrections on other parts of the record (e.g. other patients) they can't see.  It's also driven by the fact that there isn't always trust between the patients and practitioners.  Therefore, whatever solution we define needs to be focused on that human-to-human (i.e. Patient/Caregiver to provider/admin-staff) communication and enable a traceable conversation.  Whether there's any interest from the EHR community in enabling that conversation to occur through the EHR is an open question.  However, a synchronous PUT is not going to allow for human review.  As such, it's not going to meet the use-case.</p>",
