He is a classic specimen of the \"superpatient\" archetype I described in my Amsterdam talk - \"patients who EXTEND SCIENCE when all other options are gone.\"</p>\n<p>As an activist for social change I'm keenly attuned to the current dominant beliefs that hold back change, particularly holding back an expanded role for patients in all aspects of medicine. One of those key beliefs is \"medical science is hard, so what could a patient without that training possibly contribute??\" </p>\n<p>Stories like Doug's are a thunderclap-level answer to that question! And once that's recognised as reality, holding back data becomes indefensible.</p>",
