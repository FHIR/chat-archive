The Privacy Principles are well documented in many standards, and fundamental to GDPR. They however never get full perspective in the USA.

There is way too much patchwork of Privacy Policies. The very fact you need to have different sections speaking to ONC, CMS, HHS, FTC, and all of the states... The Patient, especially their Privacy (Principles) are harmed by this non-coordinated effort. This chaos enables abuse of Patient Privacy Principles in the gaps, and prevents failures from being enforced as the bodies presume the other organization is covering 'that' issue.</p>",
