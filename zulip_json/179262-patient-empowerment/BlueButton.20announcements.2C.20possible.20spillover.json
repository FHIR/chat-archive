Come look.\"</p>\n<p>With luck, this may lead to some new and pretty savvy patient voices joining here.</p>\n<p>More later ... I'm speaking at a Medicare event this morning.</p>",

Asking how useful the EOB/claims data will be is a legitimate question. But I think a better question is whether the benefits of making the data easily available to patients outweighs the risks. Access to this type of data does not preclude access to any other type.</p>\n<p>While the EOB/claims data is generally not as high-fidelity as clinical data that comes directly from health systems, it is typically more comprehensive because it reflects that patientâ€™s engagement with every health organization or pharmacy where their insurance has been used.</p>\n<p>This can be very helpful, for example, to know if a user actually paid for and picked-up their prescription, which is more than we can know today from health system med lists. I believe while the utility of the data may not be as clear today as we would like, making the data available to patients (and, by extension, the apps of their choice), will result in more opportunities for more developers to figure out how make use of it to the benefit of patients (with their consent, of course).</p>",

There have already been cases where a patient was able to see what was being billed to their insurance company and they were able to let the insurance company know they never received the products or services a company was billing the insurance company for. I have multiple instances where my insurance was billed for another patient's service. Seeing that information will help the patient  make sure their records are correct with the insurance company and also help insurance companies find cases of insurance fraud. Transparency is a win-win for everyone.</p>",

I certainly think there's value in getting people interested in even \"orts\" (crumbs) of data.  OTOH, I'm <strong>so freaking tired</strong> of semi-informed media coverage saying \"Oo oo oo you can get 'your health data'!!!\" when they don't have a clue what they're talking about.  I think HL7 in general and FHIR community in specific can be a voice for clarity on this.</p>\n<p>Time after time I hear people saying things that make clear that they don't realize CMS claims data (aka BlueButton) is (a) very limited in scope, and (b) often very poor quality, as in \"false\"! :-) </p>\n<p>This is a valuable discussion - we're opening an entirely new space of public conversations about health data items that until now were an invisible pile of glop, a patchy collection of some valuable items and some mistakes.  Your example of \"I can tell whether they picked up their script\" is a great illustration - a valid though isolated use case, yet far far far from the grand vision some people hear when they see \"get your health data.\" <span aria-label=\"slight smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"slight smile\">:slight_smile:</span></p>",
