As you can imagine, the EHR situation in many part of Africa is very basic. When they are available (not often) access is not possible for patients, and paper is the way things are done for most patients. So we are starting by putting the data from paper directly in  people’s mobile phone by transforming it manually. So, 1) their data can follow them anywhere. 2) and if it is in FHIR and SNOMED CT, then it can be interoperable and we hope can be accessed elsewhere (anywhere in the world?), and more in the future on the ground in Africa too. Medical professionals here in Rwanda and Burudni don’t know anyone doing this kind of things yet. We hope it can give better data and better health</p>\n<p>About Children’s  and adolescents rights<br>\nCould you please ask this to The Sovereignty Network? We are using their platform, and just started. What I know is that they have done patient record permissions before, and they know how to do detailed access. I know there will be ability to transfer to the child the record when they are adult.</p>",

First, we help the person get their source data (usually on paper). Then we manually transcribe the data into medical terminologies like SNOMED and LOINC. Then with patient permission and confidentiality we send the data to Sovereignty and they create a personal account, this account is owned and controlled by the person. They then convert the data we transcribed into the personally owned account in their FHIR Server. So it is the Sovereignty platform where the data is converted in FHIR, under the ownership and control of the individual. They showed us how to do this. It completely changes the game for us in Africa. We can do things that we could not have imagined before. We can do all of this just on our PC and mobile phones.</p>",

We have been collecting patient data on paper and sending it into electronic medical records, research databases, or any other place. We can also send it to multiple places at the same time. We can send it anywhere and in any format. We are collecting many different kinds of data including medical records and SDOH. It is used in schools, homeless shelters, and medical clinics using both paper and electronic formats. The data is then converted, scored when necessary, and sent to wherever it is needed. If you’d like to chat, we can see if we can help you.</p>",

We would very much like to talk with you about that. If your systems are able to upload the data to our platform's FHIR Server to make the manual data processes quicker and more efficient for our \"Data Champions\" like Olivier and his team, that is something greatly sought after. I had a look at your product lineup and got very excited looking at your Wellness Visit Quality Data Capture and Scan Forms as only healthcare data geeks can! :)  I do believe there is lots of scope for your clinic products too moving forward. Business-wise, we have designed the platform for companies like yours that offer needed services to offer them directly to the people that want to use them. Would you like to chat next week with us? Between Rwanda, the US and New Zealand let's see if we can work out a time that doesn't cause too much insomnia for one or more parties!</p>",

My team is back to work with hope and courage to accomplish what we have committed to do with the FHIR community.  As a member of The Sovereignty Network, we have access to their FHIR server and their data converters that can handle a wide range of data types, so we can be Data Champions, but we desperately want to make our data sourcing and our data transcribing process more efficient.<br>\nThe hardest part of our work is to collect papers after a patient clinic visit then clean them, we spend so much time and manual energy here and I'm sure technology can help. For example, OCR and NLP and voice recognition technologies might make the transcribing of sourced paper data quicker.  And if there is something we can check the quality of the transcribed and cleaned data output we do (QA) that would also be good. E.g. Any system or experts who can help check our accuracy of using Shrimp (to find the SNOMED CT “magic number”).<br>\nIf we can get better, we would like to do not just as Data Champions working for Data Owners in Africa, but we would also like to do this as an outsourcing service for Data Owners around the world. We have the motivation, and cost advantage in Africa gives us an advantage we can use to give good value at reasonable price.<br>\nFinally, as Hamish and I always talk about, making people’s mobile phone as the “true source of data” in Africa is possible, because we have such few EHRs to begin with. Maybe this is actually our advantage in Africa to create interoperable health record for everyone on their mobile phone! And this can be good for the value of Data Owner data so they can make income by licensing later on The Sovereignty Network to healthcare companies like pharmaceutical and for R&amp;D.</p>",
