Also, considering how much interest the patient track got from developers in Amsterdam, it might interest some in Cleveland.  So my instincts are telling me we should draft something. </p>\n<p>Of course perhaps the scope of \"we\" might be \"n=1,\" i.e. me.  But having lived my whole life as a soloist, I'm trying hard to grow a skill set with ensembles.  </p>\n<p>Some might say \"Why wait for Cleveland? Why not just publish something now?\"  My instincts respond that it's both outbound and inbound: (a) to grow public awareness of DevDays as \"a thing\" in the world, and (b) to more actively weave citizen participation into DevDays itself. </p>\n<p>We would blog some optional homework reading in advance about FHIR, and do some simple demonstrations like that thing I love where you type or paste in a URL and get back a piece of health data.  (I know that's trivial to YOU, but to the data-starved public it's miraculous, and will stimulate lots of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"251396\">@John Keyes</span> imitators to start exploring.)</p>\n<p>What do you think?</p>",
