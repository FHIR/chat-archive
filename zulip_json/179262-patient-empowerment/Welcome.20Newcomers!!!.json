The page is designed to help you get up to speed quick in participating in our work.  Even includes a video which demonstrates what to do to get signed up everywhere and get involved and walks through how we do things. Its like our onramp.   It also might be helpful in general if you are new to HL7 and want to contribute.  <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97473026\">https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97473026</a>.</p>\n<p>This is different from our overall purpose and the latest news for our group which you can find on our main page:  <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PE/Patient+Empowerment+Home\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PE/Patient+Empowerment+Home</a></p>",
