Big thank you if you set that up in advanced of the connectathon.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/SL9GssxfD4NlBZDt3kMFJgwI/PatientCorrections-Epic-Documentation-TestPatients.png\">PatientCorrections-Epic-Documentation-TestPatients.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/SL9GssxfD4NlBZDt3kMFJgwI/PatientCorrections-Epic-Documentation-TestPatients.png\" title=\"PatientCorrections-Epic-Documentation-TestPatients.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/SL9GssxfD4NlBZDt3kMFJgwI/PatientCorrections-Epic-Documentation-TestPatients.png\"></a></div><p>The only concern is that Elijah isn’t available via MyChart.  Which makes it difficult to use the patient for the use case, if we can’t check that the records are updated as the patient would see it.  </p>\n<p>Question:  Would it be possible to get Elijah registered in MyChart?  Alternatively, is there an existing MyChart test patient that we could add smoking history and some clinical notes to?  Maybe Derrick Lin?   Is there anything that needs to be set up on the backend for us to send DocumentReferences into Derrick’s chart?    </p>\n<p>There's a general interest in fetching smoking history and clinical notes from a test patient from the big EHR vendors, so we can populate our Task.input examples with real data, so when it returns to you the Epic systems can digest the request properly.</p>",
