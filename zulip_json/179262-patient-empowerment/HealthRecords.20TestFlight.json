We managed to connect Symptomatic up to HealthKit, and are pulling records in via FHIR, and everything is working great.  But now we're in TestFlight, and it appears people can download Symptomatic Timeline, but it doesn't help them much if they're not near one of the ~70 hospitals piloting Apple HealthRecords.  Ah!  </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/r9K7wGh13NofKFcg9S7UwZH4/Symptomatic-iPhone-HealthRecords.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Symptomatic-iPhone-HealthRecords.png\">Symptomatic-iPhone-HealthRecords.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/r9K7wGh13NofKFcg9S7UwZH4/Symptomatic-iPhone-HealthRecords.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Symptomatic-iPhone-HealthRecords.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/r9K7wGh13NofKFcg9S7UwZH4/Symptomatic-iPhone-HealthRecords.png\"></a></div><p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/eikPh7Fr5zpjrSwnuT5bq-f0/Symptomatic-iPhone-Observations.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Symptomatic-iPhone-Observations.png\">Symptomatic-iPhone-Observations.png</a> <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/dxc3XgeGhpgPnUQeiaNCXzhf/Symptomatic-iPhone-Timeline.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Symptomatic-iPhone-Timeline.png\">Symptomatic-iPhone-Timeline.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/eikPh7Fr5zpjrSwnuT5bq-f0/Symptomatic-iPhone-Observations.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Symptomatic-iPhone-Observations.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/eikPh7Fr5zpjrSwnuT5bq-f0/Symptomatic-iPhone-Observations.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/dxc3XgeGhpgPnUQeiaNCXzhf/Symptomatic-iPhone-Timeline.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Symptomatic-iPhone-Timeline.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/dxc3XgeGhpgPnUQeiaNCXzhf/Symptomatic-iPhone-Timeline.png\"></a></div><p>Anyhow, we're looking for anybody else who's downloaded their own HealthRecords, and might be willing/interested in testing our timeline app.</p>",

I can only imagine that they're being received as FHIR, and that LabCorp and Quest have FHIR endpoints in production now.  All in all, it's working great.  And we were super excited that we could pick that data up via a 3rd party app.</p>",
