The technical means of transfer could be a database export, or an HL7v2 message feed, or FHIR APIs, or anything else.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another pathway for moving data from a provider to an aggregator would be HIPAA's patient right of access, where a patient instructs a healthcare provider to share. This can involve technologies like FHIR APIs for patient access.

HL7 is not an oversight authority and none of the organizations who produced these interfaces necessarily have any obligation to HL7.  It's entirely possible that some of them aren't even members.  There isn't much we could do with such a list.  If anyone is going to receive it, it should be the relevant government agencies - i.e. HHS and FTC.  They have the responsibility around enforcement.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'd be astounded if Touchstone picked up on any of these issues.  Its tests generally focus on \"happy-path\" and it's not really set up to be able to test things like this.  It's theoretically possible that Inferno or the ONC-ATLs might have caught some of this, but I'm not sure they're set up to test this sort of thing right now either.  I'd change this recommendation to be that Inferno and the ONC-ATL should be enhanced to ensure that basic security testing as well as explicitly asserting adherence to a checklist of best practices (e.g. \"None of this software has included hard-coded credentials\") be made part of the certifcation process.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>I'm kind of hoping that Alissa has already done this.  As a white-hat hacker, it's sort of an expectation...</li>\n<li>There was no disclosure here that was relevant to HL7.  Yes, the poorly secured interfaces happened to use FHIR APIs, but the FHIR APIs weren't the issue.  That said, ensuring that HL7 <em>has</em> a disclosure policy and that it's easy to find and understand is probably a good thing for us to do.  That doesn't make sense to include in a letter to government though.</li>\n<li>On board with this, but again, not something for regulators</li>\n<li>I'm not sure that privacy attestations would have helped much here.  I'm sure those who would have signed such attestations for the aggregator apps thought they were fully secure and adhered to all policies.  Establishing a voluntary testing and certification process and a trusted, verifiable mark for apps that have gone through the process isn't a bad idea</li>\n</ol>",

We have zero expertise (or capacity) for doing that.  If there's a flaw in our specifications or any of the very limited amount of code we distribute (we've had issues with shared XSLTs once), then we absolutely need to fix those.  But we have no authority or capability to do anything more than say \"we think you should do X\".  (And at the international/base FHIR level, we have limitations even there, because we can't mandate what needs to be secured, nor how - those decisions are made much closer to implementation and aren't the kind of thing we can mandate across all FHIR implementations worldwide.</p>\n<p>What we <em>can</em> do is start to set expectations that implementation guides all have a section on \"Security &amp; Privacy\" that documents specific risks and mitigations that are relevant to that IG, including any mandatory security technologies that need to be employed and any constraints on how those are configured and used.  Some accelerators are already doing this.</p>\n<p>Part of the issue is that standards, are by definitions, building blocks used to define overall solutions.  They're built that way deliberately to allow re-use and reduce fragility/brittleness.  The second problem is that, for most standards, there are few resources available for basic testing, let alone penetration testing.  ONC may be able to fund some for US Core, but I don't know we can expect the same for Gravity, mCode or the other accelerators, much less for the plethora of IGs developed outside the accelerator space.</p>",
