We compared one of our bundles to the example in the guide and they both look correct but generate several errors.    If we remove the \"admit-notification-header\" profile from the message header in the example message we don't see the errors but also don't get the complete validation.   The results from running the hapi validator against the ig example at  <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-alerts/Bundle-admit-notification-message-bundle-01.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-alerts/Bundle-admit-notification-message-bundle-01.html</a> are attached.   <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/FHw1tp6dEkpoF_gn6xNMDyF4/admit-notification-validation-result.txt\">admit-notification-validation-result.txt</a>    any advise?   thanks</p>",
