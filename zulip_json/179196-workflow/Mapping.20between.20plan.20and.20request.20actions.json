In fact, the ultimate goal is to be able to trace QuestionnaireReponses or Observations to a specific action of a PlanDefinition. This PlanDefinition can have multiple actions to fill out the same Quesitonnaire. <br>\nAs far as i know the only way to do this is to create a ResourceGroup with matching actions (or CarePlan.activities) by using <a href=\"http://Element.id\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Element.id\">Element.id</a> as it is described in the section <em>Applying a PlanDefinition</em> of the PlanDefinition page:<br>\n\"Create an action element in the RequestGroup with the same id as the action being processed\"<br>\nBut for me this seems like secretly using this \"Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references)\" for external referencing.<br>\nWould it make sense to introduce something similar to the Questionnaire/QuestionnaireResponse.linkId for this? Or is there another way to do this (besides defining my own extensions)?</p>\n<p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>",
