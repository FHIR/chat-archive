If you're willing to do the latter, I'll need an email from you agreeing to monitor the committer stream here on Zulip for changes to commit rules (freezes, etc.) as well as conforming that you've read and agree to abide by chapter 16 of the HL7 GOM (<a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/HL7_Governance_and_Operations_Manual.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/HL7_Governance_and_Operations_Manual.pdf\">http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/HL7_Governance_and_Operations_Manual.pdf</a>).
