What is important in ActionDefinition is to allow branching (not yet supported I think), similar to nextStep in Protocol.</p>\n<p>Concerning \"tumor board\" I am talking about the multi disciplinary team meeting. Tumor board is a special MDTM concerning oncology. In the board treatment suggestions for patient cases are made by professionals of mutliple disciplines. </p>\n<p>How this connects to protocol in my mind is a definition of how the tumor board should be conducted (who, as in what professions, gets invited; what patient cases will be discussed; what guidelines for treatment exist; ...). Currently there are some guidelines in place on these matters, and hospitals have an internal process-definition (eg. in BPMN) which could be  modeled as protocol in FHIR.</p>",
