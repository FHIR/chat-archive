Is there a recommendation to leverage the common extensions versus creating resource-specific extensions?  If so, should we be creating extensions when common extension are missing?  For example, I don't see a request-instantiatescanonical -- should I have made <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/extension-communicationrequest-instantiatescanonical.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/extension-communicationrequest-instantiatescanonical.html\">http://build.fhir.org/extension-communicationrequest-instantiatescanonical.html</a> a shared/common extension?</p>",
