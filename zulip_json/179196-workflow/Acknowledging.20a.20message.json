The status of the referral is (usually) managed by a Task (based on  the ServiceRequest that is the referral). If you want to bring FHIR messaging and referral management together, you can then have something like this:</p>\n<p>Referral Request --&gt; FHIR message with MessageHeader.focus pointing to Task, with Task.status set to requested, and containing the rest of the relevant resources<br>\nSynchronous Ack --&gt; FHIR message with MessageHeader.respopnse.code of OK<br>\nReferral Accept --&gt; FHIR message with MessageHeader.focus pointing to Task, with Task.Status set to accepted</p>\n<p>Of course, there are many variations possible to the above, for example the synchronous ack may have a focus of Task as well, with Task.status set to received.</p>",

I am all for combining various standards in a single implementation guide, but in my opinion, it is better to provide a layer in the content that deals with the states of the information exchange. Just throwing a FHIR Task in the mix of other standards without other FHIR pieces involved might not be what you are looking for.</p>",
