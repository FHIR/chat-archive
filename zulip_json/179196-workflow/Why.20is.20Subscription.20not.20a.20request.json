We have a pattern to avoid weird ways of doing that kind of stuff. Say a committees wants to create a resource like \"TransplantNeeded\". or worse, a resource called \"Transplant\" with a mood/status flag \"needed / done\"  - this is what the pattern is avoiding.</p>\n<p><strong>Subscription</strong> seems a technical way for a system to enable another to send it updates of whatever is on the server that matches some criteria. It is not an actionable request as the former. So I understand it is not in the request.  I can understand that it implies some functionality, but it is not in the level of the requests. Perhaps <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191401\">@Eric Haas</span> is looking at it from a purely functional perspective, where it would make sense to keep track of subscriptions, e.g. for auditing purposes. We could address that but at a first glance i don't equate Subscription and Request. but there is no harm in seeing what could be harmonized there, as a one-off.</p>",
