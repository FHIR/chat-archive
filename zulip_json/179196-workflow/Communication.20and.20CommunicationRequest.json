        "content": "<p>At the connectathon, we imagined a conversation chain that could be supported using the Communication resource  that would emulate secure messaging.  It would look like the following (this is an example scenario conversational scenario which stops and starts back up over time):<br>\nParty A creates a text message to Party B and embeds in Communication resource 1.<br>\nParty B creates a text message to Party A and embeds in new Communication resource  2 with a pointer to Communication resource 1.<br>\nParty B creates a second text message a little later and embeds in new Communication resource 3 with a point to Communication 2.<br>\nParty A create a text message to Party A and embeds in new Communication resource 4 with a pointer to Communication resource 3.<br>\nParty A a while later creates an additional text message and embeds in new Communciation resource 5 with a pointer to Communication resource 4.</p>\n<p>I learned from <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191404\">@John Moehrke</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192205\">@Lisa Nelson</span>  that this is not how a communication would work with FHIR and that instead you would need combinations of CommunicationRequest and Communication, which feels very unnatural for me for this use case.  I do not want to request that someone communicates and then record that communication occurred and its not necessarily a request/response thing.  One side could talk and the other side could just listen for example. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192825\">@Jeffrey Danford</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192685\">@Vassil Peytchev</span> </p>\n<p>In general I have a hard time with the use cases for CommunicationRequest except for the idea that I request that someone else communication with a third party.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"225094\">@Debi Willis</span></p>",

CommunicationRequest is used to say \"please share the following information with 'someone'\".  It would not be appropriate to use that if all you're doing is the equivalent of a secure email.  CommunicationRequest would make sense if you wanted to say \"please share lab result X with Dr. Jones\"</p>",

Requestor, just like with Task learns of the response by querying for Communication resources.  </p>\n<p>So Requestor (client) does Post and Read/Search of Communication resources.  Fulfiller accepts Posts and Read/Search.</p>\n<p>I think this is similar to the use of Task.notes.</p>\n<p>The benefit of this is you could, in a more formal and richer way log actual correspondence as well as log evidence of correspondence (called patient on Friday and discussed X).</p>\n<p>But again, I think Task.note works for this OK.  I do not think its good for official correspondence such as the response that shows patient their correction request has been accepted and corrected and shows evidence or that it has been denied, explains why, and explains patient's right to disagree, I think that Task.output would be more appropriate for that</p>",
