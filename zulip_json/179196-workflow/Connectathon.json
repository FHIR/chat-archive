We know there is no workflow track, but since we want to try out the ideas discussed in the FHIR-Workflow-Calls we would like to test it.</p>\n<p>Our initial question would be if anybody is interested in participating, and if you have a preferred option (Request-Event, or Request-Task)? We gravitate either towards option C or option H. In any case I am planning to play 3rd party intermediary during the connectathon, but am happy to play placer|fullfiller if anyone else wants to implement the intermediary. </p>\n<p>Please let us know if you are interested in connectathoning with us.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nOliver</p>",

In the Monday-Workflow call we discussed the possibility of doing a hackathon-track at one of the upcoming WGM CATs, specifically concerning the Request-Event pattern (<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/workflow.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/workflow.html\">http://build.fhir.org/workflow.html</a>) and with that the communication patterns (<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/workflow.html#commpatterns\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/workflow.html#commpatterns\">http://build.fhir.org/workflow.html#commpatterns</a>). What I would like to know from you is, if you are interested in testing those patterns, and which ones you need for your use-cases. </p>\n<p>From the talks yesterday I gathered that use cases from the medication or laboratory domain would be prominent. So right now I am thinking about a Pharmacy MedicationRequest Use Case but am open to suggestions or additional requirements/use cases from other domains.</p>\n<p>If you have any interest in contributing to a potential track (SanAntonio or any other upcoming WGM) please let us know, even if you canâ€™t commit resources (yet). The first step is just to see if we do have a need for a track. So just drop a reply here, or drop me a mail.</p>",
