As of today, in R5 the ValueSet <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/valueset-dose-rate-type.html#4.4.1.208\">DoseAndRateType</a> has only two values \"calculated\" and \"ordered\". However, the binding is \"example\", which seems a bit strange to me, for a ValueSet which is part of the base standard, used to provide the meaning of a type of dose and rate. Does this mean that the value set is not really determined yet? OR should we change the binding to \"required\"?</p>",
