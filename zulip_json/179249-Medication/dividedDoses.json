I was looking for a flag to denote that the recommended amount of medication should be divided into multiple administrations. Something like 500 – 1,000 mg/day (starting dose, adjust based on efficacy and tolerability to a maximum of 2,000 mg/day) divided into 1 – 4 daily doses PO on Days 1 – 28</p>",
