According to IDMP 11238, and up until FHIR R5 Preview #1, the ATC codes are/were supposed to be added to the SubstanceReferenceInformation.classification.classification attribute.  However, that attribute is missing after FHIR R5 Preview #2, and we are wondering where to put the ATC codes instead (unable to find relevant documentation or examples). Can anyone help? Thank you very much!</p>",
