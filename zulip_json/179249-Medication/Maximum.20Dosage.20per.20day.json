Where do we hold the maximum daily dosage of 4 tables?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks for the response Richard. The issue we were hinting at was around there being  2 doses per day, and each dose being different (therefore 2 dosageInsructions),  and how to represent a total daily dosage. The dosage.maxDosePerPeriod is on the dosage structure (for which we'd use 2 in this example) - so it's a bit strange duplicating the maxDosePerPeriod on both dosages?</p>",

It fits with FHIR as primarily a tool for exchange, not for a normalised data base.</p>",
