The first step involves processing the insurance, counting the pills, sticking them in a bottle, printing the label, reviewing the order to ensure it's right &amp; complete, and putting the meds in a bag.  The second involves receiving payment and handing the pills to the patient.  If a patient doesn't show up, then you need to reverse some of the first set of steps.</p>",
