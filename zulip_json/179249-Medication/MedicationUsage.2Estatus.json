I also think 'completed' is going to be a confusing name - because 'completed' meant something completely different in MedicationUsage.  My leaning would be just having two statuses - \"recorded\" and \"entered-in-error\".  Default status is 'recorded'.  If you don't have evidence that something is 'entered-in-error', then you always presume it's accurate information (or at least \"as accurate as usual\").</p>",
