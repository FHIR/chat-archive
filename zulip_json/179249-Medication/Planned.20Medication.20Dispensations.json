What would be the best way of providing the planned dispensations to the machine? With planned dispensation I mean e.g. pills to be given to a patient which need to be prepared, based on an medication order.</p>\n<p>Some options we have discussed:</p>\n<p><strong>Option 1 - List resource</strong><br>\nUse the List resource with a code=plannedDispensations. The List would include entries of type MedicationRequest. Ideally we would also do some profiling on the MedicationRequest entries adapting them for the dispensation use case (not sure if you can bind specific profiles of the entry resources to the List.code value?).</p>\n<p><strong>Option 2 - Medication Request</strong><br>\nUse the MedicationRequest resource directly without a list. We would probably have a profile specifically for adapting the MedicationRequest to the dispensation use case as well.</p>\n<p>Maybe there are other better options?</p>\n<p>Any recommendations of how to in the best way expose planned dispensations?</p>",
