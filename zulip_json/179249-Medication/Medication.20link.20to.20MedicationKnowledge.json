ATC code, schedule, other attributes. The other instance resources have a link to the Definition, I see no reason why Medication doesn't link to Knowledge. </p>\n<p>Especially for contained resources in a presciption, we need to establish a link between them. We could add an extension, but this seems a core thing - to align with other resources, and because I think linking with codes won't work.</p>",
