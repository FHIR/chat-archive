Often the strength of the medication in the tablet or capsule is included in the name of the medication from the code.  There may be situations where one strength is prescribed or dispensed but the patient is to take a different amount.  For example, 4mg tablets may be dispensed but the actual dose that the patient is to take is 8mg - this can be conveyed in the Dosage.doseAndRate.doseQuantity</p>",

Yes, I do understand dispensed might be different than prescribed, but I would expect the patient would be entering the dispensed details, then indicating how many of them they are taking etc...  Surely there will be exceptions, I am not looking at them.</p>",
