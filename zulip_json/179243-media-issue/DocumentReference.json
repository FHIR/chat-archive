Depending on where we draw the boundaries around Media, it will influence how DocumentReference is used. Is Media imaging/video/audio and DocumentReference everything else? Is Media \"clinical content,\" and DocumentReference everything else? If Observation is the interpretation and Media is the underlying data (for at least some types of underlying data), then given that DocumentReference can capture much of the clinical context of that underlying data anyhow, why do we need both DocumentReference and Media?</p>",

DocumentReference is all about the document and DocumentRetrieval  I would not consider it a freestanding Observation.
