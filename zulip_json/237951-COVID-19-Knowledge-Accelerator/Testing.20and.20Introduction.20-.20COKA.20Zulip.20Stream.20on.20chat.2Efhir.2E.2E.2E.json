The most obvious difference is that HAPI is in Java and Vonk is in .NET Core. <br>\nDepending on the FHIR features you need, one may have an advantage over the other, but all the common FHIR features are covered by both. <br>\nHapi has Interceptors to add behaviour to the server, Vonk allows for plugins that are dynamically loaded.<br>\nAfaik only Vonk has the capability to add custom resource types (and search parameters on them) - even at runtime. That makes it easy to experiment with new and evolving resourcetypes like Citation.<br>\nGetting started with Vonk will take you about 5 minutes, instructions are <a href=\"http://docs.simplifier.net/vonk/getting_started.html\">here</a>. And the community edition is free to use.</p>",
