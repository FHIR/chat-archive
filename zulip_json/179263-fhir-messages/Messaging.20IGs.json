I've been wondering if FHIR Messages should related to HL7v2, so the Patient, Encounter and DocumentReference focused messages should have similar structure to v2 equivalents. <br>\nIt would make transform easier and so adoption. <br>\nNot seeing this as negative, as for example our national v2 Patient messages (A28/31) already focused on Patient (PID) changing. In our patient encounter management , it's mostly the Encounter (PV1) that changes and support for other resources is variable.</p>",

We use a common messageheader (a medcom core, not DK core), with a value-set for eventcoding for the two messagetypes (and more to come). Since focus is not the same in our messages, we have a separate messageheader for each messagetype.  Comments will be appreciated</p>",
