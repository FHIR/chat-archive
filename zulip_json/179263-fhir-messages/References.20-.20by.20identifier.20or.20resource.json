Currently one gets a notification of the event (EVN, MessageHeader) only, or event + focal resource. They've started the discussion of how to specify in a subscription what the scope should be of what should be in the notification. IMHO this directly relates to how FHIR might/should support messaging in a more modern way than perhaps in v2/v3. <br>\n(v2 is still the best solution for certain workflows, so you won't hear me commenting about that aspect of your comment)</p>\n<p>IMHO those that have an interest in Subscriptions and those that have an interest in Messaging should be sitting at one table to hash out something that'll work for both exchange mechanisms - they're too close to ignore the overlap.</p>",
