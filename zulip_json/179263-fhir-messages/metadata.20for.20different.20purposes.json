Furthermore the fhir messages will be placed together with other non-fhir messages in a fhir repository for use in an xds infrastructure.</p>\n<p>My thoughts around this is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to handle fhir messaging using the Bundle as a message type </li>\n<li>to handle the message stored in the fhir repository together with non-fhir messages in a profiled Communication resource</li>\n<li>to use DocumentReference as the metadata carrier across the different \"platforms\" and to pull metadata from this to the messaging non-fhir envelope and later to be part of the Communication resource and be the source for registration in the XDS Registry</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It will of course complicate the fhir message with doubled metadata information as these data also will be part of other resources in the fhir message, but it will ease the automation of extracting metadata across different needs.</p>\n<p>Your thoughts?</p>",

It is also documented this way in the IHE MHD profile (I am the author)<br>\nStoring a FHIR Message like this is not a problem. As long as your community understands what it is they are finding. Recommend you define a FormatCode. Some environments have done this, less so with full messages, more so with purpose specific bundles (a bundle of current medications).<br>\nIn this way, when a new FHIR Message of the same purpose is received, will you 'replace' (XDS replace) the previous so as to limit unnecessary duplication?<br>\nI would like to see this promoted as a document content type in IHE...<br>\nIf this is the target, then why store them as Communication resources? Why not just go direct to DocumentReference? What do you expect to get out of the communication resource?</p>",
