The code element appears the be the right place and it is bound to \"PractitionerRole Code\"  (<a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/ValueSet-PractitionerRoleVS.html\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/ValueSet-PractitionerRoleVS.html</a>)  I don't see a good option for indicating PCP here.  </p>\n<p>I did find that this value set <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-practitioner-role.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-practitioner-role.html</a> includes PCP as it includes codes form SNOMED.  It would seem based on the IG though that I can't use this valueset and am required to use the set for plan-net.</p>\n<p>Thanks for any help you may provide.</p>\n<p>Fred</p>",
