The OrganizationAffiliation:network absence is an oversight, since the SP is explicitly included in the IG.   Fixed.  </p>\n<p>WRT InsurancePlan:network, we added it, and then deleted it.   The reason is that it isn't straightforward, since there is both InsurancePlan.network, and InsurancePlan.plan.network.   For a particular member associated with a specific InsurancePlan product/plan, the networks will be a combination of those that apply to all plans within the product (InsurancePlan.network) and those that apply to a specific plan (InsurancePlan.plan[i].network).   So, we will leave it to the client to retrieve the InsurancePlan instance, and figure out which networks are relevant.</p>",
