Plannet-Organization and Plannet-Network are both profiles of the Organization resource.   The capability statement is organized by resource, not profile.   The coverage-area search parameter <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/SearchParameter-organization-coverage-area.html\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/SearchParameter-organization-coverage-area.html</a> references an extension found in the Network profile.   You will come up empty if you try to use it to operate on Organization instances that are not instances of the Plannet-Network profile that include a referenced location (coverage area).</p>",
