It conveys information about the provider that is an organization just as information about a provider that is a person is conveyed in Practitioner Role. In this case, it can be used to convey qualifications that are specific to an organization provider but only for a specific component of that provider. </p>\n<p>For example, a payer might contract with a hospital and under that contract is the acute care facility and an ambulatory surgical center. Both the acute care facility and the urgent care center have JCAHO accreditations. In this instance, there would be two Organizational Affiliation resources, one with the specialty for acute care hospital and the hospital's JCAHO accreditation and another with the specialty for ambulatory  surgical center and the JCAHO ambulatory health care accreditation.</p>",
