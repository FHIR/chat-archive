There are three codes that characterize the service:   category,   type (the one you mention above) and specialty.   Irrespective of the service, the profile provides the fields to support a description of when the service itself is available, and, independently, when the contact point is available.</p>\n<p>So, if the service is a pain clinic, one might expect that the category would be 'outpat', the type might be 'pain', and the specialty could be Pain Medicine (Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation) Physician.   They might have a 24 hour contact phone number (contact-availabletime) but the clinic might be open only 2-4pm on Wednesdays.</p>",
