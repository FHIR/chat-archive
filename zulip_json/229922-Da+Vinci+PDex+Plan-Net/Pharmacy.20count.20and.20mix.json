The pharmacy specialty is provided in the OrganizationAffiliation instance, so to filter by compounding pharmacy the query would be:<br>\n<a href=\"https://davinci-plan-net-ri.logicahealth.org/fhir/OrganizationAffiliation?network=Organization/plannet-network-HPID010000&amp;_include=OrganizationAffiliation:location&amp;location.type=OUTPHARM&amp;specialty=3336C0004X\">https://davinci-plan-net-ri.logicahealth.org/fhir/OrganizationAffiliation?network=Organization/plannet-network-HPID010000&amp;_include=OrganizationAffiliation:location&amp;location.type=OUTPHARM&amp;specialty=3336C0004X</a></p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nSaul</p>",

        "content": "<p>Yes, I thought about counting the pharmacies - or more specifically using the <a href=\"http://Bundle.total\">Bundle.total</a>.  And doing the same for each specialties - which requires the requester to request each specialty.  Alternatively, request all pharmacies including their specialty(ies) (count=Bundle.total) and then analyzing the returned pharmacies by specialty (to get the mix).</p>\n<p>I'm concerned with this approach for reporting the mix.  When CMS indicates they want information in a report, they usually do not mean \"provide enough data so the receiver can derive the specified information\".   Is there any info from CMS in this regard?  </p>\n<p>I submit a question to CMS, but my connection to CMS is indirect and may take some time.</p>",

So, some minimal processing of the bundle will be required by the client.  This question has arisen previously, and CMS is aware of the approach.   I'm not sure their awareness has been communicated.  I am not a CMS spokesperson.</p>",
