Am I correct in assuming that this bulk API would be based on FHIR bulk $export spec (<a href=\"https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/export/index.html#endpoint---system-level-export\">https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/export/index.html#endpoint---system-level-export</a>)?  And are any payers actively working on or planning to support that capability in the next year?</p>\n<p>My company's EHR product is very interested to include specialist in-network status into our referral workflows, but some form of background data sync is much preferred over real-time call to payer API because we need to incorporate additional search and sort criteria that exist only within our EHR product.</p>",
