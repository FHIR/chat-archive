I get an error \"Remote reference not supported\".  </p>\n<p>I'm curious if there is a version or if anyone has a version of the swagger file that doesn't have references to external files.  I imagine I can go grab the contents of all the external files and pull them into a single swagger file but I'm not sure exactly what that would look like yet.   Thought I would start here.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>Fred</p>",
