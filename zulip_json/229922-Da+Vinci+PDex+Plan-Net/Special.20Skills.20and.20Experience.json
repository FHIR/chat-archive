The binding here is extensible so if it is not present in the value set, additional coding may be used. There is also HealthcareService.characteristic but there is no value set specified. I would encourage consistent use of HealthcareService.type. Additional values you might look into for use there since it is extensible is the NUCC Provider Characteristics code set. There are a lot of useful values in this code set. <a href=\"https://www.nucc.org/index.php/code-sets-mainmenu-41/provider-characteristics-mainmenu-39/code-lookup-mainmenu-63\">https://www.nucc.org/index.php/code-sets-mainmenu-41/provider-characteristics-mainmenu-39/code-lookup-mainmenu-63</a></p>",
