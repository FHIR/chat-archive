These are often key elements for searching or filtering results by.  If we use the OrganizationAffiliation.specialty element for representing the contract, there is a taxonomy code for retail. But it is a required binding and so we are unable to add addition qualifications to the type of retail.  Has this been brought up? This is common across PBMs so I would think we would want a consistent element/way of denoting this.  If we are using the .specialty element, it feels like it should be an extension directly on one taxonomy code.</p>\n<p>Here's the type of contracts/networks that we support in our directories today:</p>\n<p>Standard Retail - Taxonomy 3336C0003X   Community/Retail Pharmacy<br>\nPreferred Retail - Taxonomy 3336C0003X  Community/Retail Pharmacy + a Preferred Indicator<br>\nStandard Extended Supply/90 Day Retail - Taxonomy 3336C0003X    Community/Retail Pharmacy + an Extended Supply Indicator<br>\nPreferred Extended Supply/90 Day Retail - Taxonomy 3336C0003X   Community/Retail Pharmacy + an Extended Supply Indicator + a Preferred Indicator<br>\nStandard Mail Order - Taxonomy 3336M0002X   Mail Order Pharmacy<br>\nPreferred Mail Order- Taxonomy 3336M0002X   Mail Order Pharmacy + a Preferred Indicator<br>\nSpecialty - Taxonomy 3336S0011X Specialty Pharmacy<br>\nSpecialty - [Specific Disease/Drug, like Hemophilia] - Taxonomy 3336S0011X  Specialty Pharmacy + Disease Specific Indicator + Description<br>\nSpecialty-Limited Distribution (*likely not needed at this time but may be needed payer to provider)  - Taxonomy 3336S0011X Specialty Pharmacy + LD indicator<br>\nLong Term Care - Taxonomy 3336L0003X    Long Term Care Pharmacy<br>\nHome Infusion - Taxonomy 3336H0001X Home Infusion Therapy Pharmacy</p>",
