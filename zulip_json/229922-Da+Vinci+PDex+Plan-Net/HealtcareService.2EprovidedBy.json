Would be an issue for a service provided by a solo practitioner for whom there is no associated organization.  Not sure whether the reference that is constrained to an organization reference can be broadened in a profile to include both Organization and Practitioner.  <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-31691?filter=12627\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-31691?filter=12627</a><br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"231038\">@Gail Kocher</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"215603\">@Sean Mahoney</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196359\">@Robert Dieterle</span></p>",
