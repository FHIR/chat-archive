The version that is out there still references dependencies for \"hl7.fhir.core\": \"4.0.0\" when the latest in Git Hub reference dependencies for \"hl7.fhir.r4.core\": \"4.0.1\",  \"hl7.fhir.us.core\": \"3.1.0\" .</p>\n<p>I mainly ask because the software I import these profile packages into uses the exact output from the FHIR registry and I'm not sure how to turn the FSH files on Github into that myself.</p>\n<p>If anyone here has a way to get the Registry update, that would be extremely helpful.  I do realize this isn't a finalized spec, but having something more up to date on the registry would be helpful.  </p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>Fred</p>",
