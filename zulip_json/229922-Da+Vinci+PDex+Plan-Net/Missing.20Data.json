        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"215604\">@Saul Kravitz</span> Follow up on this question.  When an implementation does not support/ever provide data for a Must Support element, is that valid?  For example, if a system simply never supplies a value for say, PractitionerRole.organization on any returned PractitionerRole resource, meaning they effectively cannot meet the criteria for searching by PractitionerRole.organization as laid out by the Capabilities Statement which indicate that is a 'shall' support search.  Or are they compliant if when that type of search is done, they simply return no values?  <br>\n<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/CapabilityStatement-plan-net.html#practitionerrole\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/CapabilityStatement-plan-net.html#practitionerrole</a></p>\n<p>We are trying to hone the tests for Plan-Net and and want to ensure the tests are  interpreting the spec guidance correctly.  Thanks!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194116\">@Carie Hammond</span> .   My interpretation of the IG (<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/implementation.html#must-support-1\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/implementation.html#must-support-1</a>) is that if an element is MS with min cardinality 0 -- <em>In situations where information on a particular Must Support data element is not present and the minimum cardinality is 0 , the Health Plan API actors SHALL NOT include the data elements in the resource instance returned as part of the query results.</em>   Translation:  if you don't have the data, you can't conjure it up.   They are compliant if they support the search, and return no values.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if the element is MS with min cardinality &gt;0,  a data absent reason is required, and the search must be supported, but the search would return no values.</p>",

We'll update our tests to ensure that we aren't being overly persnickety for data elements that an implementation simply does not have when we attempt to test the required searches.</p>",
