The purpose of all of the SHALLs in the Plan-Net capability statement is to enable a client to be able to exercise those capabilities.  So, the fact that the reference client doesn't use those capabilities does not detract from the SHALL in the IG.</p>\n<p>For each of the use cases demonstrated by the reference client (except, inadvertently, pharmacy mix), the query used is shown at the top of the screen.<br>\n1) In the provider search (in the RI), the focal resource is PractitionerRole.   Location searches could easily be part of a provider directory search, that is why they are <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pdex-plan-net/CapabilityStatement-plan-net.html#location\">SHALL</a>.   For example, searching for all locations associated with an organization (e.g., hospital network), or all organizations of a certain type (e.g., hospital).   Searching by location (with _lastUpdated, and either all locations or by _id) would likely also be part of a clients ongoing effort to maintain an up to date picture of an evolving directory content.<br>\n2).  For how to use the various profiles, please see <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pdex-plan-net/implementation.html#Representing\">Representing and Searching Provider Directory Data</a></p>",
