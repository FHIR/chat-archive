I haven't really looked at Packages2 so far, and I don't know exactly what it's role is (i.e. what are the implications when the Packages2 server is down?).  As far as I know, restarting as you have done should work.  But since it isn't, what are you seeing in the log?  If I get access I could try to take a look and see if I can come up with any ides (or better yet, solutions).</p>",
