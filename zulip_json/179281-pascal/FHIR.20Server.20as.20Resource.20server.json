Is it possible to use other system side oAuth2 authorization and then access resources and insert them on FHIR server with use of an external access token in the JWT format? On one side is Delphi FHIR server and on other side is system which performs oAuth2 authorization and sends request with its approved access token. How should I set up FHIR server and start session with it? For example if I want to get Appointment info with request like </p>\n<p>GET <a href=\"https://localhost:966/r4/Appointment/12\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://localhost:966/r4/Appointment/12\">https://localhost:966/r4/Appointment/12</a> with header Authorization: Bearer AccessToken</p>\n<p>what steps I have to do to accept such request on FHIR server? How does outside system send GET and POST requests?<br>\nThanks in advance</p>",

        "content": "<p>well, this isn't currently possible. To make it possible, you need some private interface between the OAuth server and the FHIR Server, and you need to set up session management as a slave to the OAuth server. This is possible, but it's going to be quite a lot of programming</p>",
