I think ITI needs to have a discussion on these, possibly creating a set of CP, corrections, revisions, etc. Not sure what would be decided to produce. But it seems these are important enough to start a discussion about fixing/clarifying them. <br>\nI created an ITI \"new work item\" to try to work on that plan - <a href=\"https://github.com/IHE/IT-Infrastructure/issues/175\">https://github.com/IHE/IT-Infrastructure/issues/175</a></p>",
