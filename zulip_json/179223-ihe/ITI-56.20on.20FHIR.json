The works you have seen do fall into the category of re-examining a historic use-case under the constraint of using technology consistent with FHIR. Thus they are the same use-cases with a 'mobile' constraint (yeah, I hate mobile, but it is the word we got). Not all FHIR based IHE profiles are designated with \"m\" for mobile, just those that are re-examining a historic use-case.  PLQ has not been brought forward by anyone.</p>",
