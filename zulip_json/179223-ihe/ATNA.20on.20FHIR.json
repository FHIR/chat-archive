A strong reason for us to not find priority to documenting it is that it seems very obvious to us what a predominant FHIR based application would use to record an AuditEvent. Thus we figure that the audience that needs to hear about a FHIR based method of recording an AuditEvent using http POST is likely to already have figured it out without us having a dedicated profile/option/transaction for it.
