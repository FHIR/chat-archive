This can be 1) Location becomes inactive at a specific date (closes) or opens; 2) Location is temporary, like a school vaccination site; 3) A Location's managingOrganization changes on a date such as when administrative areas split or merge. </p>\n<p>However, there's no such thing in the Location resource to have start/end dates. Is this a job for mCSD, extensions/profiling, or proposed change to FHIR itself? I could terribly off-course here, so any suggestions welcome. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"193299\">@Luke Duncan</span> Edit: I should probably add that this is more to be used in aggregate reporting by subnational units.</p>",
