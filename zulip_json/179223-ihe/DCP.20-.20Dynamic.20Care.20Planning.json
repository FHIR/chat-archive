Correct ? Response: I'm not sure I understand the question. Would the \"one requested activity\" have references to the multiple worflow resources? If yes, why is it not contained anymore? It's linked (like Chaining). Wouldn't FHIR support the traversing of the linkages? If not, couldn't Resource Linkage be used?</p>",
