It provides guidance on the use of one or more standards for a particular use case. <br>\nI think Grahame is seeing that that translates into an Implementation Guide for the FHIR portions of the profile; which is distributed as a package. If there were other standards involved in that profile, the guidance would be distributed in other packages. Thus the package name should include FHIR since it describes only the FHIR portions. <br>\nJohn thinks that the whole profile would be documented in an Implementation Guide, of which only a part might be FHIR. The whole profile is distributed as a single package. Thus the package name should stop at the profile name, since we don't distribute per-standard guidance. <br>\nFurther, John is looking to the future and seeing the IG process as a way for IHE to get off our current PDF-based distribution, and thus needs to be able to handle multiple standards. Grahame sees the IG process as FHIR only.<br>\nThe fact that most of the IHE's existing FHIR profiling is FHIR-only, with a few FHIR-alternative, won't necessarily hold in the future. Today I was having a discussion about a potential profile passing data back and forth between FHIR and DICOM. You'll need the whole profile to be able to use it.<br>\nAm I close to characterizing this correctly? Does this help?</p>",

The structure of an IG is not to far off of our structure, and it appears to be the preferred way to publish FHIR profiling. I expect, IHE is going to want to move to a single approach for all profiling publication. Publishing FHIR profiles one way, but v2, v3, ebXML, and DICOM profiling another way (or worse, other ways) is going to be a pain. If FHIR publication can't support IGs involving those other standards, we'll have to look to other publishing mechanisms that do.
