These questions are being driven by two factors ( a ) the desire to move the MHD resources to Normative, and ( b ) the MHDS profile that is not backed by XDS and thus needs to be more friendly to a basic FHIR server.</p>\n<p>1) Switch to List away from DocumentManifest. (Been some discussion here already see the DocumentManifest vs List stream)</p>\n<p>2) Change in DocumentReference model from DocumentReference.masterIdentifier moving this function into DocumentReference.content.identifier (moving the element and renaming it)</p>\n<p>3) No longer requiring the server to populate DocumentReference.identifier. Possibly recommending that where XDS metadata DocumentEntry.entryUUID is being mapped, that it be mapped into <a href=\"http://DocumentReference.id\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://DocumentReference.id\">DocumentReference.id</a>.  We can stick with DocumentReference.identifier and just mention that entryUUID only gets added with XDS-on-FHIR?</p>",

This is different from the document uniqueID, which is today saved in DocumentReference.masterIdentifier,  which is somewhat related to Binary/id but does not need to be that. <br>\nI am proposing two very different things:<br>\na ) DocumentReference.masterIdentifier be moved into DocumentReference.content.identifier -- holding the document unique identifier, that is XDS - DocumentEntry.uniqueId <br>\nb ) DocumentReference.identifier does NOT need to be XDS DocumentEntry.entryUUID -- That rather the entryUUID would be represented in <a href=\"http://DocumentReference.id\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://DocumentReference.id\">DocumentReference.id</a> when it is needing to be mapped... which it does not need to be mapped in a system that has a non XDS based persistance, and thus not needing to be mapped in MHDS where there is no XDS but rather just a FHIR Server.</p>",
