The MHD spec lists there some resources like PractitionerResource, Practitioner, Patient, Organization and so on, but there isn't any more detailed information how they are working together when trying to fit an author as specified in the IHE ITI TF-3 specification.<br>\nWhile PractitionerRole seems to be a good fit as describing an author structure (elements for role and speciality, reference to an organization and a practitioner) there are some requirements that can't be covered the standard like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An author of a document can also be a patient (or even a software) which means it shouldn't be represented by a practitioner but maybe a patient or a device. Would one create an extension for that?</li>\n<li>An author can belong to more than one organization (authorInstitution). The PractitionerRole resource however limits this per default to an 0..1 relationship.</li>\n</ul>",
