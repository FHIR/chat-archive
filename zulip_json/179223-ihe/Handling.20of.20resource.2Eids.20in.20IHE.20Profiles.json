        "content": "<p>It is not so much about that something is still not clear, it's more to provide further guidance for implementers.<br>\nWhen an implementer has already experience with FHIR, it's clear that the logical ID of a resource is a rather important thing (for exact searches, performing updates, deletes, building references, working with contained resources etc.). If confrontend with IHE Profiles like MHD on the other hand the <a href=\"http://resource.id\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://resource.id\">resource.id</a> is hardly mentioned at all. Which could lead to some questions like in our case (which is a specific one I agree but still). <br>\nSo I am just suggesting to add some lines in the according Profiles to give information about how, when and when not <a href=\"http://resource.id\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://resource.id\">resource.id</a> is used like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it's not necessary for query / retrieve transactions because for each transaction specific \"Query Search Parameters\" are defined</li>\n<li>but it's important for the contained resources in the bundle like patient, practitioner, organization and especially binary</li>\n<li>how to deal with it in special use cases like for CP-ITI-1113 when multiple repositories are in place or there is an other potential situation of making the logical ID longer than 64 characters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's just an idea that could make the life of implementers easier, especially for those who are confronted with both worlds FHIR and IHE i.e. while implementing components for MHD Document Responder &amp; XDS Document Consumer or the Source equivalents.</p>",
