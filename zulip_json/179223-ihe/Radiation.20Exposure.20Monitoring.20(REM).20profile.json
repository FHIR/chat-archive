I'm interested in retrieving Dose Information from a Dose Info Reporter but I can only find a standardized way by using DICOM and HL7 v2. <br>\nIs there a suggest how to map dosis parameters into a FHIR resource. I think the ImagingStudy resource would be the most obvios for that but I couldn't find any extension.<br>\nWith reference to directive 2013/59/Euratom it would be great to have a standardized way by using FHIR.</p>",

The DICOM Dose SOP classes have been carefully designed with the the assistance of medical physicists and should be the best source of this information. We also want to avoid duplication of information between DICOM and FHIR as duplication introduces all sorts of questions related to source of truth, and proliferation of locations/mechanisms to find this information. I would hesitate to try to design anything in this space without the appropriate experts involved.</p>\n<p>That said, I would support a variation on REM that replaced the v2 communications with FHIR, but this has not been tackled yet. If you feel it is a priority, you should submit a proposal when the IHE RAD domain issues a call for work items in the June/July time frame.</p>",
