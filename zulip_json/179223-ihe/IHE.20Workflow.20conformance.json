Actions beget other actions, which eventually complete and return a result to the caller... some are synchronous (modeled recursively), others asynchronous.  PlanDefinition doesn't really have the capacity too support that in a way that was easy to process via a transform.  The information could be captured, and the recursive structure regenerated, but the complexity of representation just didn't match the way people think.  Accurate representation is good, but making it easy for people to express things the way THEY think rather than the way the computer thinks is really important.  We switch context a lot when we describe what happens.  The XYZ sends message 1 to ABC, which then (context switched to ABC) sends message 2 to DEF.  When it (context switched to DEF) returns (back to ABC), then a result is passed back (popping back to XYZ) to XYZ.</p>\n<p>Gotta get that sense in the resource, and in a way that is natural for the user.</p>",
