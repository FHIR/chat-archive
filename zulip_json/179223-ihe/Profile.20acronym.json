StructureDefinition (what FHIR calls a profile, but is NOT an IHE Profile). a SD is reused potentially in many ImplementationGuides. They have their own canonical URI (In IHE land this is domain.volume2/3.chapter). Even within an IHE profile it is not uncommon for a n\"IHE Transaction\" (which is made up of one or more StructureDefinition) in many IHE Profiles (Implementation Guides). Take for example the XDS Query, which is referenced by XDS, XCA, MPQ, etc.  This is an important molecularity feature, a feature also native supported in FHIR SD.</p>",
