The use of the FormatCode specifies the technical format of the document. The FormatCode is a further specialization more detailed than the mime-type. The FormatCode provides sufficient information to allow any potential document consumer to know if it can process and/or display by identifying a document encoding, structure and template. The actual list of codes is intended to be extensible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...which indicates that this is the definition of a ValueSet.
