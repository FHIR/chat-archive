This would explicitly NOT duplicate the more focused tracks, but would give a chance for this audience to use the IHE Connectathon tooling developed for IHE Profiles using FHIR. Anyone interested?  This broad track is expected to narrow based on WHO signs up. So this Zulip stream-track should be used to show interest, and help focus on a reasonable subset of the 20 IHE Profiles of FHIR.
