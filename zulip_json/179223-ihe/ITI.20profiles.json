The profile tells me, that XDS.documentEntry.creationTime should be mapped to MHD.documentReference.indexed and that MHD.documentReference.created should not be used. According to my understanding I would have expected that XDS.documentEntry.creationTime  is mapped to MHD.documentReference.created because this is the information about the creation of the document. MHD.documentReference.indexed is the information when the DocumentReference Resource instance has been created. Where am I wrong? thx regards Frank</p>",

It does seem that XDS.documentEntry.creationTime is assigned to the wrong FHIR element. It should be DocumentReference.created. I note that the mapping on the FHIR DocumentReference is also incorrect.  I think I can fix FHIR under Quality fixes this week. MHD needs a CP, which we will fix this summer when we align with STU3.</p>",
