The only reason for a next button is if it ties to the web site menu with visual cues.  One should not have to discover hidden pages via this mechanisms.  I am chagrined when I have to make comments regarding basic navigation on ballot comments to make a guide more readable.

And there are some people who <em>do</em> want to read IGs linearly.  Sometimes that's just how they think, sometimes they want to ensure they don't miss anything, sometimes they're doing a formal review and page-by-page is the simplest way to manage it.</p>\n<p>I <em>don't</em> think we should have this be optional.  Either we decide it's a useful feature and all HL7 IGs have it, or we decide it's undesirable and none do.  It shouldn't be a design decision because, as I said, no IGs should be designed with next/prev as a primary navigation feature.  It's intended to be an unobtrusive navigation tool for those readers and those uses of the IG where it's helpful.  Having some IGs that provide it and others that don't simply confuses readers.  (We had negative ballots for the non-Trifolia generated Da Vinci IGs that didn't have this feature - and the Trifolia generated next/previous was more obtrusive and less complete in its navigation.)</p>",
