I ran a local full build, but that didn't make a difference.  So I manually created the folder and unzipped the .tgz file into the folder, which seems to be working except there's a problem with the content.  There are two code system files that both declare a canonical URL of \"urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013\" - CodeSystem-signature-type and CodeSystem-astm-signature-type.  The content appears to be identical.  The latter is referenced in a value set and the former isn't, so I'm going to manually strip references to the former.  However, the main build should be choking on this.  (And I shouldn't have to be manually creating a cache entry for 4.1.0 at all...)</p>",
