No helpful error message and not easy to diagnose even though I knew the cause. I eventually realised I had to update a search parameter to match. But how could I have diagnosed this? I'm not a Java person normally but can I run the build within NetBeans or Eclipse or something, to step the code when it crashes?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Getting the build to run is semi-involved.  You need some Eclipse plugins, plus you can't use the 'current' HAPI code because that's always one version off the version the publisher relies on.  Simplest thing is just look at the java file implicated in the stack trace.  50% of the time, just looking at the code location will give you some solid insight into what's wrong.  If you want to run the build in Eclipse, there's some guidance <a href=\"https://hl7.github.io/docs/core/ide\">here</a> on how to set up your environment.
