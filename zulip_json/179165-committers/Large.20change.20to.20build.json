This change changes ElementDefinition.type so that instead of repeating .type for each combination of type/profile or type/targetProfile, we now have one type, and repeat profile or targetProfile. </p>\n<p>This turned out to cause 100s of changes in the code, and the process of updating was overwhelming for this stage in the process. What I can say is the spec builds. But I would be completely unsurprised to find rendering problems in any of the following places:<br>\n- the tree view of resources or profiles<br>\n- xml and json templates<br>\n- the UML view<br>\nIf there are problems, it will be in the presentation of types for a choice[x] element, or in the allowed targets for a reference</p>\n<p>I'll be doing QA, but the point of this message is to alert you all to not take the correctness of these views for granted right now - check them. </p>\n<p>Also, sadly, I have no idea whether any IGs build correctly. I simply don't have time to check this right now</p>",
