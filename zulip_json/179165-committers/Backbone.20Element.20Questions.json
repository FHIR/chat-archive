(I see the definition for Backbone Element in the spec: “The base definition for elements defined as part of a resource definition”. There seems to be a bit more to it than the definition describes).<br>\n-   Rules for deciding if an element should be a Backbone Element or a Resource: Is it correct to say that a set of info would be a Backbone Element vs a Resource if the set of info isn’t able to exist on its own without further contextual info?<br>\n-   Is it correct to say that in converting UML classes to FHIR resources, that a class would be represented in FHIR as a backbone element if that class has a composition relationship to the “owning class” or has a 1…1 or 1..* relationship with the “owning class”?<br>\n-   Is there any additional doc available about Backbone Elements other than what is published in the spec?<br>\nThanks for any help in clarifying.</p>",
