One of &#39;{&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir&quot;:extension}&#39; is expected. (src = InstanceValidator)\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I eventually figured out this was caused by a code list in another resource (Subscription.status), which had the same name and was processed first.  The validator was apparently trying to parse the SubscriptionStatus resource instances as a value set.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure what the error would look like in reverse (e.g., if the resource came before the value set), but I imagine it would be similar.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n-Gino</p>",
