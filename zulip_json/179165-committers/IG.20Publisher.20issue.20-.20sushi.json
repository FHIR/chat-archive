Sushi successfully creates all the input, although it takes an extended period of time. However, if I then build the IG, because there is a fish directory the publisher runs sushi but effectively errors with a 143 error. I think the publisher is timing out and giving up after about a minute. <br>\nThere are two workarounds. 1. Change the fsh folder to another name so that the publisher doesn't try to run sushi.  or 2. run sushi then change the capability statement.fsh file to another name e.g. add .ignore. Then the publisher runs sushi but doesn't choke on the capability statement but the previously generated capability files are there in the input folder for incorporation into the IG.</p>",
