While I wish it would have been sooner than now, I have committed the changes to a branch and here is the <a href=\"https://github.com/HL7/fhir/compare/CG_RenameSequence\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/HL7/fhir/compare/CG_RenameSequence\">compare</a> and welcome anyone to review.  As you might expect, it is a wide but fairly shallow set of changes, except directly in the resource itself of course.  Probably the next biggest impact was Observation, so wanted to specifically call out to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191401\">@Eric Haas</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191405\">@Rob Hausam</span> - Hopefully I won't interfere with you.<br>\nI am reviewing <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/library-fhir-model-definition-content.xml\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/library-fhir-model-definition-content.xml\">this</a> now in the Clinical Reasoning module as well.  I plan to do the same sort of 'search/replace' here, but wanted to ask <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191359\">@Bryn Rhodes</span> for input.</p>",

Yes, there are a lot of Observation-related changes, but as it is primarily a change to the resource name that should be straightforward.
