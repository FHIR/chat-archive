You can actually see this in the current CI build if you compare the following pages - <a href=\"http://hl7-fhir.github.io/valueset-testscript-operation-codes.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7-fhir.github.io/valueset-testscript-operation-codes.html\">http://hl7-fhir.github.io/valueset-testscript-operation-codes.html</a> and <a href=\"http://hl7-fhir.github.io/codesystem-testscript-operation-codes.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7-fhir.github.io/codesystem-testscript-operation-codes.html\">http://hl7-fhir.github.io/codesystem-testscript-operation-codes.html</a> - which shows your latest updates where you removed 'validate' operation from the codesystem but the valueset expansion still has it.</p>",
