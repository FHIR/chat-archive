Typos, two or three clumsy sentences, a link that was not made into a hyperlink so people could click on it. There was only one sentence that says something wrong (which I thought I had fixed ... could have been merged out by git commits from two different sources). Nothing in any of the xml resources or json examples, all changes were all in the free-text *.md pages. Nothing would result in substantive changes so if it is a lot of work don't bother, they can be fixed in the next ballot. I can submit comments. You have enough to do.</p>\n<p>In any case, the complete read-through was a good exercise.
