We have come to the conclusion (but would still consider any good arguments otherwise) that we should include the changes that we will make for Argonaut alignment and incorporation of the SNOMED CT free set (plus some additional post-ballot feedback).  Plus there are still changes needed in the IPS spec and also very likely in the infrastructure that are needed for all of our slicing to work as specified/intended, and we will need some of your time for that.  Those are all significant and aren't going to be able to be completed prior to Montreal.  We anticipate that some further discussion(s) will be needed in Montreal.  So we would incorporate the results of all of that in the September ballot (with the ballot scope limited to the changes since the January ballot) and officially publish following successful ballot resolution.  In the meantime, though, we would also like to tag a stable snapshot version (as of the end of this week or the first of next week) to be used for the Montreal Connectathon and other subsequent activity prior to the official publication.  This is clearly different than what you are asking, but how does that sound (pro and/or con)?</p>",
