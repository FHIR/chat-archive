They are set automatically by the process that handles ballot spreadsheets.  That process does not change this ballot cycle, even though we're encouraging people to submit tracker items directly.  The process for balloting using trackers is to submit your tracker items, then submit a ballot spreadsheet to the HL7 ballot website that only includes the columns for vote and tracker number.</p>",
