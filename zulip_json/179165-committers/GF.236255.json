For the Chemotherapy regimen representation, we use the timing-daysOfCycle extension, and for offset from some action, we use the relatedAction element in PlanDefinition or RequestGroup to specify the source of the offset. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> , do you have any additional unmet use cases that would require an extension as described in this tracker?</p>",
