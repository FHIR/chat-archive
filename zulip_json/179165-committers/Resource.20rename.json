Given that it is a resource rename, this will impact translations.xml, fhir.ini, hierarchy.xml, history.html, resourcelist.html and status-codes.xml. I would appreciate a review of the check in on these supporting files to make sure the changes are okay. If not, let me know and I will make the necessary fixes.</p>",
