FMG discussed the freeze, and our processes going forward. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Committers are free to commit spelling and grammar changes at will</li>\n<li>all other changes (even changes to examples) have to staged through <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span>. to do this: make your changes locally, check that the build works, then send either of us a svn patch. We will make the changes in batches at times  in consultation with the group of people doing technical QA. (more doco to come about this)</li>\n<li>Substantiative changes need approval from FMG prior to sending us the patch. There's some confusion about what is a 'substantiative change'. The in principle answer is: 'anything that changes how an implementer implements'. If think that there's any chance it might be substantiative, ask either Lloyd, me, or another FMG member for a ruling on whether it's substantiative. </li>\n<li>when you ask for approval of a change from FMG, you need to nominate a task number, and the grounds for the change (e.g. is it from the QA process, or where else?), and send an email to <a href=\"mailto:fmgcontact@hl7.org\" title=\"mailto:fmgcontact@hl7.org\">fmgcontact@hl7.org</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>all committers: please confirm that you understand these processes here now. If you break the rules, your committer privileges will be revoked and your change will be rolled back.</p>",
