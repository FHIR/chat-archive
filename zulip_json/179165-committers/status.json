I did update status-codes.xml where mappings were possible.  I have the following questions:<br>\n1-If I have some new status elements that don't align with current columns, should I add new columns or just don't map them?<br>\n2-If I removed some values that result in a blank column (e.g. nothing maps to the canonical behind-target anymore), should I remove the column?<br>\n3-My local build is failing with a sclist error.  If it isn't related to 1 or 2 above, any other tips on what else I should check?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span> [java] Error: Unable to process sclist (2): Goal.status\n [java] java.lang.Exception: Unable to process sclist (2): Goal.status\n</pre></div>\n\n\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goal.status is no longer a valid element, but I don't know where sclist is getting Goal.status from.....</p>",
