We figured the first step was to document what we consider to be the existing approval process for resources, implementation guides and core profiles.  The FMG reviewed the approval process and agree that it reflects current practice.  We invite feedback from the community on whether any changes are needed.  We'll be discussing this further on next Wednesday's call.  <a href=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Artifact_Governance_Process\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Artifact_Governance_Process\">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Artifact_Governance_Process</a></p>",
