With regard to <a href=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=14118\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=14118\">GF#14118</a> - there's some confusion there. The HL7 table presentation is cross version. That's why it's not shown for a particular version. Instead, the version history is shown for each code. So I'm not going to resolve it by making it version specific. What I'm going to do instead is show the expansion with version if it's anything other than 'all the codes'</p>",

But we can see how it works out (more ballot comments if needed!).  I will try to have all of the important stuff done by 4:00 PM Eastern, but it's pretty tight and I'm not sure that it will all make it.  Had to take time out for the dentist this morning. :(</p>",
