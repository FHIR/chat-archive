However, for the Risk Adjustment use case, we are using MeasureReport to communicate the results of applying a risk adjustment model, but we aren't (yet) using the Measure to specify the risk adjustment model computably, so the Measure doesn't have any groups, but the MeasureReport will have groups for each HCC code that applies to the patient. Can the validation be relaxed so that it's only a violation if the Measure _has_ groups specified? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span></p>",
