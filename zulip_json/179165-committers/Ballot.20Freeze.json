My commit, following your approval would have only been the single xml file for the spreadsheet.

You can verifyu this with the SVN commit logs (look at the individual commits which will show you the files that were commited).  I go to great lengths to ensure that I follow the committer rules (as was evidenced by my requesting permission to perform the commit in question)</p>",
