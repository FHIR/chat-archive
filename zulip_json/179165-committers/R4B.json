The way this would work traditionally is that I would just change the file on master (which already has security permissions and I know works 100%) and then pull the changes into any branches necessary. However, because we're doing this <em>2 master</em> approach, I needed to clone the same build pipeline in the R4B branch that existed already in master, which while almost identical to the PR pipeline in master, is treated as a separate pipeline in Azure. I neglected to enable secure file sharing for that pipeline at the time I created it. Also, the changes needed to be pulled into any live pull request for the build to actually trigger. To solve this I have 1. enabled access to the secure key file for the pipeline (this should solve the problem, although I'm puzzled as to why it didn't recognize the variables when it ran, those are shared...but my test run appeared to work so let's see how Jean's build goes) and 2. asked all of you to pull the latest from R4B into your branches.</p>",
