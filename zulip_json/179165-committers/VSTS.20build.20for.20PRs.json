We can throw as much memory as we need to at this, but right now there's a build server with 16GB RAM willing to run up to 4 jobs at once. It appears to have died running just 2 jobs at once; does a build expect to take more than 8GB RAM? Can we pass arguments to the java process to limit it, or should we just scale up and cross fingers?</p>",
