Also, the validation was super slow.  One AuditEvent instance took over 2 minutes to validate.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191405\">@Rob Hausam</span>, can you see anything wrong?  Tx server seems to be 'up'.  Not sure how to tell if it is (or has been) running into resource limits or something else that would make it slow.</p>",
