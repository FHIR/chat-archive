I noticed that the sample files that you moved to the FHIR Build\\guides\\ccda2 had the word \"composition\" added to the beginning of the name. e.g. composition-ccd-example.xml instead of the previously used naming convention e.g. ccd-example.xml.  </p>\n<p>I wanted to check with you whether it is necessary to add the \"composition\" prefix, and if so, I will update the files I just committed and re-commit them tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>",
