When we first built the IG, we chose CQIF because CQF had already been taken. The IG that uses that though has since been replaced and so is no longer used, so I'd like to change to CQF. So far as I can see, the only impact that would have would be that extensions and profiles that used to start with cqif- will now start with cqf-. And I think that the only change I need to make is igs.xml. Before I go too far down that path, any objections?</p>",
