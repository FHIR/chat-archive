Is there a more comprehensive set of instructions? A pointer to the best page of instructions would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>",

I can't decipher the error messages but it doesn't seem to be related to the Immunization resource. For such a small change, would it be safe to commit the changes and create a pull-request? Once the repository has been downloaded, the actual updating of the spreadsheets and XML files hasn't changed has it? Thanks.</p>",
