How could I get such a page for Medication Definition? <br>\nWe have a category, but there is no clickable title on that page. <br>\nI also think that lots of people take a long time to realise that the module pages actually exist. It's the old UI issue where people don't tend to click the title if the sections are already showing. Equally you don't want to force them to go via an intermediate page. <br>\nMaybe the resource pages should mention the overview page at the top.</p>",
