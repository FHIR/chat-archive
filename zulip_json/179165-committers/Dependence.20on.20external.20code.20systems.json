How it works is:<br>\n- instead of defining the code system in the build, you add it to [externals] in fhir.ini<br>\n- what you add is a literal reference that resolves to the xml or json for the resource <br>\n- the first run, the build tool fetches the resource, and makes a copy in \\vscache\\externals<br>\n- then, you  behave as if the code system is defined in the spec, but it won't be published, and references are made to the source, not the internal copy<br>\n- if you want to update the source, you need to delete the content of \\externals and run again (the build keeps a cache so that it can still run off line, I haven't yet decided if I'm going to periodically update the cache, or just do it myself when I rebuild the cache during the QA period each ballot)</p>",
