HQ is aware and gForge is aware and the hosting provider is being leaned on.  I'll let you know as soon as I know anything further.  In the meantime, if you're wanting to have a clue what trackers are related to \"your stuff\", you can query the tracker XML (hosted on Google) here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/lmckenzie.com/uc?id=0B285oCHDUr09Q2VENW9Ta005QkE\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/a/lmckenzie.com/uc?id=0B285oCHDUr09Q2VENW9Ta005QkE\">https://docs.google.com/a/lmckenzie.com/uc?id=0B285oCHDUr09Q2VENW9Ta005QkE</a></p>",

If anyone's not sure how to find what they need out of the list, let me know and I'll run a query for you.  Host is in Dallas, so they've been awake for a bit, hopefully this won't take too much longer and hopefully we haven't lost any data in the process.</p>",
