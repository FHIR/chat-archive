Here's how it works if you want to layout the UML graphically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there's a generated file in the source directory [n].gen.svg</li>\n<li>rename it to [n].svg</li>\n<li>open it in Inkscape (only inkscape is supported for this option)</li>\n<li>don't worry that the rendering of the text is all wrong in Inkscape</li>\n<li>move the classes around to where you want them</li>\n<li>don't worry about moving anything else (e.g. links, text) - it will all be ignored.  <em>don't move anything else</em> (reasons are deep inside the svg. all you do is move the class boxes).</li>\n<li>save the file</li>\n<li>rebuild</li>\n</ul>",
