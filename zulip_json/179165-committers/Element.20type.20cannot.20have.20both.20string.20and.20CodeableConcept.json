CodeableConcept.text also supports unencoded text but should be used where the characteristic is a concept that might be coded but there is no assigned code for the present value. For example, a security class can be a code like 'Class 1' but in some cases may contain a string like 'Depending on the settings' - in this case the property is normally coded but this is an exception.\"</p>",
