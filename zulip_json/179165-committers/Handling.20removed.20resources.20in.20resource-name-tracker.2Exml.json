These old resources have been disconnected and no HTML page is generated for them in the FHIR publish process. Although this replacement and disconnection was done about a year ago, there's still some traces left of these old resources and I'm working on removing them. One place that they show up is in \"resource-name-tracker.xml.\" Should I delete the rows for these two resources?</p>\n<p>Jira Tracker for this change: <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-26967\" title=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-26967\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-26967</a></p>",
