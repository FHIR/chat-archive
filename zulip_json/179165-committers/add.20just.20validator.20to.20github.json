This is an intermediate step that will go away when we move to full IG publication. I would like to add the FHIR validator to pull requests. Not the whole IG build, just validator. Can someone walk me through how I can do this?    see our github repository <a href=\"https://github.com/IHE/fhir\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/IHE/fhir\">https://github.com/IHE/fhir</a></p>",

I understand that within the IG build, it does a validation on the capabilityStatement, StructureDefinition, etc... to assure that they are well formed. That is, Valid relative to the FHIR schema. When they are not valid, the tool kicks out errors... like we see in the output of the IG build. However I don't have an IG, I just want to have the validator look at all of the files in that GitHub and validate them... this would be part of a Pull Request validation...</p>",
