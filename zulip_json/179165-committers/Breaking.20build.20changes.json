Most data elements have a simple data type, but occasionally they have more complicated structures.  They're commonly used in the research space but in other areas.

However, it's hard to come up with firm boundaries. to deliniate the two.  A couple of differences - A data element <em>must</em> have a definition at the root level.  A logical model might not.  A logical model will always have multiple elements, whereas data elements will often not.  Beyond that, I'm not sure.</p>",
