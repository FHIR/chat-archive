        "content": "<p>I think this is partly the result of some terminology server work that I'm doing.  Previously the terminology server only had support for the Vietnamese variant of ICD-10 (don't ask why!).  We had an error in IPS due to that which I had to work around.  I've been working with Grahame on the general terminology server update process, and we can now add and support additional ICD-10 variants.  The problem is that it's not generally straightforward to get an entire list of the codes for a particular ICD-10 variant (including the \"base\" ICD-10 variant from WHO).  At the moment (within the past hour or so) I've added a small set of \"base\" ICD-10 codes (for system url <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10\">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10</a>).  The downside of doing that is that the validator now starts trying to validate codes with that system url and it will only recognize the codes in that limited set (until others are added).  So there are several potential solutions that I can see.  Maybe the easiest would be for you to give me the set of codes that you want to be able to validate and I will add them for now (that will likely work unless it's a huge set).  The better long-term solution, of course, is to get the full set of ICD-10 codes prepared in a usable format for importing and have the terminology service and therefore also the validator support all of them.</p>",
