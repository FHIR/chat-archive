Procedure.code has an example binding to SNOMED CT, which also isn't freely available for everyone to use (and that's why bindings to SNOMED CT value sets, at least so far, are example).  And since the binding is example, anyone is free to use a different code system / value set if it's applicable, so I think it should be fine to include examples that show that.  That's my take.</p>",

I am specifically asking if FHIR publication/governance rules allow me to put a RadLex code into an example that is published in the core specification. I know there are some rules around use of copy protected codes, but I think they are specific to vocabulary bindings in the model. Thus examples can use any code system. Just wanted confirmation.</p>",
