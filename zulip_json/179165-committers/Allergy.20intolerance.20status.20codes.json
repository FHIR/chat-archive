In addition to preferring use of SNOMED, there was an acknowledgement  that these statuses (for both allergy and condition) had some clinical judgment involved, such that there may need to be more specificity than what the FHIR value set allows.  For example, <a href=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=16193\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=16193\">GF#16193</a> had the scenario where FHIR only has remission in its value set whereas SNOMED allows distinction between partial remission vs full remission.
