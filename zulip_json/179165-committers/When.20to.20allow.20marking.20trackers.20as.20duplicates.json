        "content": "<p>In Jira, it's now no longer possible to mark tracker items as \"duplicates\" unless the target is still \"open\" (i.e. Triaged, Submitted or Waiting-for-input).  The rationale for this is that if someone submits a ballot comment and it gets marked as a duplicate for something already closed, the comment submitter has no opportunity to engage in any discussion around the resolution.  I can (and probably will) revamp to allow linking to 'closed' items where the resolution was persuasive - because in that case, there presumably wouldn't be a need for the submitter to engage.  However, that still leaves all the places where we might previously have pointed to an NP, NPw/mod, Pw/mod, Future use, etc. resolution as no longer available.  What are people's opinions here?  What's the appropriate balance between managability for WGs and ability to be heard for submitters?  Should the limitation only be for \"in person\" items that aren't fully persuasive?  Are there other rules we should have?<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191407\">@Rick Geimer</span> (for triggering this discussion)</p>",
