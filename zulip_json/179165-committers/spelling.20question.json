Outside North America, the preferred participles are modelled and modelling, with two lâ€˜s. Canadians prefer the double-l forms, though the single-l forms appear about a third of the time. (In contrast, the double-l forms are almost nonexistent in 21st-century American writing, and the single-l forms are similarly rare outside North America.) These spelling preferences extend to modeler (U.S.) and modeller (outside the U.S.).</p>",
