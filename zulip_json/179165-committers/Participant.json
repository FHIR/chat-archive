For example, Communication.recipient references Participant.  Did I miss an announcement about that?  Just curious what the next steps should be for <a href=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=22630\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=22630\">GF#22630</a>, which was approved to support a Reference to Endpoint.  Should I reference Participant | Endpoint?  Or, should Participant support Endpoint?</p>",
