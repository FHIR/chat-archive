After a bunch of delving around in the DSTU2 build tooling, I figured out how to cut that to about 20 minutes.  It still builds ALL the profiles, which is something I need to work on further, but I was curious if there is any interest from this group in looking at the rather small changes I made.  I'm fairly certain I'll use the full build for our final delivery, just to be sure everything is clean, but for development, this is saving me a lot of time.</p>",
