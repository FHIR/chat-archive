I told them I would pass a CDA template through Trifolia's FHIR export logic and see what comes out, as a starting point. I did that this morning, and put the results on a GITHUB Gist: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/seanmcilvenna/6be966f3cfa59c7cf7dcb157a8acea75\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/seanmcilvenna/6be966f3cfa59c7cf7dcb157a8acea75\">https://gist.github.com/seanmcilvenna/6be966f3cfa59c7cf7dcb157a8acea75</a><br>\nObviously there are many things wrong with it, but I thought it was interesting to see... If anyone wants to provide some feedback, I'd be interested to see it. Comments on the Gist are welcome (I already threw in some initial thoughts).<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191407\">@Rick Geimer</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192205\">@Lisa Nelson</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191410\">@Brett Marquard</span></p>",
