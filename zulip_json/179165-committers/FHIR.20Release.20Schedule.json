To facilitate discussion, I started writing up some thoughts on the matter.</p>\n<p>However, in doing some background reading I have a couple of questions about the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/versions.html\">FHIR Versions</a> page.  Specifically, the page is Normative and states several times that FHIR releases <em>will</em> happen every 18-24 months.</p>\n<p>I wanted to ask about this before going further, since I'm not sure what to make of it.  To be blunt, I don't think it should've been in that page (at least written the way it is), but since it's describing the release process and is normative, I also think that it probably has some meaning.</p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>",
