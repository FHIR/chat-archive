Looking for help: <br>\nI was going to do a commit but since I saw other commits coming in i decided to wait a bit, so I cancelled my commit in Tortoise. <br>\nNow when I go there again, Tortoise does not show those files for me to commit - i would think they are not committed yet, so why don't they show in my SVN client? I do a \"check for modifications\" and these files don't show as modified.<br>\nAny way I can fix this?</p>",
