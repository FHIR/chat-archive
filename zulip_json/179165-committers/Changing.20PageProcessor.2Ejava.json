I want to change it to \"Statistic\" and \"OrderedDistribution\" respectively. To make this change I need to switch from \"diheader\" in the source HTML to a new header string. I see that in order to do that I need to add new code to PageProcessor.java in the tools folder. Am I allowed to make changes to that file, or do I have to have someone else change it for me?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/statistic.html\">http://build.fhir.org/statistic.html</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ordereddistribution.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ordereddistribution.html</a></p>",
