At first we had it in a  hierarchy, with biologic under medicstion, but not everyone agreed with that and the hierarchy was removed.  So now we can have biologics which are medications (thus needing multiple category values), and also some biologics potentiallly which are not considered to be medications.  I tried to argue against making the change this way, but lost.  I did second the resolution, but I still think that overall this turned out  somewhat strange, including having the value set remain as required.
