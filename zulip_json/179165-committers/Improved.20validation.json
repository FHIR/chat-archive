So it's going to expect that you use value[x] vs. value[foo] appropriately, it'll catch misnamed elements, etc. that the prior process would have missed.  So it may be a good idea to check your build with the new process sooner rather than later to avoid surprises.  (All of the things it complains about would have meant invalid snapshots and thus invalid validation and publication in the past, so it's not changing the rules, just identifying problems it used to miss.)</p>",

Also, there are times when the snapshot will name an element something like valueIdentifier and other times value[x] based on what the constraints on the type are.  If the name in the differential didn't match, it wouldn't flag a problem.  (But hyperlinks in the generated spec wouldn't work.)</p>",
