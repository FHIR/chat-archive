Per <a href=\"#narrow/stream/implementers/topic/OIDs\" title=\"#narrow/stream/implementers/topic/OIDs\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/implementers/topic/OIDs</a>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> said that bindings.ini should prevent that from happening.  Today, after a local build that introduced new value set bindings, I committed bindings.ini, which looks like it had 60+ new bindings auto generated from my local build that were not previously committed.  That leads me to believe that we (committers) are not checking in bindings.ini like we should when a new binding is created.  I wonder if that is the root of the issue behind why OIDs are getting re-assigned between builds and published versions of the spec.</p>",

That's why you don't usually get changes in bindings.ini - I would get them at publication time</p>",
