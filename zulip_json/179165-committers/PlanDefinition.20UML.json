I have changed the StructureDefinition coordinates to make it readable (not checked in yet). However that seems to be ignored because there is a file plandefinition.svg checked in (as well as plandefinition.gen.svg, not checked in). Should I delete plandefinition.svg and rely on the StructureDefinition in future or are we using the SVG as the master somehow?</p>",
