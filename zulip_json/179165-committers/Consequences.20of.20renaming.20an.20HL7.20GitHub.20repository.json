The use case I have involves the Da Vinci group, which recently decided to rename some of their IGs going to a comment-only ballot in May, and so I would like to rename the repositories to match the new acronyms. For example: davinci-ehrx will become davinci-hrex. </p>\n<p>Would like to hear people's thoughts around the consequences, if any, of such a renaming.</p>",
