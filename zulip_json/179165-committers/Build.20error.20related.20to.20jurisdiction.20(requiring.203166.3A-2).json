I'm encountering the build error below when the ImplementationGuide resource and other resources in my IG reference the ISO 3166 code system (versus 3166:-2 noted in the error):<br>\n<em>The resource should declare it's jurisdiction to match the package id (hl7.fhir.us.specialty-rx, jurisdiction = urn:iso:std:iso:3166:-2#US)</em></p>\n<p>I believe that 3166:-2 is the state/province-level subset, and 3166 is the country-level. <br>\nAny ideas why I'm getting the error? </p>\n<p>E.g., Do I have something set wrong elsewhere that's requiring my resource jurisdiction sysetm to be 3166:-2? Or is my understanding of 3166 vs 3166:-2 incorrect?<br>\nThx!</p>",
