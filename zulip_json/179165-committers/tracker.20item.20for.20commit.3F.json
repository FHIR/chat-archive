Is it desirable or necessary to have a tracker item for every commit that is made (and ideally to reference that tracker item with the commit - although we definitely don't always do that).  Or are there specific situations where it is expected that no tracker item is either needed or appropriate?  If so, what are they (and are they specified somewhere)?  We might do that with typos, although we probably have a \"fix all typos\" tracker item that they fall under.  What else?</p>",
