Currently, as far as I know, the narrative is included within the example xml and then is generated when published. This requires that the narrative be included within the example resource. The problem is that if an example generates a large narrative, then the resource gets buried at the bottom of the page and looks ugly. Is there any other way to upload narratives without including them in the example xml?</p>",

And if you're using a tool like Spy, you can collapse the narrative when you're editing.  But there's presently no ability to maintain the narrative separate from the example.  (And I'd be pretty nervous about adding such a capability.)</p>",
