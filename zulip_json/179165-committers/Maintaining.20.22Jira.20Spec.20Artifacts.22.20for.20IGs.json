        "content": "<p>Hi Committers! In our FHIR Management Group calls, we've been discussing some of the overhead and difficult of getting an IG ready for ballot (and harder still: publication). One area where we've created some overhead for ourselves is the collection of data to populate structured fields in Jira like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/ownd4PbCmKl7H5whV6P9aFy_/image.png\">image.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/ownd4PbCmKl7H5whV6P9aFy_/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/ownd4PbCmKl7H5whV6P9aFy_/image.png\"></a></div><p>i.e., there are detailed fields for every version, artifact, and page in every IG, which must never be removed (one can only add to the list). All of this is backed by XML files in a separate repo from the IG (see <a href=\"https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts/blob/master/xml/FHIR-us-core.xml\">this example for US Core</a>), which means creating pull requests, waiting for an administrator to merge, failed builds, etc.</p>\n<p>My question: how valuable are these fields in Jira? How often do you filter/query off of them, and does this work better than, say, free-text search? I'm trying to understand whether the \"juice is worth the squeeze\" on IG authors, to keep all these detailed fields populated in the Jira plugin/templates that support issue creation.</p>",

I rarely use the other fields to locate an issue I only enter them because I have to.  I always stick the Jira issues warning in the ignore warnings file because it shows up despite me reconciling and pushing it.</p>",

You asked me to start a discussion about how much utility IG authors get from the set of structured data entry fields in Jira; what they're using them for; and whether this value is worth the pain of maintaining and trying to synchronize every piece of content in every version of every IG with an append-only XML file in a distinct repository that the IG authors can't directly commit to.</p>",
