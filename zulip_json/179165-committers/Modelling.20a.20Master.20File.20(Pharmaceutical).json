But Master File has neither, so is DocumentReference right? In fact all the fields of attachment are optional so I could just ignore, but doesn't seem right.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Interesting use-case. I know of a site that uses XDS/XCA (which is FHIR DocumentReference) that simply registers the fact they have documents of various types. Basically indicate they have a Patient resource for each patient they know they have paper documents for.  This step is often called (Record Location Service). When they get a query for documentReferences (actually XDS DocumenEntry), they delay the transaction for as long as the can. They want to delay it up to 3 days. During this time they send a runner (human) to go fetch the box of paper documents. That runner then puts the paper through an automated paper scanner. I am not sure if they update the DocumentReference, or if hey just concatenate all the paper into one PDF file. This works on the USA Sequoia networks (CareQuality and eHEX). Mostly the timeout causes major problems. In FHIR we might recommend use of Subscription to make it asynchronous.  There  is no need to include a location. They might encode for their own purposes their physical location, but it is not exposed to the requesting system.</p>",
