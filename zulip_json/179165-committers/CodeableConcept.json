These concepts may be cross mapped using the &lt;a href=&quot;conceptmap.html&quot;&gt;ConceptMap&lt;/a&gt; resource and/or given as translations directly iuse the &lt;code&gt;Codings&lt;/code&gt; element in the CodeableConcept datatype as shown in the example below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example many qualitative laboratory test results values are typically represented with coded presence/absence concepts. Using the coded value for &#39;negative&#39; with a standard SNOMED CT code translation, &lt;code&gt;valueCodeableConcept&lt;/code&gt; would be:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;json&quot;&gt;\n\n&quot;valueCodeableConcept&quot;: {\n    &quot;coding&quot;: [\n        {\n            &quot;system&quot;: &quot;http://snomed.info/sct&quot;,\n            &quot;code&quot;: &quot;260385009&quot;,\n            &quot;display&quot;: &quot;Negative&quot;\n        }, {\n            &quot;system&quot;: &quot;https://acme.lab/resultcodes&quot;,\n            &quot;code&quot;: &quot;NEG&quot;,\n            &quot;display&quot;: &quot;Negative&quot;\n        }\n    ],\n    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Negative for Chlamydia Trachomatis rRNA&quot;\n}\n\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt; Using Free Text in CodeableConcept:&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When the data element is a  &lt;code&gt;CodeableConcept&lt;/code&gt; type, a plain text representation of the concept is permitted if there is no appropriate code and only free text is available (and not prohibited by the implementation). For example using text only, the &lt;code&gt;Observation.valueCodeableConcept&lt;/code&gt; element would be:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;json&quot;&gt;\n\n&quot;valueCodeableConcept&quot;: {\n    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;uncoded free text result&quot;\n}\n\n        &lt;/pre&gt;\n</pre></div>",
