Unfortunately FHIR does not have  neither \"Sentence\" nor \"Paragraph\" nor \"Annotation\" as Resources and therefore one solution could be to have them as extensions too ... what does the community thinks about it ?</p>",

Each has a valueUnsignedInt.   Using a single range was avoided because it seems that range should indicate bounds for some possible value(s) within those bounds.  The same is done for the start and end indexes of Sentence, Section, Paragraph and simpler tokens.<br>\nAs for resources for those types, a Basic is used with code &gt; coding.  \"system\" is simply \"type-system\", indicating that the ctakes type-system is used, with a \"code\" of the ctakes type.  E.g. \"org.apache.ctakes.typesystem.type.textspan.Segment\"<br>\nIn essence, this is an attempt to utilize existing fhir resources with the realization that different tools may have different ways of expressing bounded types that have similar purpose.  In addition, if the goal of a consumer is to reconstruct a state of the nlp information for some unknown representation, much much more than just section, sentence, paragraph and mention are required and representing with a unique resource is a bit overloading.</p>",
