If the resources are subsequently confirmed or rejected, that will update the tags/status, but not alter the Provenance.</li>\n<li>the range part of the extension should be suitable to be able to show/highlight the parts of the original source that led to the creation of a resource</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please create individual chat topics to further discuss any of the above mentioned issues...</p>",
