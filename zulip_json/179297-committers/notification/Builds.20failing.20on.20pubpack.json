Then the package reads the RSS feeds, and indexes and stores the packages. Then the IG publisher etc use the package server to get all the packages</p>\n<p>that all works well, except for a few packages that I use to distribute resources that are useful to the eco-system, but are not IG packages. hl7.fhir.pubpack is one - it contains all the miscellaineous files to support the web publishing. It's a valid package so far as I can tell, but <a href=\"http://packages.fhir.org\" title=\"http://packages.fhir.org\">packages.fhir.org</a> has so far refused to process it. </p>\n<p>As a result, I am still using the backup package server instead of <a href=\"http://packages.fhir.org\" title=\"http://packages.fhir.org\">packages.fhir.org</a> for those packages. The backup package server runs on <a href=\"http://test.fhir.org\" title=\"http://test.fhir.org\">test.fhir.org</a>, and someone is doing something to that serer that brings it down. I figured out what that is yet, and I don't have time right now. So when that happens, the ci-build fails.</p>",
