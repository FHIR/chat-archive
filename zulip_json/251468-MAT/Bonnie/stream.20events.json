        "content": "<p>Basically, we have 2 proportion measures and we are planning to create a composite measure that combines these two measures to produce a single performance rate and our preferred scoring method is the \"Linear Combinations\".  As outlined in the Blue Print, the \"Linear Combinations\" is one of the Composite Scoring Methods and \"Patient-Level Linear\" is not one of them. However, in the MAT, \"Patient-Level Linear\" is one of the 3 supported composite scoring methods but \"Linear Combinations\" is not listed there.  Are \"Linear Combinations\" and \"Patient-Level Linear\" scoring methods the same?  Your response is appreciated.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nTien Thai</p>",
