        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"249396\">@Tien Thai</span> , that error is saying that your Measure Observation function takes an argument that isn't consistent with the type of elements in the Measure Population. So if your population is made up of <code>\"Encounter, Performed\"</code>, then your Measure Observation function needs to take an argument of type <code>\"Encounter, Performed\"</code>. Does that help?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191359\">@Bryn Rhodes</span> ,<br>\nThank you very much for your quick response.  I have managed to resolve that error with your suggestion.  However,  given what have been defined in the THATKACommon library and I am attempting to implement one of the suggested recommendations (i.e. switch to continuous variable measure on line 176), the MAT showed errors when saving groups (see attached screenshot).   Can you please provide me a suggestion to resolve those errors?  Thank you very much for your help.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nTien Thai</p>\n<p>PS:<br>\nThe measure I am building in the MAT is called \"VTE-Bleeding Measure 02\" and the recommendations are from the link below:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/cqframework/CQL-Formatting-and-Usage-Wiki/blob/master/Source/Cooking%20With%20CQL/47/146_CompositeMeasures.cql\">https://github.com/cqframework/CQL-Formatting-and-Usage-Wiki/blob/master/Source/Cooking%20With%20CQL/47/146_CompositeMeasures.cql</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/e9Er4Cm70k-xFXgKmDx6-Ggj/Error.JPG\">Error.JPG</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/e9Er4Cm70k-xFXgKmDx6-Ggj/Error.JPG\" title=\"Error.JPG\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/e9Er4Cm70k-xFXgKmDx6-Ggj/Error.JPG\"></a></div>",
