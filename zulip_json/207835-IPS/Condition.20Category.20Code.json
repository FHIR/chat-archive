        "content": "<p>That's actually a quite interesting question, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191364\">@Peter Jordan</span> - in a few respects.  The basic idea for that decision I think was twofold.  First, wherever and whenever possible we were attempting to specify recognized standard terminology, and at the time that we made the decision the base resource binding to the condition-category value set was only an example, with those codes appearing to be rather ad hoc and with no particular requirement or expectation for their use.  And second, the reason that we chose to use a single LOINC code for \"Problem\" in the value set, but with an extensible binding to also allow other options if needed, was that this was for use in the IPS Problems Section and we felt there was not a good reason generally for items that were not considered to be a clinical <strong>problem</strong> to be included in the Problems section of a patient summary (restating that the IPS is not intended to be and will not necessarily represent the entire EHR).</p>\n<p>But now comes the interesting wrinkle in this.  As I said, the binding of Condition.category to the condition-category value set was example, and that was the case for the first 4 publications of R4 through 3.5a.0.  But then in the final R4 release the binding was changed to <strong>extensible</strong> - and, even though I attend the Patient Care WG calls nearly every week, I don't recall having heard any discussion about that and somehow I completely missed that change until right now.  And the upshot that I see of  it is that with the binding now being <strong>extensible</strong>, the published IPS specification is technically non-conformant in this with the FHIR R4 release.  That might mean that we need to add this to the IPS technical correction that we are working toward.  But I also wonder if the change from an example to an extensible binding for a <strong>category</strong> element in the base standard was either intended by PCWG or is even technically correct? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191403\">@Michelle (Moseman) Miller</span>?  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191415\">@Giorgio Cangioli</span> may have some further thoughts on all of this. And  I guess we'll have to see how it further plays out.</p>",

Do you have a link to the WGM minutes that you can post?  This decision turns out to be problematic for IPS (which is sponsored by PCWG - although I think it may still have been sponsored by SDWG at that time), and I wonder if it doesn't also cause other issues?  I also note some weirdness in the issue description, as it's about Condition.clinicalStatus but then it says that \"It would mean that this <strong>allergyIntolerance</strong> cannot be communicated if the current status is unknown\".</p>",

It isn't strictly necessary to do it for Condition.severity, as using the LOINC code alone is still conformant and the validation output for that is an Information message (not a Warning).  For Condition.category the message is a Warning, and technically the instance is non-conformant without the additional condition-category <code>problem-list-item</code> code.  So we need to add the <code>problem-list-item</code> code to our Condition profile and examples in the upcoming IPS technical correction (for the current R4-based IG).  I'm not sure if we will want to add the SNOMED CT severity codes in the technical correction, as we intentionally did not use the SNOMED CT codes and instead chose LOINC (as it is universally available) - but we could discuss that.  And yes, adding the additional codes in both cases does make the Validator happy and removes the warning and information messages.</p>",
