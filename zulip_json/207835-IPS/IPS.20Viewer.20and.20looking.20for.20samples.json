Here's the link to it online: <a href=\"http://www.ipsviewer.com/\">http://www.ipsviewer.com/</a> (please use for test samples only). Right now I've only checked out 2 sample IPS bundles in the tool, and there's certainly more work to do. If you can share links to a few more IPS samples in this thread, that would be greatly appreciated!</p>",

The viewer was expecting a custodian, which is why it errored earlier. In addition, there was another thing I debugged on the display of ingredient information. I've added them to the repo, but please try them out and let me know what you think. I've also got a sample now from <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191427\">@Jens Villadsen</span> which I'll try to see if that's working next.</p>",

Right now, it looks like the immunizations section (11369-6) of your sample has references to 3 resources. The first is an Immunization Resource (urn:uuid:c220e36c-eb67-4fc4-9ba1-2fabc52acec4) which works fine for display. The second is a  ImmunizationRecommendation (urn:uuid:15d9e5d7-4c89-4e63-a523-efc4c442acfd) which isn't displaying. The third is a DocumentReference (urn:uuid:25f477da-8281-4201-b98b-3b142eb6c721) to a serialized QR code which isn't displaying. Should the second and third resources be included in the immunizations section? I will try to create an alert but right now the tool won't display immunization section with references to non immunization resources.</p>",
