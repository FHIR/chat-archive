I presume this is not the STU1 version - is that available somewhere or are there plans to publish it?</p>",

I was already on that page but did not realize that one can actually download the package from there <span aria-label=\"face palm\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f926\" role=\"img\" title=\"face palm\">:face_palm:</span> However, it seems that Forge  can only (easily) set IPS as a dependency if the package it available on Simplifier (which I suspect is automatic if it it goes in the package registry) - currently, that also only has v0.3.  Would it be possible to also make the STU1 package available via the registry?</p>",
