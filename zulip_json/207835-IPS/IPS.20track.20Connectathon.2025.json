The IPS Track proposal is <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2020-09+International+Patient+Summary+Track\">here</a>.  Apologies for the short notice, but we plan to have a track orientation session during the IPS call <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/concalls/CallDetails.aspx?concall=49586\">today</a> at 11:00 AM Eastern / 15:00 UTC (Zoom <a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/j/5328571160\">meeting</a>).  We're looking forward to meeting up and making progress with IPS on the call and the Connectathon over these next few days!</p>",

This is a little earlier than the official start time, but it will be a bit better to get started early for those who participating from Europe and it may help avoid some conflicts with other tracks (apologies to US west coast folks!).   We look forward to getting together tomorrow at 8:00 AM - and we'll further plan and coordinate our expected activities over the next 2 days.</p>",

The orientation was rather informal, but it may be useful, and I'll definitely get an accessible copy uploaded (I had trouble with the downloaded version before, but I should be able to solve that).  I'll post in the chat again when the link is fixed.  And we'll be meeting at 8:00 AM Eastern tomorrow and do further planning, as we noted above.</p>",
