At least some of this (like \"illegal use of resolve() in discriminator\" ) appears to be related to the Inferno community version having an outdated version of the IPS spec.  We are migrating Inferno very soon to the new \"framework\" based version (currently at <a href=\"https://inferno-dev.healthit.gov/\">inferno-dev</a>), and we plan to make all future updates in the new version.  You <strong>may</strong> get better validation results if you try using that now, as the IPS tests there are using a more recent (but not yet the very latest) version of the spec - and either way we would appreciate further feedback on how that works for you.  I am also getting close to finishing and pushing some significant updates to the IPS spec, mostly for cleaning up the validation of the IPS bundle and profiles.  Once that is available I think that should resolve most of your issues, and I will be updating the Inferno IPS test kit with the new version of the IPS spec as soon as possible after it's in the CI build.</p>",

Generally the guidance has been to not rely on having meta.profile populated, so we have not been including it in our examples.  By not including it, then at least we're not setting an example and implying (even erroneously) that it <strong>should</strong> be populated.  We can discuss it further, though.</p>",

It doesn't return any errors, so great work! It did return a series of warnings, which I fixed and posted out to this location: <a href=\"https://github.com/jddamore/IPSviewer/blob/main/samples/validated_samples/AT_ELGA_GmbH_01.json\">https://github.com/jddamore/IPSviewer/blob/main/samples/validated_samples/AT_ELGA_GmbH_01.json</a></p>\n<p>In terms of the warning fixes, they fell into a few groups: <br>\n1) Changing Patient.identifier.type to SB from SS. That may or may not be appropriate for production, but this valueSet is the desired one: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-identifier-type.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-identifier-type.html</a><br>\n2) Editing the display of the LOINC codes. Several were shorthand displays which clinicians would get and I just changed to match a near display from LOINC. There was one you might want to check out: LOINC 3209-4 (<a href=\"https://loinc.org/3209-4/\">https://loinc.org/3209-4/</a>). You had this listed as Factor VII which is different from the code, which is factor VIII<br>\n3) Editing to the LL and HH interpretation displays<br>\n4) Adding another category for the Condition resources<br>\n5) Removing the display from the Immunization resources SNOMED codes (since not matching English display from code)</p>\n<p>Part of my work is with the Global Digital Health Partnership and we're having a mini-connectathon tomorrow (6:30-10:30 US ET). Since Austria is part of the GDHP, let me know if you'd have any interest to participate (Participation needs to be cleared, but I can ask).
