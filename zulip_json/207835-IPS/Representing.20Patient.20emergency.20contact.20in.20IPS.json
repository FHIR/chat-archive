For R4 in general, there is a standard way to do this (see <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/How.20to.20represent.20patient.20emergency.20number.20in.20FHIR.3F\">this thread</a>): add a <code>contact</code> and set <code>contact.relationship.coding.code</code> equal to \"C\" in <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0131\">http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0131</a> (part of the extensibly bound ValueSet).</p>\n<p>However, the IPS patient profile explicitly overwrites the extensible binding in the base spec with a required binding on <code>contact.relationship</code> to the value set <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/ValueSet/personal-relationship-uv-ips\">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/ValueSet/personal-relationship-uv-ips</a>. This, in turn, only contains terms designating family/social relations (roommate, mother etc.), but no code for emergency contact. Is there another way to represent an emergency contact? - it seems an important concept to capture (certainly is for us).</p>",
