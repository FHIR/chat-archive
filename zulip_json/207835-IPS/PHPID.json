        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194174\">@Paul Denning</span> The simple answer is that we've (purposefully) left the slicing open, so you are able to use whatever code systems and codes that you need to in vaccineCode - including PHPID.  But the somewhat more complex answer is that if we are going to use PHPID in IPS then we should plan to provide some support for it (if and when that is practical).  We had included the PHPID and other IDMP levels originally, but removed them (other than the text which remains in the Immunization.vaccineCode definition) because at that time there wasn't any actual IDMP content available for use.  But, since that seems to be starting to happen now, at least in this case, it may be time to bring something like that back.  It would need a code system (likely represented in a CodeSystem resource, even if the actual content available is only a fragment) and the associated value set(s), and ideally terminology server support for it, at least in <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a>.  As long as we have a source for the actual content, that all should be doable.</p>",
