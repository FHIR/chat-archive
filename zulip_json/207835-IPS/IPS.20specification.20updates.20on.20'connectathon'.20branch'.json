There are still some updates that need to be made, but the content is beginning to be relatively stable and will serve as the basis for much or most of what we intend to test during the Connectathon, which is coming up now in just under two weeks.  Please ask questions or make any suggestions, and feel free to submit a pull request if there is something that you see that needs to be changed (I'm sure there are plenty of possibilities for that!).  We will use the results of the Connectathon testing to determine the final updates that we need to make for publishing the StU update (or if we believe the changes that we have made are significant enough and need further input, we might consider going for another ballot round prior to publishing an updated version).</p>",

After the IPS call today I've actually discovered another potential opportunity to allow us to make somewhat less \"radical\" changes to the currently published spec.  So if that pans out reasonably well later today, we may have two 'connectathon' branches (e.g., 'connectathon-2') that we can test.  I'm not sure if that's actually good or bad - but we can see.</p>",

We were using the branches to test some different strategies for updating before committing to a particular one, but I think we seem to be settled sufficiently on that to move ahead.  The other practical consideration is that I need to create proper Jira issues for all of the updates (I think 67 commits beyond master at the moment).  That should shrink a fair bit once I do a rebase, though, as at least the multitudinous txcache updates will be able to be rolled into one.  There will still be a good number of trackers to create, but hopefully it's manageable.  I'll try it out on a test branch first and see if it's feasible to do today.</p>",
