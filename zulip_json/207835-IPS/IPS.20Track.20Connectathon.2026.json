I hope we're all looking forward to the next two days and what we can accomplish for advancing the specification and implementations of the International Patient Summary (IPS).  We can use this topic for our general track-related communications.  And we can create separate specific Zulip topics as we need to for any particular issues where that will be useful.  We had great attendance at the track kickoff call today.  During the kickoff call it was suggested to move the Inferno session to 10:00 AM PST (rather than 9:00).  I've updated that on the track Confluence <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97464635\">page</a> and am letting the organizers know so that they can update Whova with that for tomorrow.  I will be sending out proposed times for the additional track breakout sessions, so you can be looking for that.  Looking forward to connecting up tomorrow!</p>",
