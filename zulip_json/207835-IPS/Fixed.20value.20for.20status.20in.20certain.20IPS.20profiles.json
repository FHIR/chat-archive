Looking through the IPS profiles, I see that the some of the  profiles for the <em>Diagnostic results</em> section  fix the <code>status</code> to be  \"final\"/\"completed\" (the corresponding profiles on Observation and Media). Other profileS used in this section (e.g. on Specimen or ImagingStudy)  or in other sectionS (e.g.on  Immunization, ImagingStudy, MedicationStatement or Observation) do <em>not</em> constrain the <code>status</code> field. What is the reasoning behind these differences? Having looked at the fixed-status profiles first, I initially thought fixing the status was a general principle reflecting the idea that a Patient Summary should only contain \"finished &amp; known good\" data , and no data that is unfinished, known to be incorrect etc. But that theory clearly does not hold up.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks for the reference! - was an interesting read.  One key distinction I took away was that between the status of the data capture (a specific observation made at one particular point in time) vs. the status of what is being captured.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Status of the condition and related times</strong><br>\nEach Observation contained by a Concern Act is a discrete observation of a condition. Its statusCode is always “completed” since it is the “status of the activity of observing, not the status of what is being observed”. <br>\nAnother aspect that became clearer to me on further research is that possible values for <code>status</code> differ significantly between resources. Thus, for MedicationStatement I understand you would want to be able to indicate both that the medicine is being taken (\"active\") or that it has been taken but no longer is (\"completed\").</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having said that, I  wouldn't say I can now completely understand the fix/non-fix choices in IPS (say, why <code>Specimen.status</code> is not fixed to \"available\").   I don't feel competent to say if this is something that should be changed in the profiles. However, I do think it would be very helpful to have a discussion of this in the IG, clarifying (1) what principles/distinctions are used when fixing <code>status</code> values, and (2) what expectations  (if any) there are for the status of the data put into the IPS, where not fixed - e.g. is non-final (or equivalent) expected to be an exception and, if so, for which cases?</p>",
