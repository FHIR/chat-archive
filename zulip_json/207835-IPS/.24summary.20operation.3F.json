The patient is either</p>\n<ul>\n<li>explicitly identified by the id of the patient resource</li>\n<li>implicitly identified as the only patient in scope due to security/context</li>\n<li>specified by other additional (unspecified here) parameters (or do we specify the identifier parameter?)<br>\nThis operation returns a bundle (type = document) for single patient.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IPS would recommend that smart-app-launch is used to acquire the security tokens for the operation, but that's not part of the definition of the operation</p>\n<p>The operation asks for the latest appropriate summary, whether that already exists, or must be newly generated. Unless otherwise specified, the server has discretion to choose how to fulfill the request. We anticipate that there will be a profusion of business practices around currency/attestation, and therefore variance in parameters around that. If some consistency emerges, HL7 would consider adding additional parameters to the base definition</p>\n<p>IPS will define a profile on Bundle with the URL in the example above, so that an IPS can be requested. In the absence of a profile parameter, server has discretion to construct/return a summary of its choice</p>\n</blockquote>",
