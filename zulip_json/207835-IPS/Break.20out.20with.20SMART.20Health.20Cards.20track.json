Goal would be to review the SHC FHIR IG profiles for patient, immunizations and lab tests (observations) in comparison to the IPS profiles.

It looks like that time is going to be difficult for me personally.  My meeting with ONC that was supposed to happen yesterday has been moved to 3:30 today.  And I have a personal item to accompany my mother at an appointment at 4:30.  With the other IPS sessions this afternoon I do have 30 min. available at 3:00 PM EDT, and also 30 min. at 1:30 EDT, but that looks like about it for me.  Not sure how it is for the rest of the group.  Maybe we do it at 3:00 PM EDT, if that works for you, and then I can drop (or multitask) after the first 30 minutes?</p>",
