We didn't have sufficient time on the call today to address the details, but want to continue the discussion here in preparation for further discussion and hopefully agreeing on a proposed resolution on the IPS call next week.  Some of the considerations might be: (1) whether the GPS (Global Patient Set) is represented and hosted in FHIR and the IPS IG as a value set from the full International Edition (for use in SNOMED member countries) or as a code system fragment and corresponding value set (for use in SNOMED non-member countries), or both; (2) whether to use and identify content in IPS from the full GPS wherever it may appear in any of the IPS value set bindings (most likely with separate slices?) or to restrict the use to only the content from the IPS free set (and its individual contributing IPS value sets); and (3) how to handle and describe the use of SNOMED CT (from the GPS and otherwise) in IPS in both SNOMED member and non-member countries, so that the use is understood and maintained within the respective license restrictions.</p>",

(And possibly from other pools, which adds another two classes:  GPS mixed with other non-GPS SNOMED concepts, and \"pure GPS\" but with other  non-SNOMED concepts added)</p>",

Looking at it again, #2 probably isn't a real or relevant choice, as presumably any current IPS value sets that are subsets of the GPS content can remain as they are, and anywhere that the GPS intersects the content of a current IPS value set then there wouldn't be any reason to further limit what is being made available from the GPS.   Hopefully that made some sense - but I think it means that we can remove #2 from any further consideration.</p>",
