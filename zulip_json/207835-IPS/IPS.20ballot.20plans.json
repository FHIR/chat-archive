If other considerations are brought forward that certainly might alter that very rough estimate.</p>",

The changes that have need made since then have been based on the feedback from IPS testing and the various IPS implementation efforts and the additional issues identified from that.  We've discussed the strategy on this quite a bit and have vetted our available options (with the GOM, etc.), and it turns out that how to manage this falls into somewhat of a grey zone, with two acceptable options that can be taken.  We could (1) either take the changes made subsequent to our initial STU 1 publication back to ballot now, or (2) we could incorporate and publish the changes in an STU update and then go back to ballot at a later time (likely when we update the IPS IG for FHIR R5).  Where we've landed in that discussion is to take the #2 approach and move to an updated publication first.  That may not necessarily be the \"traditional\" approach, but in this case we have (so far) agreed that it will be the best way forward for the IPS community and our current and anticipated IPS implementation efforts.  Does that make sense?<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197638\">@John D'Amore</span>, any additional comments?</p>",

The changes to Must Support are one of the current open issue so I think the feedback that has been provided in the past week in IPS Stream will be helpful for that.</p>",
