        "content": "<p>Hello,<br>\nthe IPS Implementation Guide standardizes the structure of the Patient Summary using FHIR resources. The Patient Summary is represented with an instance of Composition referring to all other FHIR resources needed to describe other specific aspects of PS. For this reason, the whole PS (Composition + related resources) in FHIR is contained within an instance of Bundle whose first entry is a Composition. <br>\nSo, my question is: what is the right query to retrieve an instance of IPS,? At the moment I have only these two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>query Composition resource in this way: <em>Composition?type=http://loinc.org|60591-5&amp;subject=&lt;ID&gt;&amp;_include=</em>&amp;_count=1*</li>\n<li>query Bundle resource in this way: <em>Bundle?type=document&amp;composition=&lt;ref to Composition representing IPS&gt;</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>With the first option, the bundle is automatically created by the responding server (and this bundle will be the standard FHIR one not compliant to IPS specs), while with the second option the Bundle must have been previously saved to the server (respecting IPS specs) as a Bundle of type Document. <br>\nI suppose that option number 2 is the right way to ask for a PS, but I'm a little worried about the fact that the search parameter \"composition\" is tagged as TU (Trial Use) so it' far away from being a standard search attribute.</p>\n<p>Cheers and thanks<br>\nAlessio</p>",

I mean: if the act of the clinician must produce also a digital signature we should assume that in that country the Composition exists only as part of a signed Bundle containing it.

It should be not the client, but the country that exposes the NCP, to decide if the Bundle is generated automatically from a composition or is created and stored manually by a clinician.  </p>\n<p>The standard API could allow to retrieve also single parts of the Patient Summary, including the entire composition, but it should be agreed that the composition is not (always) the complete official Patient Summary.
