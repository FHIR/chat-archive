If not, could you copy-paste the differential and then delete the MustSupports you don't need?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is what we've done on the Canadian IPS variant--the actual IPS MS flags are too restrictive, so rather than derived profile of IPS, we've developed parallel profiles that let you conform to IPS but don't require it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
