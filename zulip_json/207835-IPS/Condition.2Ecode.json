I basically agree with what <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191506\">@Yunwei Wang</span> said - except that I think it would be better to describe it as \"the slices are functionally equivalent to\" (rather than \"this slice is the same as\").  So it would read as \"My understanding is that the slices are functionally equivalent to an extensible binding on a combined valueset of the two value sets in the slices.\"</p>\n<p>And I think this is pointing out further that presentation of this using slicing isn't really as clear as I have been imagining it to be.

While relaxing the bindings where \"required\" breaks FHIR compliance, Is is possible to add additional slices where needed? </p>\n<p>I realize that adding extra slices may not break FHIR compliance, in certain cases additional critical data may be part of these slices and may be ignored if receiving systems require a pure IPS.</p>",
