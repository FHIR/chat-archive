We had some recent discussion about whether to revisit that - but I <strong>think</strong> that we decided to keep it constrained out as it is now.  The cmp-2 invariant comes from the base Composition resource, not the IPS Composition profile - and in this case emptyReason.empty() always will be true, so the invariant is satisfied.  I assume that you are seeing the same thing?</p>",
