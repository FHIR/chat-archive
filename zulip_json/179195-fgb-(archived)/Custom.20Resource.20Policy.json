Before FGB gives approval, we wanted to be sure FGB members had a chance to provide input. Given the challenge of Canadian holiday for today’s call and US holiday for next week’s call, we proposed moving the discussion to email. The policy was discussed on today’s FGB call and there was support to adopt the policy among those on the call.</p>\n<p>Action: Please review the policy and ask questions via email or <a href=\"http://chat.fhir.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://chat.fhir.org\">chat.fhir.org</a> in the FGB stream.</p>\n<p>When input is collected and answers are provided, the proposal is that we have a round of email motion/second/discussion/vote so we can close out the policy recommendation given all the two overlapping Monday holidays.</p>",
