Seen the restriction on cardinality on PI and PPN slices, is there any advice how to include all identifiers?<br>\nThanks</p>",

Indeed, good practices encourage to do not be too restrictive with cardinality and you picked up exactly the reason of why these good practices are good practices :)</p>",
