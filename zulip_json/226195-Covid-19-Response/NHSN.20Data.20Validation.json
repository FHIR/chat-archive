Turns out, it was the ICU capacity tracking data, and is basically the perfect SANER dataset.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/OCYMOY-Nr7ViM_SOmZW3vfSR/Symptomatic-SANER-NHSN-HistoricalData-MeasureScores.png\">Symptomatic-SANER-NHSN-HistoricalData-MeasureScores.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/OCYMOY-Nr7ViM_SOmZW3vfSR/Symptomatic-SANER-NHSN-HistoricalData-MeasureScores.png\" title=\"Symptomatic-SANER-NHSN-HistoricalData-MeasureScores.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/OCYMOY-Nr7ViM_SOmZW3vfSR/Symptomatic-SANER-NHSN-HistoricalData-MeasureScores.png\"></a></div><p>The data import, geocoding, and mapping barely took a single day.
