For those that are a centralized offsite lab for a health system, they would have their own CLIA number and based upon the patient location (inpatient hospital A, inpt Hospital B, outpt at clinic C, employee health), it could be used to \"filter\" reporting to what a particular hospital's numbers.  </p>\n<p>Not sure if folks have seen my Scenarios for patients from last week?

If labs are decentralized across a hospital (i.e. blood bank near surgical suite or ED), main lab on 1st floor or basement, cancer center lab near the cancer clinic, etc., they may have the same or different CLIA numbers.  In other words, may not be a 1:1 match to the hospital.  Also in some health systems with multiple hospital sites, they may have a stat lab at each hospital, but used a central shared lab offsite for routine and esoteric testing.   There are many different combinations possible.</p>",
