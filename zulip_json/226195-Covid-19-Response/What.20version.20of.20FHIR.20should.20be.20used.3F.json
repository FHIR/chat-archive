Unlike open-source or even for-profit software, standards require balloting (voting) and consensus building, rather than just the latest publication of a library.  </p>\n<p>So, the R5 Preview isn't exactly the development branch or pre-release that you might be accustomed to.  Rather, that's where the report-out from after the connectathon lands.  It's downstream in the standards development process, and what we are feeding into; not what people should be using during the connectathon itself.  </p>\n<p>Keep in mind that a lot of the FHIR servers in production at hospitals are still on DSTU2 in the United States, and on STU3 in Europe.   For those production systems, the R4 release _is_ the latest version that they're trying to move towards.  So stick with R4.  The R5 Preview should be considered alpha/experimental, rather than beta/testing ready.</p>",
