It also doesn't clarify if the hospital is sending their specimens to their state public health labs, if these would be in the counts (assume not, since not performed by the hospital lab).  </p>\n<p>Are those of you working on reporting planning on getting these data directly from the hospital's laboratory information system (LIS)?  If feeds are from the EHR, it might miss tests performed for the ambulatory providers and those sent out to other laboratories if the hospital isn't performing testing in house/onsite, such as those performed by public health or independent labs.   Not sure if CLIA required Specimen Rejection Reason is also available in the hospital EHR for community providers (say those not part of health system and have their own EHR interfaced to the lab's LIS) which order/result from a performing hospital laboratory bypassing that hospital lab's EHR system.</p>",
