Yeah, this is all easy web stuff, but finding the right person in IT who UNDERSTANDS THAT for an organization that large isn't.  Been there, done that.  It took a team of 5 many years to get that fixed at a former employer.</p>\n<p>At the present time, the \"URL\" for HSLOC can at best be represented by an OID, even though CDC staff and contractors did everything they thought they needed to in order to create an appropriate URL.  It meets the general goals of FHIR, and this seems to me to be a case of perfection being the enemy of the good.  At this point, both HL7 AND VSAC have published TWO DIFFERENT FHIR URLS for this vocabulary, and NEITHER of them is the publisher of it, nor comes anywhere close to the publisher's intent.  That situation is even worse.</p>",
