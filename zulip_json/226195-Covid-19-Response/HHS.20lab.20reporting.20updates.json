For non hospital labs (those excluded from MU incentives and requirements), and testing/collection locations such as drive up/through testing locations, more might be needed such as upgrading to 2015 certified versions of information systems as recommended or using standards such as LOINC and SNOMED CT and HL7 v 2.51.  It should help nudge labs to the same level of standards adoption so more results can be computer actionable.</p>",
