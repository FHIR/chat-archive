Do you have an updated sample query and maybe guidance on what search parameters are required?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do you have a general recommendation on a best approach for pulling as big a chunk of MeasureReport records as possible?</p>\n</li>\n<li>In order to show MeasureReports on a map, we also pull Organizations and link them with MeasureReports. Does your server have Organization data we can query, as well?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks in advance!<br>\n--Mark</p>",
