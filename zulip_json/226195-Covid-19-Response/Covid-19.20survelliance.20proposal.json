Most COVID-19 testing is PCR based currently, but Serology testing and those advertised as point of care testing (POCT) are emerging into market.  Also heard a patient collected specimen option (Let's call these consumer testing) is also coming to market soon.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For US COVID-19 testing, FDA needs to approve for use in US.  As of earlier this week, ALL US testing is considered moderate to high complexity (including those listed as POCT, like Abbott ID Now.)  Regulatory requires all mod-high complexity testing to be performed by a trained laboratory professional.   Therefore, there is no Drive up testing, but there is Drive up specimen collection (with a valid physician order/requesition).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once test is laboratory validated (by each lab offering), it is listed in the lab's CLIA Specimen Collection Manual, along with allowed specimens, Ask at Order Entry (AOE) questions (i.e. information needed by the laboratory to initiate testing which is not covered in demographics, other fields such as which specimen has been collected? ), specimen containers or swabs used for collection, transport info, etc. and other regulatory required info, including specimen rejection criteria, minimum volumes, etc.  If required info not provided or improper specimen collection, the specimen may be rejected (lab must provide a reason which is in HL7 v2.51 spm 21 field) and test may not be performed (per lab discretion).  CLIA Specimen Collection Manual is required to be at all places orders are placed/specimens are collected.  </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Think of this as the lab's menu/test catalog/lab comendium of what can be ordered.  Can't order a taco from McDonald's (as they don't have supplies, not validated test, etc.).  Most labs have online catalog, but there is not widespread adoption of a test menu HL7 standards, either Electronic Directory of Service (eDOS, V2.51 format), or Service Catalog (FHIR).  Such electronic formats woudl ideally be served up to all CPOE locations where orders are placed (usually EHR) as orders require a physician (or advanced provider) to place in most all countries.  This is known as the order requisition.  </p>\n<p>So far we have Test catalog (orders) -&gt;  EHR/CPOE systems..... from interoperability perspective.</p>\n<p>cont...</p>",

        "content": "<p>cont....</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Each laboratory builds/models the test info in their LIS for ordering and resulting as several major data items:  Test Order, Test Result (i.e observation),  and Test Result Value (i.e. numeric, Qualitative), which may or may not vary dependign on type of specimen analyzed.  Often, the Ask at Order Entry (AOE) questions and responses are built in the LIS as Test Result items and reponses/values.  All these data are the Source of Truth (SOT) for laboratory data.  This is the basic lab data infrastructure/modeling used most everywhere, since the 1960's when lab data was first digitized.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lab professionals when they set up and validate tests according to regulatory also need to follow the manufacturer's insert as to allowed units, result values, etc., which also influences test build.  Each lab is to distinguish tests on their menu.  Each usually comes up with it's own version of naming a test.  Often these laboratory naming conventions are not seen in EHR builds as most all US EHRs come up with their own generic way of naming a test as they may be interfaced/offer 1-5 test catalogs for physician ordering (often based on patient insurance), but also which laboratories a physician practice/hospital is contracted with/interfaced to in providing lab testing.  </p>\n<p>These generic Order name builds, are usually in EHR dictionary which populates CPOE (clinical provider order entry) that a provider uses on a patient instance level when they decide to order a test.  In the US, electronic ordering /CPOE has been required for Meaningful Use (MU) so most all Eligible Providers (EP) and Elgible Hospitals (EH) should be creating electronic orders.  They still might print them off and include paper requisitions with the specimen in some cases as HL7 Lab Orders Interfacing (LOI) Guide wasn't required in MU 3.  Interfaces are established between most EHRs and LISs, but may not exist in others.  </p>\n<p>It would greatly help with interoperability if both eDOS/Order Catalog were required and then the orders therein and AOEs were sent across interfaces to the performing laboratory.  The quickest way is to utilize the HL7 2.51 interfaces as many have 2.31 or 2.51 already in use and clinically validated (interface checks between EHR and LIS and EHR for orders and results is also an accreditation requirement for some lab accrediting bodies in US).  FHIR functionality isn't  part of routine order and results interfacing/serving in any LISs that Hans and I are aware, even though a number of vendors that have LISs are active FHIR developers/connectathon participants (although all would be welcome to test service catalog, orders, results, etc).  It will likely take 10 or more years for lab community and regulations to catch up to support FHIR. HL7 V2.51 is fairly widespread in lab community.  However, there are still a number of laboratories that may still use paper, fax, flatfile and other means to transmit orders and results.  That is because only hospital labs were part of MU requirements.  So the largest lab segment physician office labs (POLs), goverment/DOD (have their own regs), blood banks, independent labs, etc Do NOT have to use MU standards (HL7 messaging, LOINC, SCT) as there is no requirement!!  Several large reference labs like LabCorp and Quest are adopting voluntarily (which is wonderful!!)  Sadly, a number of independent labs have not adopted.  Need to get ALL labs on the same standards for interoperability.</p>\n<p>So now we have  Performing lab Test catalog (idealy future use of eDOS/Service Catalog)-&gt;&gt; receipt by EHR and then used for CPOE order catalog in EHR---&gt;&gt; Used to generate on patient instance level a LOI message (v 2.51 format/future FHIR service request needs to be tested with all types of orders) sent from EHR to--&gt;&gt;  receipt in performing Lab LIS.  </p>\n<p>Often EHR orders aren't same name convention but more generic to meet provider needs.  Provider wants a burger, but lab A has BIg Mac #3 meal and Lab B has Whopper/#2 value meal.  EHR name is mapped to #2  or 3 and sent across interface.  Performing lab knows by order # which test is desired on their menu.  Ideally same test naming conventions will be used and not changed.  Most of end to end order and resulting is seen as point to point interfaces.  Most US EHRs are unable to handle dynamic test catalog updates from performing lab when a new lab like COVID-19 is on the menu.  A manual build by each hospital/provider EHR is needed.  Unfortunately in the US, we don't have a single test menu of test names like in Australia and some other countries by which orders and results are named/encoded for use in information systems.</p>\n<p>This is the order process.  In the catalog and LIS builds, the order is tied to a separate result component (result #).  If the same test result (with numeric units, or qual result values) is used across several prder panels (panel being anytime more than one result is reported), the result component is part of one or more panels.  Take a Hemoglobin.  It can be ordered soly, as hemoglobin order and hemoglobin result or it can be part of a panel order Hemoglobin and Hematocrit (H&amp;H)), Compelete Blood Count (CBC), etc.  Similar to how a hamburger patty can be part of a hamburger, cheeseburger, big mac, etc.  Depends on which one ordered.  These result items may be build once in the LIS.  Often the same test is performed on same instrument on same specimen.  </p>\n<p>For COVID-19 testing , some PCR tests are a single item and single result on a specific specimen type.  In other instances, the COVID-19 test is really a panel order with 1 or many result components reported back to the ordering provider (along with any AOE results and result values).  </p>\n<p>cont... later....</p>",

Data sharing from an IVD platform is typically done via interface between the instrument and LIS within the laboratory (see IHE Lab Automation Workflow or LAW Profile or older ASTM interface standards).  The data items they list would need to be provided to the performing laboratory, for the laboratory to share them with public health.  These data are not typically shared with the laboratory.

Some major reference labs have reported receiving paper requisitions lacking patient contact information with COVID-19 orders.  If pos, public health contact tracing and contacting the patient are delayed which may lead to spread of the virus or patient care/safety issues.

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> <br>\n-right. One thing to keep in mind (which you are probably aware), is although \"faster\" testing is available, say like the Abbott ID Now, which can be placed in a variety of testing areas, doesn't mean it is appropriate for all testing situations.  Looks like it processes only a single patient specimen at a time and thus could have throughput of 4-6 an hour.  In 4 hours, only 24 or so patients would be tested, while the pcr methods might lend themselves to several hundred results in a 4 hour period if I recall correctly.  Although it takes a bit longer, more patients can be tested at time, resulting in a higher throughput/testing rate, which may be most desirable.  POC Testing may be find for low volume testing.</p>\n<p>-Not 100% convinced AOE data collection is 100% on the lab side.  Suspect a number of items are supposed to be sent to the lab, but it's the specimen collection/ordering person who may not be providing, such as the drive up demographics.  Also although a test is POCT, often it's performed under a laboratory's CLIA certificate and thus results are entered into the LIS as though they were performed in lab and then resulted to the EHR.  Which means, data are in V2.</p>\n<p>-regarding panels, looks like one panel LOINC is for IgG and IgM serologies, so suspect one result for each.  Another is for PCR</p>\n<p>-ELR is on the results reporting side, so eDOS has capabilities listing AOEs required for a test order, whereas LOI would be where the ordering provider provides the info in the order sent to the lab.  ELR would include AOEs as result items and their respective values, as would LRI.  For example for a wound culture, an AOE may be \"Specimen Source\", which would required the person collecting the specimen to indicate where on the body the site was swabbed (right leg, left eye, etc.) .  AOE received in the lab then can populate the lab result \"Specimen Source\" with a response of \"right leg\".  Given certain organisms such as MRSA aren't reportable unless they are from a sterile site, it's critical that the lab know if a specimen is from a sterile site or not.  A skin (non sterile site) may only be reported back to ordering provider, but MRSA inside the body from a sterile site would be reportable using ELR, and also to provider with LRI.  See the combined eDOS, LOI, LRI, ELR HL7 v2.51 guide for further details</p>\n<p>-AOE.  Yes, I'd expect most AOEs to be 1 question: 1 response.  Although if a question is address, it may contain several elements (street, city, etc).  Totally concur on consistent format</p>\n<p>-Regarding symptom, severity and onset date...  a few factors here.  Usually it's not the lab collecting or reporting this info.  I think it is best suited for the provider to note and likely to report in eCR.  As there are many websites and apps that now ask patients about symptoms and onset, to determine if they should get COVID-19 testing, one way to collect the data is develop an app that coudl be used on the consumer facing side for patients to self report to their providers, such as Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) or patient reported info.  This info could feed into a provider system, that could be incorporated into eCR or other reportig mechanism to get that info to public health, especially if these patients are ambulatory and aren't tested.  Might provide folks a better idea of the true infection rate as I've heard it may be at least 10 xs higher than pos case rate in a region.</p>\n<p>-agree certain things in the paper may not be achievable exactly as proposed.  it's great to see all the interest and folks jumping in.  Taking the high level end to end interoperability data/workflows, and dividing up and conquering may be the way to go.  Then testing at connectathon or with pilots.  Been on CIMI calls where they have some overlap with some of the data elements as they published with Logica model late last week.  </p>\n<p>Still need to respond on the ELR and LRI paths, data, and how it could be leveraged for the FEMA/WH reporting.</p>",

One of the misnomers that media has been spreading (faster than the virus) is drive up testing, when the reality has been drive up specimen collection and the samples sent else where for testing by a trained laboratory professional.  FDA has classified these as moderate to high complexity test systems, so per CLIA law only laboratory professionals can perform.  However, a number of CLIA requirements have been relaxed during the public health emergency, and have seen Walgreens rolling out the Abbott ID Now devices at locations too with pharmacists performing ordering and resulting.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Continuing the lab information flow....  We discussed lab catalog (from LIS)--&gt; consumed by EHR.  Used to populate CPOE systems to generate patient instance Lab Orders Interfacing (LOI) messages for the order sent to the performing lab. --&gt;  order and specimen are received by performing lab in the lab's LIS.   The specimen is processed and sent to the lab bench or analyzer for analysis.  There's a \"shell\" of the order and results fields (which are blank), in the LIS build, where the test result values are entered for verification and reporting.  </p>\n<p>Let's look at the AOE's with an example of a 24 hour timed urine calcium.  In this case, two AOE's, one for Total Volume of the specimen and another for total hours of collection of the specimen are required data for the laboratory to perform testing.  Perhaps the hours of collection were 23.5 and volume was 1000 mL.  Both are entered by the person collecting the specimen.  (Although some laboratories will measure the volume upon receipt in the lab.)  An aliquot or portion is placed in a tube to be analyzed by the instrument that generates the calcium result which travels across the interface between the instrument and LIS to populate the test result value in the LIS.  There's a field for this spot/random urine calcium, and once populated, the LIS uses the volume and hours of collection to calculate a 24 hour urine calcium rate, which is reported back to the ordering provider for clinical decision making and  patient care.  To recap, the AOEs are reported back as test results and test result values that are part of a panel (more than one result) reported from the LIS to EHR. </p>\n<p>For COVID-19, there may be an AOE that is specimen source, requiring the specimen collector to enter whether a nasopharangeal swab is collected or an oral swab is collected and sent to the laboratory. Specimen source is an important field for public health reporting for a variety of tests as certain organisms/results/reportable conditions (such as MRSA) are only reported from sterile sources.  That is, if a culture identifies MRSA in a skin wound specimen, it may not be reportable to public health, but if it is identified in a sterile specimen like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), then it is.  Of course, all COVID-19 results are reportable, but it's been reported that oral swabs have a 30% less positive rate for identification than nasopharangeal swabs and thus a patient result may be negative, when they have the disease, a false negative.  In short, AOEs provide important data and results that are essential for lab testing, clinical decision making and patient care, and public health reporting/epidemiology.</p>\n<p>Regarding patient demographics, they are usually entered in patient registration, and other \"non lab\" screens/fields of the EHR.  A number of these data may be part of the Admission, Discharge, and Transfer (ADT) system and transmitted in other parts of the HL7 message like PID.  Additionally, these populate the LIS to provide required CLIA information (patient name, birthdate, etc.) required by the laboratory.   Birthdate and gender are also important as they may drive certain laboratory reference ranges, depending on the results.</p>\n<p>Reportable conditions are determined by each jurisdiction, usually the state or territorial public health department.  In some larger metros, there are city and county health depts. too (i.e. Houston and Harris County, Chicago and Cook County, Phiadelphia, NY City/NY State, LA / LA County, San Francisco).  With ELR, all labs are required to submit to the state health department level, whereby the public health information system processed the inbound ELR messages and then notifies the county and city level health depts. of cases.</p>",

        "content": "<p>A bit about ELR.  It is required by law of any laboratory (in the US) performing testing that meets reportable condition reporting criteria.  Each jurisdicition determiens criteria so reporting requirements differ by each jurisdiction (which also drives LIS and EHR vendors crazy as they have to maintain the one offs).  That said, Meaningful Use Stage 1, 2, 3 included it as a requirement of hospital labs to use the HL7 v2.51 messaging IG, along with LOINC for lab orders and results, UCUM for units, and SNOMED CT for qualitative result values, specimen type, specimen source, organism, and qualifiers for specimen tye and/or source.  Functional requirements for ELR have been included in vendor certification requirements.  </p>\n<p>Initially with MU, LIS vendors didn't get certified as the ONC language was geared towards EHRs.  However, Farzad Mostashari and others confirmed if the functionality is performed by the LIS it is considered part of the EHR system for MU criteria.   So many of the LIS vendors became certified for this functioanlity (but not other functionality such as e prescirbing sinc eit's not a funciton of their informaiton systems, but rather the EHR) (I participated on the Laboratory Interopeability Collaborative, CDC funded initiative to assist over 1000 hospital labs with ELR, including over 100 Critical Access Hospitals.  We taught ELR, SNOMED CT and LOINC mapping and ELR needs to laboratory professionals and public health in about half of the public health jurisdictions/states during the funding period. )  </p>\n<p>One note about ELR functionality.  For instances where there is a separate LIS and EHR, which are interfaced, the LIS would be certified if the ELR message is sent directly to public health in conjunction with the results message sent to the ordering provider's EHR (which shoudl be in an Lab Results Interface or LRI HL7 message).  In theory these messages should contain the same information, but some vendors have different interfaces set up and LOINC or SCT codes may be sent to public health and not the EHR.  (not sure why.)  Others require to ask the performign lab to \"turn on\" codes in the messages they send so downstream systems can receive.  Some LISs share a combined database with the EHR and ELR functionality may be in another module of the EHR whereby ELR messages are generated and sent.  In other cases, the LIS doesn't have ELR functionality, but the EHR was certified and so the message is sent to the EHR, and the ELR message is sent.  In another scenario, an HIE or public health entity may add SCT and LOINC codes to the message and/or convert a v2.31 message into a v.251 so it's otherwise compliant and then this intermediary sends the message on to to public healt to fulfil requirements.  </p>\n<p>It's imperative, that any AOE questions and demographics be sent by the ordering/collecting person to the performing lab with the specimen.  If these critical data are not reeived by the performing lab, they are not able to be communicated to public health by law.  Public health has reported these failures occurring with many drive up specimen collection locations for COVID-19.  Hopefully, by getting the word out and educating those originating the orders, this can be easily rectified.  </p>\n<p>Another reason appropriate coding is essential in ELR messages is public health has limited resources and their information systems are set up to automatically process and route reportables to the appropriate area handing them.  Some health depts have a separate HIV area or TB area.  They have used LOINC codes to route certain lab results to these areas.  IF coding is not provided, it delays processing as a person needs to manually process the message.  I'll also mention with different reporting crieria by each jurisdiciton, some also want other lab results such as liver function testins or a CBC to be reported for certain reportable conditions.  Others have criteria whereby suspicion of disease is reported, which includes any orders (regardless if they are pos).  We are seeing this aspect with COVID-19 testing whereby the FEMA/White House/HHS summary reports required hospital labs to report both orders and results and many public health jurisdictions are showing # of pending lab results on their public health websites</p>\n<p>It would be ideal if public health could take all the reportable ELR messages and sumamrize them for WH/FEMA reporting, but challenges still remain.  The largest challenge is although ELR is required by law of all labs performign testing, some are still sending in fax or flatfile or other formats to public health and not using ELR.  Why?  you may ask.  Keep in mind MU was only required of Hospital labs, therefore other types of labs reporting are required to submit ELR, but they can stil send in HL7 2.31 messages, fax or other means as the way of reporting may not be specified for them.  There are many laboraotries who have not adopted LOINC, SNOMED CT, and updated HL7 standards.  The largest segment of CLIA labs in teh US (&gt;200,000) are Physician Office Labs (POLS), but there are also blood bank, govt/DoD (which have their own requirements),  and independent labs.  Many small labs are not doing COVID-19 testing, but the indepedendent labs are.  The large reference labs like LabCorp and Quest are providing LOINC and SNOMED CT codes in their ELR messages to which they report to every jurisdiction (since they have a large national/global footprint).  However, small reference labs are not reporting LOINC and SNOMEDCT and in some cases may be issuign paper reports still, which also drives provider nuts from an interoperability perspective.  It creates a lot of work for a downstream system to enter or convert these results into a structured format/discrete data with appropriate coding in their EHRs so it's computer processible.  Many times these reports may be scanned and saved as a pdf electronically as a result.  (Sad, but true.)</p>\n<p>In short, there is room for improvement in the current landscape.  Mostly it's funding and resources needed to get these labs up to the same standards as required for MU/ELR so everyone can report the same way from an interopeability perspective.  I offered public comments last year on many of these challenges in response to ONC's NPRM on Promoting Interoperability.  Most funding was directed to hospitals and elgible providers, but snce th elaboratory provides over 70% of data utiized in clinical decision making and the EHR, it's a key need that needs similar finaincial assistance. Many labs are just trying to keep up with testing demands for providing quality patient care (before COVID-19) and have received decreased reimburesements due to the PAMA law impacts which has forced some to close.  Hopefuly, their criticality amidst the COVID-19 testing is realized and additional support is provided, so patient care doesn't suffer.  That said, some IT upgrades and projects may be put on hold as resources are not currently available, even though they are critically needed.  (Public health has echoed similar contraints on PHER calls.  They are just trying to keep ther heads above water when swamped with COVID-19 responses.)</p>\n<p>One other HL7 implementation guide that would be very helpful is the EHR-S guide for receipt of lab results in the EHR.  It along with updates to eDOS, LOI, LRI and ELR have created an interoperable ecosystem for lab results.  However, eDOS, LOI, and LRI were in the MU Stage 3 proposed rule and pulled in the final rule.  Thus many have not adopted and implemented these HL7 standard voluntarily (although some may have done so.).  Without the regulatory carrot, there haven't been many incentives for labs to adopt said standards.  Why would they perform upgrades if it takes away from providing resources for patient care or they may need to cut staff as a result?  From a business perspective, the laboratory is running on a thread and unfortunately extra resources may not available for such costly upgrades.    Help is needed both in terms of education and funding to implement.  </p>\n<p>A similar aspect applies to some LIS and EHR vendors.  I mentioned some interfaces don't have codesystem capabilities or an interface may still be on HL7 2.31 messaging.  These are expensive to upgrade.  Also if a LIS doesn't have functionality around encoding and messaging the data, a laboratory can't implement without the needed functionality.  MU has gone a long ways to spur adoption, but independent labs don't have to have MU certified systems.  They may have older LISs which lack some of the functionality needed for adopting the standards and why they are still faxing or sending paper reports.  Lack of technical functionality can be a major barrier to adopting and implementing standards.</p>",
