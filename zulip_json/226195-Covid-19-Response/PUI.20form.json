We didn't get to encoding it in a Questionnaire or anything, but it's a pretty good start on the UI if anyone might find it helpful (and it's Apache 2.0 licensed).

Documentation is minimal, but to run it, clone the repo, run <code>yarn install</code>, and then run <code>yarn start</code>.

Much more complicated data here! If there is support (meaning the effort will likely move along) I'd like to help out. In particular I'd hope this would be supported by CDC and ONC. Any chance of that?</p>",
