Earlier this week, a specific PULSE-COVID19 version went live as a participant on the eHealth Exchange Network (look for Patient Unified Lookup Systems for Emergencies on this page: <a href=\"https://ehealthexchange.org/participants/\" title=\"https://ehealthexchange.org/participants/\">https://ehealthexchange.org/participants/</a>) .  All participants are being alerted that they may begin receiving queries from public health via this connection.  In addition, the eHealth Exchange is in the final testing processes to go live on the Carequality Framework that connects 24 other networks today.</p>",

All this to say that the connectivity is almost complete to allow for data access potentially with the Navy ships and other deployments by federal partners to assist in this need for the US.  We onboarded PULSE COVID19 in record time (2-3 days) through testing.  I applaud the ongoing efforts that Sequoia, eHealth Exchange and Carequality are making to start gathering all the information that is needed by providers and public health.  This currently deployed infrastructure could be augmented to support FHIR exchange of data and Carequality just announced on their informational call today that they are fast tracking their publication of a HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide.  The slides from the call with links to all draft guides can be found here: <a href=\"https://carequality.org/wiki/monthly-communication-call/\" title=\"https://carequality.org/wiki/monthly-communication-call/\">https://carequality.org/wiki/monthly-communication-call/</a>.
