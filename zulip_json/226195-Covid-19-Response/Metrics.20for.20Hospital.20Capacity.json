Neither <code>Measure.group</code> nor <code>Measure.supplementalData</code> are required fields.  But they could be, within a profile.  And we happen to have a US Core profile that exists at the appropriate level for coordinating all of these activities.  Perhaps we could profile the <code>Measure</code> and <code>MeasureReport</code> resources to require inclusion of Device and Location data when reporting ICU bed data.  That could harmonize the granular reporting and the metric reporting, and allow slicing/dicing of data after the fact.  It could be summarized in a simple rule of \"Don't send an ICU metric unless you include the basic underlying device and location counts with it.'  Fairly easy to understand and implement.</p>",
