It's based on two populations, a numerator and a denominator, with a common initial population.  These are described in Measure.</p>\n<p>\"best\" is evaluating from  a perspective that isn't really expressed.  What I'm reading is \"best\" is being evaluated as what is easiest to produce based on a certain context.  I agree, what you suggest is certainly extremely easy to produce.  </p>\n<p>But it lacks conveyance of meaning and semantics.  We do the hard work of that by describing Measure using our expertise, which is what makes it easy to map these fields subsequently into MeasureReport.  The layout of Measure tells a system where to stick stuff in a MeasureReport, and we have a very simple way to express a collection of numbers as name value pairs that can be \"dumped into\" a measure report based on code... be it population.code or group.code.</p>\n<p>Yes, there's a little more complexity in the expression of MeasureReport, but not so much b/c it's guided by Measure.</p>\n<p>Let's address this as a hot topic tomorrow as you say, b/c if you are blocked, then I am too.</p>\n<p>As for % positive and % negative, yes, that could conceivably happen, BUT, we hope to avoid that by getting people to create measures smartly, instead of throwing spreadsheets over the wall.  We're starting to get the kind of attention needed to make that happen through process and policy.</p>",

If we're going to treat them as measures, that implies a certain approach, which has a set of semantics that we should use.  If we're going to treat them as fill in the blank forms, that's a different approach.  They aren't \"incompatible\" with each other, but they do have some implications with respect to structure that we should consider.  I like the idea of having an A leads to B approach from Questionnaire --&gt; MeasureReport but we only got to that point last week and haven't adopted it fully.  I think we want to explore that further.  Questionnaire has less implicit structure and can easily address the \"use this one common structure\" mechanism to simply address the need, and that can map through to MeasureReport.</p>\n<p>There's some benefit there as well due to alignment with the NHSN IGs which we should also review.</p>",
