However I believe the intention behind the FHIR create interaction is for the server to auto-generate a new ID and return that info in the 201 response. So look at the response payload for the actual ID that was created. It should be in the Location response header, and also the full resource is included as the response payload (unless a return=minimal Prefer header was used).</p>\n<p>You can also alternatively use the update interaction instead, if you want to create a resource while preserving your own ID. We have the \"updateCreate\" option enabled for the MeasureReport resource.</p>",
