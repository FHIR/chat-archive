ELR is required by law of all labs performing COVID-19 testing  to respective jurisdictions (albein most is HL7 v 2.51).  Seems like need to assist public health and hospitals in reporting directly to HHS.  <br>\n(may only be able to lurk here occassionally due to my day job, but in case this helps jumpstart the need.)</p>",
