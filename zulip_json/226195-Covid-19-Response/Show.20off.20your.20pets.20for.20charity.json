Short version:  sourdough requires daily feeding, and is a _really_ good way to structure your day and to create a daily routine/schedule.  It's also a precursor ingredient to pretty much every conceivable bread product, from bread to pizza to pita to bagels and more, and lets owners focus on problems of procuring meats and veggies.  It's an excellent practice for improving food security.   </p>\n<p>tl;dr - food security and creating a daily routine.  $0.02</p>",
