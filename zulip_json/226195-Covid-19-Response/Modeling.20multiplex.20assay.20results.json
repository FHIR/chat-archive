I haven't seen guidance on how to report the potentially <code>1..*</code> coded results. For example, to say \"we detected Influenza A and also SARS-CoV-2\", I can imagine a few ways:</p>\n<p>1) A single DiagnosticReport with one Observation; both resources coded as 95423-0, and the Observation has a single valueCodeableConcept with multiple codings (one LA11919-0 for Influenza A, and one LA31065-8 for SARS-CoV-2).<br>\n2) A single DiagnosticReport with two Observations -- all resources coded as 95423-0, and each Observation containing a single valueCodeableConcept (one LA11919-0 for Influenza A, and one LA31065-8 for SARS-CoV-2).<br>\n3) A single DiagnosticReport with one Observation both resources coded as 95423-0, and the Observation has two components -- but while the component values would be the LA31065-8 and LA11919-0, I'm not sure how I'd populate the component codes).</p>\n<p>To me #1 makes the most sense, because (compared with #3) I know how to write it down, and (compared with #2) it never puts an interpreting party in the position of seeing an Observation with incomplete results. But it seems to overload the intention behind multiple codings in Observation.valueCodeableConcept.coding[]. If there are other considerations, or if best practices have been developed already I'd love to learn more.</p>\n<p>(<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197152\">@Preston Lee</span>  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191411\">@Nathan Davis</span> I know you've been involved in some profiling work with Logica.

Why not just  make it a lab panel?  As a form question its very pre-coordinated.  Which is okay but it shouldn't be used to define a single lab test.  I think there should be two separate codes.
