And there is the _basis_, which determines what kinds of things are actually in the population. The _scoring_ then layers on top of that to decide whether what we're measuring is a proportion or a continuous variable, or a ratio, or whatever. And obviously, a proportion measure can be expressed as two continuous variable measures that you would then have to understand as the numerator and denominator of a fraction. After looking at this spreadsheet, that is exactly what is being done with a lot of these continuous-variable measures, they are expressing the numerator and denominator of a proportion, but it's relevant because we actually care what the values are, not just the resulting fraction.</p>",

If you can automate MeasureReport from Measure (especially if we provide tools to enable that), getting to CSV or other formats from MeasureReport is easy.

FHIR enables us to define push and pull APIs to access the material, and ways to convert to other formats.  3.

I think the easy stuff should be clear and easy to define a Measure for and its not.    For example  The CDC csv is a half a dozen counts and is IMO well defined (while the FEMA template is a not).  It was not immediately apparent to me to use cohort and list them as groups.  Then there is the table in the QM guide that I followed and defines the pop type codes to use.  Then <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191315\">@Josh Mandel</span> suggests to ignore scoring and type and glom everything into one measure.   I am not saying one approach is better than the other but by allowing these differing approaches then we are fooling ourselves into believing \"you can automate MeasureReport from Measure (especially if we provide tools to enable that),\".  Instead you have to read each measure and code to it.   IMO, That is where we are today.</p>",

I can claim to have some experience in this space.  We demonstrated one of them using data from I2B2.  The biggest challenge in automation is mapping from institution local codes to the code sets used to define the expressions that the measure evaluates.  The other challenge is ensuring that the institution's data model matches the model expected by the measure.  Yes, there's always going to be adaptation, but CQL actual makes a lot of that simpler in that you can isolate the adaptation pieces in the measure logic.  Location identification is clearly going to be a huge challenge, because right now, the \"type\" of a location is a lot more dynamic than it used to be.  Even so, that challenge can be factored into the measure in such a way that it can be addressed in a number of different ways.  A number of organizations are already computing measures directly from CMS measure definitions from collections of CCDA data.  There's certainly customization, but it's not \"coding to each measure\".  It's more like configuring each measure for the institution, and that's a different skill set than \"Code to each measure\".</p>",

What Gino had published a week or two ago.  And simply running them through our software.   I think my main points of contribution is that <code>group.description</code> and <code>criteria.name</code> should be filled out, as well as the author/editor/reviewer workflow.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Yeah, the existing example definitions for \"topic\" are hard to apply.  They are focused on patient associated processes, treatment, education, assessment.  It's hardly clear what the right set of classifiers are yet for measures.  When you have 100 measures, it's pretty easy to figure out how you want to cluster them.  When you have four or five, four of which are just mirrors of the same measure with different \"treatment services\" (e.g., Acute, Long-Term Care, Rehab, Psychiatric care), but others are very differently focused.</p>\n<p>As for Measure type, well, in fact, we are working with MeasureReport more as a \"report card\" on an institution, which might include several groups and populations, with each group potentially having a different \"type\" of measure.  Consider an academic report card, in which a student gets a letter grade for certain subjects, a pass/fail for others, and feedback on number of days present or absent.  That's ONE report card, four different groups of data, and yet still \"One report\", not a \"bundle of separate reports\" just because the types of each report are different.</p>\n<p>So, we created an extension on group to capture \"measure type\" at the group level.  And, yes, that will be feedback on R5.  Because doing it that way won't critically impact existing quality measures in any way that we can determine.  They'll still be able to be adequately defined with the same concepts, but we have a little bit more versatility in MeasureReport which allows it to be used and communicated more efficiently.</p>",
