Servers need to have the option to require multiple of these.  For example, unless someone is searching by ID, we are probably going to require a measure and at least one of location and period.</p>",

But for the purposes of an IG, it helps to pick one (or both) to be explicit.  It's common to provide a sequence diagram in IGs.  So, I'm thinking a) define the usecase describing a client with pull architecture, b) provide a sequence diagram, c) document API calls.</p>",
