As part of this, the patients are asked for the general type of test they had (e.g. something like PCR/antigen/rapid antibody). LOINC has plenty of codes for Corona tests, but they are all very specific and require knowledge of the details of the test protocol that patients would essentially never have. The lack of broader codes seems to be a a matter of explicit choice, cf. the FAQ here: <a href=\"https://loinc.org/sars-coronavirus-2/\">https://loinc.org/sars-coronavirus-2/</a>. Has anyone already dealt with this issue, e.g are there alternative standardized codes to allow more coarse-grained reporting/patient reporting?</p>",
