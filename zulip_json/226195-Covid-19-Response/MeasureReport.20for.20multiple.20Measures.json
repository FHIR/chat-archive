For interoperability purposes, we're going to  want MeasureReport.measure to be the CDC Measure.  That means we lose the Epic Measure.  This isn't a big deal in this case - nobody cares that it's our Measure.  But what if CDC and FEMA each define Measures for the same metric?  Does a reporter need to create two copies of the same MeasureReport identical in every way but the measure?</p>",
