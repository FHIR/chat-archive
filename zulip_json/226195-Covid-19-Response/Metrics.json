And David's comment about \"negative pressure rooms\" or \"positive pressure rooms\" may also be helpful.  I don't know or any specific measures/reports currently in development or use but I see them as valuable.  The \"measure\" would need to be focused on facilities (not patients) for which there is reference in the IGs. What resource would you consider to express the required data? Looking at Epic's set above, I might consider Questionnaire/QuestionnaireResponse with each as an observation if using FHIR for exchange - and consider location resource for hospital and hospital settings (note US Core and QI-Core may limit location for use as reference to a single patient).   NOTE - all of this information has been identified as essential to share for public health and pandemic planning for a number of years but I am not aware of a pervasive systematic collection capability that can be \"turned on\" when needed at times like these.</p>",
