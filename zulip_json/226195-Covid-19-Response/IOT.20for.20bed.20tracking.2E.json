The software and the hardware design is <a href=\"https://github.com/lucatoldo/fhir-ebutton\" title=\"https://github.com/lucatoldo/fhir-ebutton\">https://github.com/lucatoldo/fhir-ebutton</a> . I am also creating a version of the FHIR for use in embedded devices (currently the FHIR that my hardware generates is directly written in C++... a library would be much better). <a href=\"https://github.com/lucatoldo/arduino-fhir\" title=\"https://github.com/lucatoldo/arduino-fhir\">https://github.com/lucatoldo/arduino-fhir</a>. The \"arduinoFHIR\" library just started, I have simply autogenerated c++ from the xsd using the xsde tool. If anyone wants to contribute / assess / review / use those activities is very welcome.</p>\n<p>Currently I am implementing the DigitalSignature, using  <a href=\"https://bearssl.org/\" title=\"https://bearssl.org/\">https://bearssl.org/</a>. If anyone has interest into Digital Signature implementation is also welcome.</p>",
