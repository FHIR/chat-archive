        "content": "<p>Another thing to note is that inferno is currently tuned pretty aggressively when validating resources against the SANER profiles in that it validates all resources returned from every search against it.  In reality the link between the restful interface and the profile conformance is weak.  A server may rightfully return MeasureReports that do not meet the PublicHealthMeasureReport profile because it also supports other use cases for things like search by date.  As a <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179175-argonaut/topic/How.20do.20servers.20%27claim.20conformance%27.20to.20a.20profile.3F\">previous chat.fhir discussion touched on</a>, this is a bigger deal for testers than clients.  For a tester, unless the resource claims in the meta.profile that it meets the profile, then its pretty much impossible to know if that resource <em>should</em> conform to a specific profile for any restful interaction.  We can do, and have done, things that narrow down resources to be validated either on an IG level or a system-under-test level (e.g. all resources with a <code>code = x</code> SHALL conform to the profile and <code>x</code> is a parameter that can be provided to inferno).</p>\n<p>From a Connectathon perspective it's probably not a huge deal because then you at least see everything.  But, I think we might change the configuration to only validate the resource from the input id specified.</p>",
