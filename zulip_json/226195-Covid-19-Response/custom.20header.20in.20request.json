There were good reasons for that in the development of FHIR oriented workflows.  Thats fine in Postman but I don't know if this is generally true with REST clients.  Would including a custom header be problematic for anyone that will be making requests to my API for Connectathon.  It is always a single custom header named 'add-service-properties' and contains a valid JSON string.</p>",
