I bring up the questions about zero sum games vs socially cooperative games, because I think a) we have the current mandates because we (society, congress, etc) want self-correcting feedback loops in place, b) maps provide actionable artifacts that people can make decisions on, so c) we're heading towards some sort of gamification or forecasting usages of this data.  Whether that gamification is government reports, meteorologists updating their maps, or some sort of dystopian Hunger Games, I don't know.  </p>\n<p>But even within that premise, there's a bunch of different ways to go about it.  I bring up zero-sum games vs socially cooperative games, because the maps we create can be zero-sum bounded or open-ended.  That's the difference between a choropleth and heatmap.  Choropleth maps account for every square inch of space in the US.  Every square foot of land gets assigned to a county, state, health service area, or some other region.  (The IPPS data file that Josh Mandel found was particularly useful in that regard, because not only does it have the CMS hospital numbers, it also provided the cross-walk to the Health Service Area (HSA) shapefile regions.)  Regardless, that boundedness  makes it zero sum, in so far as real estate is fixed and the counts have to be applied to a region in order to be visualized.  If you want to cross reference census data with it, you can zero-sum it further with a cap of ~330M citizens, and calculate a percentage for each region in the choropleth.  </p>\n<p>Alternatively, an heatmap is open-ended.  Have illegal immigrants or undocumented populations?  They just increase intensity on the map.  But you can't really do a county-by-county quarantine.  But you could calculate risk based on proximity to other hotzones.  </p>\n<p>We can do either approach.  They both have pros/cons, and offer something a bit different.  But for a choropleth map with bounded inputs and a zero-sum approach, the unknown populations necessarily need to get grouped in with existing regions (or somehow eliminated/removed - a distressingly unpleasant and very problematic notion in the context of healthcare and pandemic).  For a heatmap, they simply need to be harmonized and avoid double counting.  </p>\n<p>Also, leaderboards.  Same problem, different dimensions.  When this is all in place, there will naturally be a leaderboard.  Is it the hospitals?  The counties?  The states?  Is anybody allowed to participate?  What about Puerto Rico?  Or the international space station?  Are we only allowing hospitals with CMS numbers on the leaderboard (zero sum)?  Or do we allow any field hospital to register itself?  What about the Navajo Nation?  My contacts in the National Parks Service is saying that things are real bad on the reservations, many of which don't have running water so soap doesn't work even if they have it on hand.  </p>\n<p>$0.02</p>",

At the very least, there’s some trigonometry involved with the spatial coordinates.  And it quickly grows as the cartographer adds geography, census data, economics, meteorology, etc.  That’s the art of cartography!  SANER is simply the way that the variables get fed into the mapping algorithms (from the Consumer’s point of view).    </p>\n<p>As far as SANER scope goes, I’d like to see some language like the following…  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A MeasureProducer that generates a MeasureReport of type <code>summary</code> SHOULD set the <code>MeasureReport.group.population.code</code> as <code>initial-population</code>. <br>\nAn Intermediary that combines multiple MeasureReports of type <code>individual</code> SHALL update the type to <code>summary</code>. <br>\nAn Intermediary that combines multiple MeasureReports SHALL preserve all data elements. (wording?) <br>\nAn Intermediary that combines multiple MeasureReports of type ‘individual’ SHOULD set the <code>MeasureReport.group.population.code</code> to a value of <code>measure-population</code>. <br>\nA MeasureConsumer that consumes MeasureReports of type <code>summary</code> SHOULD use a choropleth (MapType ValueSet TBD) </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Keep in mind, that even adding this stuff in, there will remain plenty of policy and political factors outside the scope of SANER.  Even with these rules, choropleths can be produced to advocate for both continued lockdown or reopening.</p>",
