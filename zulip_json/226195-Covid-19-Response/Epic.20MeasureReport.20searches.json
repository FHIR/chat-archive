But I'm seeing a 'bad request' reply when searching for FEMA measures using <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/saner/Measure/FEMADailyHospitalCOVID19Reporting\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/saner/Measure/FEMADailyHospitalCOVID19Reporting</a> as the measure. Am I doing something wrong? Is this a known issue?
