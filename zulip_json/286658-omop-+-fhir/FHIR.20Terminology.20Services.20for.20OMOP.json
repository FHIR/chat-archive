Does anyone know if this exists, and where I could find it? happy to be pointed to a collection of wiki pages that require a bit of digging as well.</p>\n<p>One small question that I had: were the authors of this aware of the the OMOP concept_relationship table, and the other sorts of <a href=\"https://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=documentation:cdm:relationship\">relationships that can be found between concepts</a>?  I think it addresses the below point. If not, I'd be interested to know why not.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[OMOP] is distinctly less powerful because it does not <br>\nretain information relating to “role grouping”. Hence it may not be possible to determine which <br>\nbody structure a particular morphology applies to...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/4168066\">SNOMED 275476006 [Foreign body under eyelid]</a> retains the relationships \"Has associated morphology (SNOMED) - SNOMED 125245002 [Retained foreign body]\" and \"Has finding site (SNOMED) - SNOMED 80243003 [Eyelid structure]\"</p>",

There are YouTube videos available with background &amp; instruction on FHIR terminologies.   Also  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191405\">@Rob Hausam</span> has a workshop coming up in a couple of weeks where he provides terminology basics: <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/events/webinar/fhir/terminology/2021/\">http://www.hl7.org/events/webinar/fhir/terminology/2021/</a> </p>\n<p>Im looking forward to our meeting later today!</p>",
