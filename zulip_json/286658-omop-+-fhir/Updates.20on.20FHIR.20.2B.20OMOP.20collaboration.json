So, CDMH was a good start for OMOP but it was really thin and not  thorough enough for an implementer to use. On a side note, I really enjoyed the AMIA COVID-19 research paper which touched on the integration of FHIR and OMOP CDMs (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jamia/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jamia/ocab108/6276433\">https://academic.oup.com/jamia/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jamia/ocab108/6276433</a>), but this also didn't provide enough information.

For our next health equity workgroup meeting (Tuesday, November 2nd at 2PM Eastern), we plan to discuss terminologies and mappings for patient-level social determinants of health, risk factors, and needs, and other domains useful for health equity research. I'm interested in seeing how the OMOP+FHIR collaboration could look in this space, especially given the work of project Gravity. Is there anyone here familiar enough with Gravity that would be able to participate in this meeting? Possibly giving a 5-7 minute overview of the work and terminologies?</p>",
