This is the only HL7/OHDSI partnership use case focused on translation from FHIR to OMOP - the others are converting from OMOP to FHIR. Therefore, we welcome any one that is interested, regardless of clinical domain, to join us in this exploration and effort.<br>\nFeel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or are interested in participating!</p>",
