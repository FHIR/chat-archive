Depending on mapping OMOP to what FHIR profiles (core resources with or without custom extensions, US core, anything else) you need to choose how to handle that. So, any mapping implementation from OMOP to one particular set of FHIR resources will not easily be reusable by another.<br>\nWouldn't it be more efficient in the long run if we'd model the OMOP data model in FHIR logical models and create one custom set of scripts that transforms the data between those.<br>\nThen every next project would only need to map between FHIR logical model conformant data to their profiles of choice, for example with the Mapping Language.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maxim Moinat (who promised to create a Zulip account) pointed out yet another mapping between FHIR (US Core) and the OMOP CDM: <a href=\"https://github.com/OHDSI/FhirToCdm\">https://github.com/OHDSI/FhirToCdm</a></p>",
