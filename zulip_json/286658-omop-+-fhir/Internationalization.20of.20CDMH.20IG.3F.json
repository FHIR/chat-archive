        "content": "<p>Hello everyone,<br>\nin Germany, we are currently working on a project in which I write my PhD. It contains a mapping from FHIR to OMOP (and probably vice versa) for wound related data. I just had a look at the Implementation guide May referenced in another stream (<a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cdmh/index.html\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cdmh/index.html</a>), but it seems to be quite US-specific. Therefore my question: If it is intended to be US-specific, is there any intention to lift it to an international basis? I ask because the mappings contain several extensions we don't have in Germany, which limits its applicability for us.<br>\nThanks in advance for your answers.</p>",

But should it not better be <code>hospitalization.dischargeDisposition</code>? <br>\nIf I understand correctly, <code>location</code>is where the patient has been, and <code>hospitalization.dischargeDisposition</code> where the patient shall be discharged to. The description for <code>discharge_to_concept_id</code> seems to be more applicable to the latter.<br>\nDo I see that correctly, or am I mistaken? In the latter case, can someone explain to me what I get wrong? <br>\nThank you in advance for your help.</p>",
