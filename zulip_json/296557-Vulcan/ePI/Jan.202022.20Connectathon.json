If I go to <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/directory.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/directory.html</a> and try to manually download the r5.0.0-shapshot1 package I get a 404 error. However, I am able to download the \"stable\" release 4.0.1.</p>\n<p>I don't know who we should contact to resolve this... Any suggestions?</p>",
