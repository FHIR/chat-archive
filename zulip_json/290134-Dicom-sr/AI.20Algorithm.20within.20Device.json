Parent is the software itself, and then having one child per algorithm. Still you have the ambiguity that it has to be specified as other on <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/device-nametype\">http://hl7.org/fhir/device-nametype</a> as there is nothing for AI. I'll give it a try.</p>",

Using the hierarchy the fields just fit in quite well with the device structure. On Tuesday we will discuss this at the II call, so we'll come with a resolution (hopefully).</p>",
