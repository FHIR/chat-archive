If I refer to SR Objects created by an AI algorithm, definitely it isn't a Diagnostic Report. If I query for the Diagnostic Reports for this patient, I don't want to see data created by a machine, but the legal document signed by a radiologist.<br>\nb) Another point is the code of the wrapper, which code to be used? DICOM TID1500? If so, how to encode this? TID_1500? TID1500? Or is it a LOINC code as it is no longer a DICOM artifact but a FHIR generated one? If so, when querying LOINC there are the following options, which one is the correct one?<br>\n18782-3 Radiology Study observation (narrative) Study observation<br>\n19005-8 Radiology Imaging study [Impression] (narrative)    Imaging study<br>\n68604-8 Radiology Diagnostic study note Diagnostic study note<br>\nor even<br>\n18834-2 Radiology Comparison study (narrative)  <a href=\"http://Comparison.study\">Comparison.study</a><br>\nc) Still the mapping from the 3 flags to status, is then the preliminary flag mapped to the observation status and verification flag to the wrapper status flag? Are the 3 flags really needed?<br>\nd) Which are the equivalent codes for the different flags, some are straight forward like preliminary; unverified for example which value is the best? An extension to the valueSet cannot be considered as an  option.  <br>\nI hope these points get addressed soon, as the rest of the mapping documented works quite fine.</p>",
