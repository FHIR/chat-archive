We're coming at it from multiple angles, one of which is using SNOMED-CT clinical findings such as <a href=\"https://snomedbrowser.com/Codes/Details/105502003\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://snomedbrowser.com/Codes/Details/105502003\">105502003 - Dependence on renal dialysis (finding)</a>.  Would this type of concept generally be represented as a Condition or an Observation?  Some people on the team think it's more of an Observation, but are troubled since we'd usually use LOINC as an Observation.code and SNOMED as the value (and there is no obvious LOINC code for this one).  We've noticed that Argonaut's Problem List Value Set including SNOMED Clinical Findings, so it may be appropriate as a Condition.  Just looking for some guidance/confirmation...</p>",

        "content": "<p>Both the phrases Graham notes are flavors of a SNOMED \"finding\" which includes all things from conditions, diagnosis, symptoms, and an observation result. We really do not want to create an observable (LOINC idea) like \"Is the patient dependent on renal dialysis?\" with a \"finding\" of Yes or No. You might imagine an observable of \"renal function\" but the value for that are all over the map (results of a particular test like GFR or Creatine clearance, to a general statement like the one noted.) I'd say this is simply a \"condition\" with the SCT code noted. If you want to create a complex way of identifying the idea of dependence on dialysis that could look for lab value indicators, OR an appropriate SCT condition code, that might be the most complete. Of course, you'll need a nephrologist review your work!</p>",
