This source should have all needed postal \"states\" and other locations (outlying areas, etc.). None of the links you provide actually have the current official set other than the ansi one and that one is not easily downloadable. I suspect you are correct in your assertions and if they were willing to scrape the content off the census/ansi page, they would be on the way... But... they would then need to be told how to manage this code system that has two different identifiers, and determine all the metadata. They are adversely inclined to do that sort of thing. If others suggested what you have suggested (I've already given them a document suggesting this sort of things years ago), then perhaps they will move forward. I may even be on the development schedule.</p>",
