But in general, consents could be given for multiple purposes. </p>\n<p>In Sweden, the consent for biobank mean consent to store the material for the purpose of treatment, research, quality assurance and development of healthcare. In that case I have trouble understanding how that could be mapped to FHIR's scope and category. </p>\n<p>What are the Sweden policy rules you are referring to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"301904\">@Roberta Severin</span> ?

I will take a look at that Jira-issue!<br>\nRegarding if the resource is used for patient privacy, treatment or research - do you mean that for the biological sample, it would require multiple consents as the sample could be used for both treatment and research? <br>\nIn Sweden, it is possible for the patient to give consent for both purposes with one consent. But, if the patient would like to restrict what the sample could be used for, the patient can restrict this but by specifying it on the same consent. But maybe that would be a case of actually registering multiple consents in the electronic system even though the paper the patient can use for the consent is just one paper. </p>\n<p>Regarding quality assurance and development of healthcare - maybe that can be considered as belonging to the research case as you suggest. I haven't thought about it in that way. I would need to take a look at what the definition of research could be, if it's possible to include it or not. I do know though that the purposes often are separated if it regards research or quality - for example in the biobank law they state both research, quality assurance and development of methods as separate purposes. </p>\n<p>In documentation about the biobank law, it explains that samples can be used to compare if new methods give comparable results, it can also be used for teaching purposes which is another way to develop healthcare.</p>",
