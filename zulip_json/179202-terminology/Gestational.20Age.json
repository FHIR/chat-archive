We started looking at LOINC 11884-4 (Gestational age Estimated) and SNOMED 412726003 Length of gestation at birth (observable entity), but after dissecting the codes (especially SNOMED), we got twisted because gestation is defined as \"the process of <strong>carrying or being carried</strong> in the womb between conception and birth\"<br>\nThe issue is when a single patient's chart has her own gestational age at birth documented as well as her child's gestational age (at the time of delivery).  <br>\nI believe the FHIR extension, <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/extension-observation-focal-subject.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/extension-observation-focal-subject.html\">http://build.fhir.org/extension-observation-focal-subject.html</a>, helps clarify the subject when subject (fetus) differs from patient.  I'm just curious whether terminology can also be used to differentiate these 2 observations (mom's gestational age at birth when mom was a baby  -- versus -- mom's fetus' gestational age when mom was pregnant)?</p>",

In any case, the default attribution is \"patient\" for SNOMED hence unless changed, the gestational age would be for the person whose record it's in. I'll bet that would still be confusing and since this is an observable - go with LOINC.</p>",

My original question was from the perspective of a pop health platform that aggregates data from disparate source systems, so we are at the mercy of how the source system codifies gestational age.  We were trying to assess whether or not the focal subject was known from the SNOMED code.  I agree LOINC is much cleaner (when LOINC is provided).  Based on your response, though, it sounds like we can assume that the SNOMED code has a focal subject of patient.  Thanks -- I appreciate the input.</p>",

But that context can potentially be overridden by how the concept is used in the information model.  If that same SNOMED concept is used in a pregnant mother's record in an observation that specifically indicates the fetus as the subject, then it would be interpreted as the gestational age of the fetus.  So, back to your original question, looking at only the SNOMED CT code itself is probably not going to be sufficient to differentiate between mom's gestational age at birth when mom was a baby vs. mom's fetus' gestational age when mom was pregnant.  There's some further information about this in the SNOMED CT Terminology Services Guide here: (<a href=\"https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCTSG/12.3.21+Normal+Forms+That+Take+Account+of+the+Information+Model\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCTSG/12.3.21+Normal+Forms+That+Take+Account+of+the+Information+Model\">https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCTSG/12.3.21+Normal+Forms+That+Take+Account+of+the+Information+Model</a>), which is written in the context of transforming SNOMED CT expressions (which includes precoordinated concepts) to normal forms.</p>",
