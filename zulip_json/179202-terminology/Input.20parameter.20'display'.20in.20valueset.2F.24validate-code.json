It has been discussed here and elsewhere that a value set only tells which concepts are its members, and doesn't say anything about what concept descriptions are included. So, may I request clarification on what concept descriptions should be searched for $validate-code with input parameter 'display', please. Is it only the display that's included in the value set or all descriptions from the code system for the matching concept? Thanks!</p>",

But do we think that designations (compose.include.concept.designation) should also be included, if they have been defined?  I would assume that would be the case.  I am also wondering about the overlap between CodeSystem and ValueSet here.  Theoretically, I assume that you could create display and designation terms in the code system and then completely override them in the value set.  That doesn't seem to me like especially desirable behavior, but maybe it is and should be allowable (and presumably would be an edge case)?  At the very least we probably need to say more about how the similar capabilities in CodeSytem and ValueSet interact (I think that's something that we neglected to do when CodeSystem was added).</p>",
