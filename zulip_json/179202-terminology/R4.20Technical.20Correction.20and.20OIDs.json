And no one else noticed at the time...</li>\n<li>which means that we published R4 with re-used OIDs for different code systems - see <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/OIDs\" title=\"#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/OIDs\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/OIDs</a> for details</li>\n<li>FMG decided to fix this as a technical correction in R4 (since we are doing one anyway) - to change the root from .1 to .4 so that there's no re-use. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am drawing vocab's attention to this change specifically. It's a very simple technical oversight with rather dramatic implications. (I am sorry)</p>",
