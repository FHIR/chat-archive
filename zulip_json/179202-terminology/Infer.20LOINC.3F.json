My understanding is that the organism is typically identified <strong>in</strong> the isolate <strong>from</strong> the specimen, so I don't know if there's a good rule for which one to use.</p>",

As for the two latter choices, I believe the difference is one of specific context. If a specimen is \"refined\" in some way, then the result could be considered an \"isolate\" versus testing the specimen directly. If you are looking for something general, I'd use \"Specimen.\"</p>",

        "content": "<p>The term \"isolate\" is normally (probably always) used in practice when we are talking about cultures - i.e. the organism (most often bacterial, but also can be viral) is specifically grown in order to assist with identification and/or provide samples from that particular organism for further testing (susceptibility or others).  So an isolate is a derived specimen (although I think that usually isn't stated).  If the organism isn't grown to obtain the specimen, then the specimen (whether derived or processed by staining, aliquoting or anything else) isn't an isolate.  PCR and other molecular microbial tests are usually done on non-cultured (therefore not \"isolate\") specimens.  So we should choose and use the specific LOINC codes (for \"Specimen\" or \"Isolate\") accordingly.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191698\">@Riki Merrick</span>?</p>",

Just not sure if there are edge cases where you might id the bug without an isolate step, and have to make up a fake isolate #.
