Obviously the output of this service has to be a FHIR resource. The solution we implement and test here today is this: <br>\nThe FHIR client uses POST ValueSet$expand with the In Parameters providing an intensional definition stating the coding system ( say LOINC), and providing a Filter [property = long common name, op = regex, value = the lexical content]<br>\nThe FHIR server returns back the expansion of this dynamic ValueSet, which contains the list of candidate concepts.<br>\nQuestion: Is this a good practice? If not, what would be a better method? Thanks!</p>",
