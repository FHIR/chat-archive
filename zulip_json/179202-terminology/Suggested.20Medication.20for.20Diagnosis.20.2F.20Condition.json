But yes, there are some good sources that you can navigate and you've found two. The newly minted update to NDF-RT is <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/MED-RT/index.html\">MED-RT</a> and you can do some of the same queries based on that data, but no simple browsers (but I may be wrong) and no API \"services\" that links medication to indication that I know of. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"195036\">@Carol Macumber</span></p>",
