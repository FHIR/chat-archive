As part of the move towards SNOMED,m the majority or Read2 codes have been mapped to SNOMED concepts, more specifically via a specific description Id.</p>\n<p>As such when we receive the data from a 3rd part it has both the Read code and SNOMED Description Id. as a precursor to us processing via SNOMED's ECL capabilities, we need to find the corresponding concept Id.</p>\n<p>We can get close to finding the concept it, but the final hurdle involves us looking up the target concept id to discover its associated synonyms.  Using the $lookup operation we can retrieve the synonyms but not the description ids.</p>\n<p>I think we have hit a brick wall and now need to stray outside of FHIR - unless I have missed something.....</p>",

My inclination for this would be to transform the SNOMED RF2 Descriptions file into a FHIR ConceptMap (and only for the subset of DescriptionIds that are referenced in the READ2 map).  Then you can do a two-step $translate to go READ2 -&gt; SCT Description -&gt; SCT Concept.<br>\nYou'll need to invent your own CodeSystem &amp; ValueSet URIs for the \"code system\" of DescriptionIds (because they are NOT part of <a href=\"http://snomed.info/sct\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://snomed.info/sct\">http://snomed.info/sct</a> as far as FHIR is concerned), but you shouldn't need (at least with Ontoserver) to create explicit CodeSystem &amp; ValueSet resources for them just to use the ConceptMap.</p>",

We have a situation whereby we receive SNOMED description ids from a source. We need to get back to the concept id so we can use ECL.<br>\n.<br>\nThere are three scenarios that we have:<br>\n1) The description id is the one published as part of the RFead2-&gt;SNOMED map. For this as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191343\">@Michael Lawley</span>  suggest we can construct a concept map to assist.<br>\n2) The description id we receive is not the one from the published map, but instead another synonym. For example, the user may now be using the preferred term rather than the \"official\" mapped term.<br>\n3) The user may send through a description id for a concept that has nothing to do with the Read2-&gt;SNOMED as their systems move to more \"native\" use of SNOMED.</p>",
