The CBBs or ZIBs as we refer to them, have a preference for SNOMED CT and LOINC bindings. In primary care however no one uses SNOMED CT/LOINC at all and only the National GP association codes are used. As per the usual these primary care codes do not have a 1-to-1 relationship to SNOMED CT/LOINC.<br>\n.<br>\nFor primary care/primary care communication it makes sense to send the appropriate GP code along with the preferred SNOMED CT/LOINC term.<br>\n.<br>\nExample: we have a PHR sending 7-point glucose results (see other discussion in implementers) using FHIR Observations from the patient to the GP. The GP codes contain pre-coordinated concepts for these results, but both SNOMED CT and LOINC do not. The FHIR Observations need conversion into Edifact MEDLAB before the GP is able to receive them at all.<br>\n.<br>\nFor interpretation of what the result is, it makes no sense to try and educate the conversion with complicated post-coordinated contextual mapping based on SNOMED CT/LOINC + Observation timing to hopefully reach the same conclusion as you would reach by just taking the GP-code.<br>\n.<br>\nIf however you would send them same glucose observation to secondary care, they would have no use for the GP code, but only for the SNOMED CT/LOINC code.</p>\n<p>Hope that covers your question?</p>",
