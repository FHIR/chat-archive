Downloading the full External Coding System OIDs Excel Report, I see \"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/</a>\" in the _description_ column but not in the _URL_ column. I also add that the terminologies-systems page has on it a note saying that the UMLS pattern may be the right choice according to one interpretation of \"Until these code systems are registered\" and \"Pending\".</p>\n<p>So should the system URI be urn:oid:&lt;yada&gt;, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/ncbi\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/ncbi\">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/ncbi</a>?</p>\n<p>Does a status of \"Pending\" alter the instruction to refer to the OID Registry or how to use the information? Does a URI found outside of its designated column count?</p>",

I guess I failed to clarify my needs, so let me try restating it differently. My question rephrased is \"What is the unambiguous ordered sequence of observations that expert members have decided one should make to fulfill the ambiguous directive phrase 'working through' at the top of <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies-systems.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies-systems.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies-systems.html</a> in relation to the given ordered list of sources one should inspect for systems that have not been validated by the terminology authority?\" Is the answer to just pick whatever I want willy nilly from the first source that satisfies finding anything anywhere inside?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you need NCBITaxon start with that one when you ask for guidance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I know that I have mentioned one specific system, but I would greatly prefer an answer that addresses the essence of the issue rather than just one example of its manifestation.</p>",
