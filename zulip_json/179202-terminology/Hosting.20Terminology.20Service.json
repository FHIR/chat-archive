You don't need a terminology service to do that and using one that is external doesn't change the need to meet IP requirements for <em>use</em>. As Lloyd noted, if you take on terminology internally, you just have to do all the needed things yourself, like maintenance, updating, and providing all functionality you require, like subsumption and expansions.</p>",
