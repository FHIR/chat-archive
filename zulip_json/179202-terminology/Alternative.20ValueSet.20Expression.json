The tricky thing about this is that the cardinality of ValueSet.compose.include is 1..*.  So if we put the expression inside compose, you can't have a compose with an expression and no include. and if we put the expression beside the compose, you can't have a value set with an expression and a locked date and no include.</p>",

In principles, the answer is that if you really want to do this, you can define a value that does the exclude, and then import it. Could be a contained value set if necessary.
