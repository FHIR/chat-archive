The use as displayed banners based on Privacy Mark Security Labels was demonstrated at HIMSS this year in the Consumer Centered Care Planning Interoperability Showcase track using the HSPC Sandbox EHR and Perspecta security labeling capabilities.  VA Demonstration area had a CUI kiosk as well.

DS4P needs to be updated to support computable CUIs as these aren't just about display to end users. CUI marked content must be protected at least to NIST 800-171, and may need additional security enforcement if the CUI authority is specified, e.g., HIPAA Security safeguards or OMB Circular A-130.  Mike Davis has been driving this work at HL7 and participating at the federal agency level.  My guess is that he'll want to see an X-paradigm IG.  Also, the FHIR narrative will need a profile with rules on how to display the CUI security label codes in required concatentation as specified in the CUI Marking Handbook Grahame cited â€¢https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/20161206-cui-marking-handbook-v1-1.pdf</p>",

But CUIs are more complex than just the rendered mark. They should also be used as security label codes so that Access Control Systems know (per policy rules) that the marked information may only be accessed/disclosed to those with clearance/need to know, that the markings must be persisted and managed, must be reapplied upon disclosure, and may need to be revised/declassified at some point.  Also, anything marked with CUI, as I noted above has specific security protection requirements, at a minimum NIST 800-171,  and if a specified CUI, additional requirements per law.  All of this was documented and discussed with the Security WG and included in the Harmonization proposals.  Also, as stated above, there's a link to thorough background on why CUIs need to be included in a standard interoperable vocabulary.</p>",
