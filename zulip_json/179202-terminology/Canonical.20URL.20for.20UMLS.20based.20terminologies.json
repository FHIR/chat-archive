It's not on <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies-systems.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies-systems.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies-systems.html</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/MED-RT\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/MED-RT\">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/MED-RT</a> resolves at NLM to <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/MED-RT/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/MED-RT/index.html\">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/MED-RT/index.html</a> from which source files and an explaination can be found. Seems like this would be the current choice and while MED-RT is distributed via UMLS, the url <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/medrt\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/medrt\">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/medrt</a> does not resolve at all. This raises an issue for RxNorm and other UMLS-based code systems which seem to have a different url approach. Bottom line is that, like so many other organizations, it seems NLM has not been approaching the use of urls with the rigor demanded by FHIR. I will try to have a discussion with NLM about this so I'll ask that we hold off on final decisions pending that discussion.</p>",
