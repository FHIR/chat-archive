One of the goals/desires that we had talked about for Baltimore is integrating terminology services more thoroughly into the other Connectathon tracks.  I should have sent this much earlier, of course, but anything that we can do even in the remaining 5 days to help that happen would be great.  I'll reach out to other track leaders, but I'll also invite the rest of you to do the same for any tracks that you are involved in or interested in.  Essentially, we would like for the other groups to be utilizing the FHIR terminology service API for their access to value sets, mappings between value sets/code systems and for terminological reasoning that they are deploying in their implementations and applications.</p>",
