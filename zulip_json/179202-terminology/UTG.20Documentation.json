The content there is insufficient and should be consumed with that in mind.</p>\n<p>Currently the UTG Jira project is focused on recording and shepherding HL7 terminology content changes through consensus review. Its use will be extended to include the workflow to record and resolve requests for changes to the supporting content on <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org\">terminology.hl7.org</a>.</p>",
