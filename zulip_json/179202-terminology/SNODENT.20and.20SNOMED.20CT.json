All SNODENT codes end in a (capitalized) letter so I suspect you are seeing the SCT concept identifier if it looks like one. Take a look at <a href=\"https://snodent.ada.org/?component=61281005\">Bloodstained sputum (finding)</a> which you will note in the url, actually uses the SCT id for the url. None-the-less, if you are identifying the concept as a SNODENT concept (as is necessary for interoperability on dental information) you need to use the SNODENT ID, in the case of the example, that would be 148994D. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"301229\">@Jean Narcisi</span> is the one in charge and she will fix any misstatements I've made.</p>",
