It used to, until the Jan 2017 release, but is now withdrawn entirely as part of SI trying to drive through the withdrawal of the antecedent versions. So, if you have a SNOMED RT identifier from historical data and you now want to work out what the equivalent SNOMED CT identifier is, this operation has now already become an extremely complex piece of archeology: even with the last published version of that refset (from within der2_sRefset_SimpleMapSnapshot_INT_20170131.txt) , you'll find that 106,341 of the 432,470 SNOMED RT IDs listed therein (24.6%) were last seen attached to a SNOMED CT conceptId that has already become inactive in today's SNOMED CT, meaning that your ability to taxonomically report on these direct 'mapped' SNOMED CT equiv codes is in fact seriously compromised, unless and until you also unravel the historical SAME_AS relationships etc etc.</p>",

But none of those R-series SNOMEDIDs appear in the final release of SNOMED RT itself that Kent Spackman gave me way back (there having never been a Chapter R, as I said...) and so they don't validate as bona fide SNOMED RT codes depending on what SNOMED RT reference you have. I note that many of them were only added very recently - long after SNOMED RT development stopped - and so I suspect they are actually ALL fake SNOMED RT identfiers that SI were in the habit of adding in order that the SNOMEDID slot in the old RF1 tables still contained a string and not a null, even though the strings being inserted were never officially SNOMED RT codes at all. Similar to all the CTV3 codes beginning XU furnished by another refset shipped as part of the same release file, none of which are legit CTV3 codes despite what the relevant refset is called.</p>",

But assuming they agreed, you would then expect it to only recognise/validate the official final set of SNOMED RT identifiers, and not also the &gt;300k pseudo-SRT identifiers - such as all those beginning with an R - that you can find populating the SNOMEDID column of Ye Olde RF1 sct1_concepts distro, or listed in the now withdrawn 900000000000498005 srefset that was, in truth, never a 'map' despite its name. </p>\n<p>The full set of 432k SNOMEDID identifiers previously listed within 900000000000498005, which have now bled over into specifications like DICOM, are clearly not exclusively IDs derived properly from SNOMED RT. Only 127,294 of them are true equivalence/mapping references to identifiers that actually do belong primarily to that external antecedent terminology (which only ever contained 132,517 different concepts) and within which those external codes also originally had a different extensional definition (parents, children, siblings in the SRT taxonomy). The huge majority of them - 305,176 - are actually true, simple, alternate concept identifiers within SNOMED CT itself and that never had any other meaning in any other scheme. </p>\n<p>Given this split, what identifiers would you expect to validate against &lt;system value=\"http://snomed.info/srt\"/&gt; ?</p>",
