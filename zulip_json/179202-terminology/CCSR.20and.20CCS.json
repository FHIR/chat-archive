Like Elixhauser (another AHRQ grouping of ICD10CM codes), CCSR is updated each year in line with the ICD10CM FY releases, but in itself does not define new codes or concepts. Given this understanding, CCSR is closer to a value set, which vocab has defined as \"specifies a set of codes drawn from one or more code systems, intended for use in a particular context.\" <br>\nBut then...what would be the best practice in FHIR's handling of taxonomies, or possibly ontologies based on existing code systems?<br>\nIs the guidance to build a value set or identify it as a code system? Code system is structurally more elegant for taxonomies, but value set seems truer to the intent.</p>",
