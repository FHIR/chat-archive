We're making codes specific to the genes tested because that's important in the early stages of this in order to be able to evaluate the situation, and the labs doing the tests will know exactly which codes to pick.<br>\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.

In addition, CMS released new fact sheets that explain Medicare, Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Program, and Individual and Small Group Market Private Insurance coverage for services to help patients prepare as well.  HCPCS is a standardized coding system that Medicare and other health insurers use to submit claims for services provided to patients. Last month, CMS developed the first HCPCS code (U0001) to bill for tests and track new cases of the virus. This code is used specifically for CDC testing laboratories to test patients for SARS-CoV-2. The second HCPCS billing code (U0002) announced today allows laboratories to bill for non-CDC laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV (COVID-19). On February 29, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a new, streamlined policy for certain laboratories to develop their own validated COVID-19 diagnostics. This second HCPCS code may be used for tests developed by these additional laboratories when submitting claims to Medicare or health insurers. CMS expects that having specific codes for these tests will encourage testing and improve tracking. <br>\nThe agency also released three fact sheets that cover diagnostic laboratory tests, immunizations and vaccines, telemedicine, drugs, and cost-sharing policies.  <a href=\"https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDEsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMDAzMDYuMTgyNzQzNzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbXMuZ292L2ZpbGVzL2RvY3VtZW50LzAzMDUyMDIwLW1lZGljYXJlLWNvdmlkLTE5LWZhY3Qtc2hlZXQucGRmIn0.-LEPz-t3FFUuihDEcT59KFtoQXvJ4HnJrZ2BgvkBvVM/br/75797412731-l\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDEsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMDAzMDYuMTgyNzQzNzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbXMuZ292L2ZpbGVzL2RvY3VtZW50LzAzMDUyMDIwLW1lZGljYXJlLWNvdmlkLTE5LWZhY3Qtc2hlZXQucGRmIn0.-LEPz-t3FFUuihDEcT59KFtoQXvJ4HnJrZ2BgvkBvVM/br/75797412731-l\">Medicare Fact Sheet Highlights</a>, <a href=\"https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDIsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMDAzMDYuMTgyNzQzNzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbXMuZ292L2ZpbGVzL2RvY3VtZW50LzAzMDUyMDIwLW1lZGljYWlkLWNvdmlkLTE5LWZhY3Qtc2hlZXQucGRmIn0.puS35kdr3fdH0q-rlIjaVuYW4i_hLkpRviowzf0QI9U/br/75797412731-l\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDIsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMDAzMDYuMTgyNzQzNzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbXMuZ292L2ZpbGVzL2RvY3VtZW50LzAzMDUyMDIwLW1lZGljYWlkLWNvdmlkLTE5LWZhY3Qtc2hlZXQucGRmIn0.puS35kdr3fdH0q-rlIjaVuYW4i_hLkpRviowzf0QI9U/br/75797412731-l\">Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Fact Sheet Highlights</a>, <a href=\"https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDMsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMDAzMDYuMTgyNzQzNzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbXMuZ292L2ZpbGVzL2RvY3VtZW50LzAzMDUyMDIwLWluZGl2aWR1YWwtc21hbGwtbWFya2V0LWNvdmlkLTE5LWZhY3Qtc2hlZXQucGRmIn0.LRjiiQdFIyAMoxHcYEIoLPbMise7xTZYseO0x6Y0WUg/br/75797412731-l\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDMsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMDAzMDYuMTgyNzQzNzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbXMuZ292L2ZpbGVzL2RvY3VtZW50LzAzMDUyMDIwLWluZGl2aWR1YWwtc21hbGwtbWFya2V0LWNvdmlkLTE5LWZhY3Qtc2hlZXQucGRmIn0.LRjiiQdFIyAMoxHcYEIoLPbMise7xTZYseO0x6Y0WUg/br/75797412731-l\">Individual and Small Group Market Insurance Coverage</a>.\"</p>",

The CPT is just saying that a molecular test used to detect SARS-CoV-2 was done, without saying which test. It shouldn't be used in clinical care other than to record that a test was done. If it's done in the doctor's office (not happening now), the CPT would be submitted to insurance by the doctor's office, along with whatever other tests were done (Flu, RSV). If it's done at a lab, the lab would submit the CPT to the insurance company, but that CPT code wouldn't wind up in the patient's primary record.</p>\n<p>'Please provide a specimen' - as far as I know there's no code for this. It might be documented in the clinical note (\"I sent Mr. A to lab X to get tested for Z\") , but it's not directly coded. However, it is captured indirectly in the form of an order either as -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An electronic order sent to the performing facility.</li>\n<li>An order written on paper - \"Please go to lab X and get a nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2\" and documented in the clinical note.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>'A specimen was provided' - again, you can get to this indirectly -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there's an electronic order, it can be tracked from order placement, specimen collection, prelim results, final results, etc. If the patient doesn't show up, you still have a record of no specimen being provided.</li>\n<li>If there's no electronic order, it can't be tracked until the patient actually goes to the performing facility. If they never show up, the performing facility will never know that there was an order or a specimen that needed to be collected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Until recently, most patients weren't documenting medical information themselves, which may be a big part of why there aren't any codes from the patient perspective.</p>",
