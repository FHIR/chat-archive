I agree that the OID for the value set (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-immunization-status.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-immunization-status.html</a>) doesn't come up when I go to the HL7 OID registry site, but I checked a few other value sets and don't find any of them.  Can anyone help me understand how the OID is assigned to a value set? Should these be in the OID registry?</p>",
