At points where FHIR has a binding to a ValueSet that does not match ours, I need a ConceptMap to instruct my implementers how to handle those.</p>\n<p>Since our Dutch IMs have versions, the ConceptMap might differ from mapping element to mapping element. I have talked to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> at some point about how to best connect the ConceptMaps to the mappings. We landed on an extension to ElementDefinition.mapping but until now I use the mapping.comment for a textual reference to the ConceptMap.</p>\n<p>Looking at R4, I see the right type of extension exists (<a href=\"https://hl7.org/fhir/extension-11179-permitted-value-conceptmap.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hl7.org/fhir/extension-11179-permitted-value-conceptmap.html\">permitted-value-conceptmap</a>), but does not appear to have the right context for ElementDefinition.mapping just yet.</p>\n<p>Do I need to file a ticket for that, or is there a different extension to turn to?</p>",
