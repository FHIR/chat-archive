The existing v3 value set for human languages (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/HumanLanguage/vs.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/HumanLanguage/vs.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/HumanLanguage/vs.html</a>) seems to take codes from ISO 3166 which seem to be country codes. This should be corrected right? The web page says the value set is not currently used, so maybe it can just go away...</p>\n<p>Can this be fixed with a FHIR Jira ticket or does some V3 authority have to fix it? Thanks</p>",
