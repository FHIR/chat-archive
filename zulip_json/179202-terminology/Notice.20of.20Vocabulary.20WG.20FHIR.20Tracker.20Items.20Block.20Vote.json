I could find a blockVote spreadsheet, but at least one of the links is an issue that's already been resolved - so it's not appropriate to be voted.  As well, the spreadsheet doesn't indicate what the dispositions are, which isn't super friendly.  Finally, you should specifically \"@\" those whose issues are being block voted so that their attention is drawn to review and make sure they're ok with the proposed dispositions.</p>",
