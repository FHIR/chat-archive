For example, if v3 used an OID, FHIR can use a meaningful URI because transformation is already a requirement at the boundary between v3 and FHIR.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>Code system URIs SHOULD be human-readable and human meaningful.

If (unfortunately) an OID is already in widespread use in FHIR implementations, that defacto becomes the mandated URI</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Code system URIs SHOULD be concise.  A URI is something that will need to be typed many thousands of times and will also appear in millions or billions of instances.  Over-long URIs impose a cost on implementers, storage and bandwidth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Code system URIs SHOULD be URLs that resolve to some useful description of the code system and SHOULD be defined such that they can be expect to reliably resolve for a long time (many decades).

However, in meeting the objective for #4, all prior priorities must be respected.  If #4 cannot be achieved in a manner that also adheres to the higher priorities, the HTA should assign a URI that adheres to the first 3 priorities and, if possible, relies on HL7 to establish the permalink that will achieve #4.</p>\n<p>In cases where a URI is already in use by the community, the HTA should confirm that the entity pointed to by the URI is in fact a single distinct code system, and having confirmed that, publish the URI already in use.</p>\n<p>If the IP usage rules of an organization preclude the use of a URI that adheres to #1, we should treat that code system in the same manner we treat code systems that do not enforce code-concept permanence.
