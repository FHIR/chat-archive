It is important to note that the resource instances returned from the /metadata endpoint are expected to represent the \"official\" declared capabilities for the server.  That may not necessarily be true for the /CapabilityStatement and /TerminologyCapabilities endpoints (particularly in general purpose servers which also provide terminology service capabilities).  Additional instances and versions of the CapabilityStatement and TerminologyCapabilities resources could be present on the server which may not reflect the declared server capabilities but which would potentially be returned by queries of those endpoints (theoretically they could even be for different servers - although I'm not sure why someone would do that).</p>",
