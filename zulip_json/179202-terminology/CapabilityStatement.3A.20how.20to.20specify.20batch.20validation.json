However, work is now underway to determine what might be in a dedicated Terminology Services Capability Statement. Until then, if you want to see a CS for an R3 Server that supports a wider range of FHIR Terminology Services, take a look at <a href=\"http://its.patientsfirst.org.nz/RestService.svc/Terminz/metadata\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://its.patientsfirst.org.nz/RestService.svc/Terminz/metadata\">http://its.patientsfirst.org.nz/RestService.svc/Terminz/metadata</a> (ignoring the Location Resource which is there for another purpose).  Although I support batch for the $validate-code and $translate operations, I don't know how to express that (for individual operations) in a CS since FhirComments were removed from CapabilityStatement Operation Components.</p>",
