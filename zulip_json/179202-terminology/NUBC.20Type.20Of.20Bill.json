We've had Field 17 -which is the \"patient discharge\" - for a long time because it's in C-CDA and elsewhere. NUBC is managed by the American Hospital Association (AHA) and they see the codes used for UB-04 as propritary and require a license to use them. NLM/ONC/VSAC has for years been working with AHA to obtain these codes and it's not happened but we've gotten closer - for that one FL-17 set. </p>\n<p>What this means is that \"publishing the system\" is against NUBC's IP restrictions. Deciding on a FHIR url is a different matter, but I think you want access to the content, correct?</p>",
