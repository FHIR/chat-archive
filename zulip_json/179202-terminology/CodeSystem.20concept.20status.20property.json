It says to use '<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties#status\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties#status\">http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties#status</a>' for the CodeSystem.concept.property.code. I can do this. But when I look at the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-concept-properties.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-concept-properties.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-concept-properties.html</a> webpage for that code system, it defines a different set of codes - it says 'inactive' as the code rather than 'status' as defined on the CodeSystem resource page (at <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem.html#status\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem.html#status\">http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem.html#status</a>). This mismatch causes confusion, though it is probably technically correct. Other property names are also different or missing (deprecationDate and retirementDate). Can they be harmonized, please. Thanks!</p>",

Additionally, deprecationDate and retirementDate need to be synced on the latter.</p>\n<p>Changes requested:</p>\n<p>1. Retire the 'inactive' code in the latter (code system-concept-properties) and replace with 'status' instead. </p>\n<p>2. Optionally, create a new code system/value set to hold the value codes for status, namely: active, experimental, deprecated, retired. Bind/reference CodeSystem.concept.property for status to this VS (as extensible - if a codesystem wants to have other concept statuses).</p>\n<p>3. Two other codes - deprecationDate and retirementDate need to be synced on the latter webpage. </p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

A code system can still have a new version, that's not forbidden just because the current version is normative. If the code system is normative in R4, does this mean it can be done in R4 or we'll have to wait until R5 of FHIR?</p>",
