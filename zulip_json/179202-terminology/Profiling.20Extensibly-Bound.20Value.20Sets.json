It so happens that none of the values in that value set fit are suitable interpretations of Karnofsky Performance Status (whose values are specified in LOINC LL4986-7). So my questions are:<br>\n1) Would it be acceptable to bind Observation.interpretation in a profile to a value set that includes non-overlapping values drawn from LL4986-7? (I expect yes, since the original binding is extensible).<br>\n2) Would it be acceptable to exclude some or all of the inapplicable codes from ObservationInterpretation value set from the value set in the profile? (I expect this would be yes, as well, because you can remove codes from value sets even when there is a required binding.)<br>\n3) If 1 and 2 are acceptable, does it follow that one can bind Observation.interpretation to an entirely different value set, under the proviso that the terms in the original and replacement value set have no overlapping meaning?</p>",
