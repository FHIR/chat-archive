There is, understandably, no LOINC code for \"time spent in poor posture\". However, there <em>are</em> SNOMED finding codes for poor posture. I imagine this is not an unusual situation, especially with wearables: I want to capture \"period/total tim spent in state X\" where X is some physiological state (in poor posture, low blood sugar, asleep etc.) for which there is a SNOMED finding code for X. One could of course define custom codes, but it seems desirable to leverage the fact that we already have a clean well-known code for X. So my question is: Is it possible to \"post-coordinate\" a SNOMED finding code for X in an Observation resource to communicate </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"total time spent in state X\" and</li>\n<li>\"period spent in state X\"??</li>\n</ol>\n<p>E.g one could image setting <code>Observation.code</code> to the SNOMED finding code and then, for case (1) using <code>Observation.valueQuantity</code> to communicate the amount of time in this state, or, for (2) to use <code>Observation.valuePeriod</code> to communicate the period in this state (with <code>Observation.effectivePeriod</code> given the total observation time/reference time). Lloyd indicated that there are mechanisms to combine observation codes and <code>components</code> to communicate such things - I would be very interested in hearing about that.</p>",

I think that would be a reasonable way to do it.  But I think what you are hoping or asking for is more about how you can use existing codes in some type of \"pattern\" within the Observation resource.  I hate to have you move the discussion again, but I think it would better to have that discussion in the <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179256-Orders-and.20Observation.20WG\">Orders and Observation WG</a> stream rather than here.</p>",
