These often contain languages other than English, but that is not how they are managed in SNOMED or in the mapping of SNOMED to FHIR.  Rather, SNOMED descriptions include a language tag, and then additional reference sets allow you to group sets of descriptions together for different contexts.<br>\nTo use different languages with SNOMED in FHIR, you use the normal FHIR language mechanisms.  The version of SNOMED only affects which languages may be in scope.</p>\n<p>A quick look at the MedDRA translation documentation (<a href=\"https://www.meddra.org/basics\" title=\"https://www.meddra.org/basics\">https://www.meddra.org/basics</a>) suggests that they are all included in a common release version, so I would expect the normal FHIR language parameters &amp; features would be used.</p>",
