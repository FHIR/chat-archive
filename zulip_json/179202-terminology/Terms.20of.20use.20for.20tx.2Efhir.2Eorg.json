However, before doing so I want to make sure I correctly understand what is considered acceptable usage so that I do not cause (or get into <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> ) trouble. It's clear that it is not guaranteed to be up and running 24-7 and should not be used for production, but I didn't find any further details on the server itself. What are the \"politeness rules\" &amp; term of use for use of this server, e.g.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In general, what are the appropriate usage scenarios for <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a>?</li>\n<li>What rate of queries from a single source is considered OK?</li>\n<li>Is the usage of this server restricted by license terms of the code systems (since it has e.g. SNOMED loaded)? Or does usage imply accepting certain license terms?</li>\n</ul>",
