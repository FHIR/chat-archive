So what you are looking at is old, and not the newest stuff.   The v2 chapter 2C from the last harmonization, released on December 6, 2017, is on the harmonization events page and can be downloaded from there.   The v2 database content was also updated, but I suspect you do not havre the latest version of that either.   So...the codes are in there, but you do not have the latest version of the material (since we do not yet have a Unified source for HL7 terminology :-)</p>",
