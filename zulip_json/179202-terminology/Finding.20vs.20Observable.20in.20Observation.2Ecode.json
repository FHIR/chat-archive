They also propose using Finding in Observation.code. Semantically I'd prefer Observable entity, so that when you combine it with a value you get a finding, and it doesn't conflict with the implicit Presence already baked into Finding. But the OE axis is immature both in content richness and in specificity, so I think I'm ok with Finding. Does this make sense?</p>",

And if we have a consistent understanding that the \"default\" context of the concept is expected (or at least allowed) to be overridden or superseded by the explicit context supplied by the information model (in this case in Observation.value) or in a compositional expression (potentially using SNOMED CT or another terminology), then I'm also not as concerned about the use of \"finding\" concepts in Observation.code.</p>",

The fact that the Situation model complicates things is unfortunate, but it's there because there is a need. <br>\nSo, #1, we agree that these symptom presence/absence questions should be Observations, not Conditions.<br>\nAnd #2, within Observation, we need a way to represent the presences and absences: an OE + presence/absence is best, but a Finding + presence/absence is feasible. And for those who may prefer a precoordinated value in code, they just don't exist. If we had the time &amp; consensus, we'd create OEs for that, but we don't.<br>\n[tangent: lab values seem to be quantifiers; clinical loinc seems to be qualifiers; the .value property has manifest semantic flexibility. We may want to assert model bindings to make these values unambiguous, but until then, the pattern supports this amount of variety.]</p>",
