Here are different use cases for the \"invalid url\":<br>\nUseCase-1: The url is NOT resolvable. Example: GET [base]/CodeSystem/$validate-code?code=399211009&amp;url=http://snomed.info/sctx (extra character 'x' at the end of url)<br>\nUseCase-2: The url is resolvable but is not a code system url. Example: GET [base]/CodeSystem/$validate-code?code=399211009&amp;url=http://snomed.info <br>\nUseCase-3: The url is resolveable and is a validate code system url but the terminology server doesn't host/support/provide such code system. Example: GET [base]/CodeSystem/$validate-code?code=399211009&amp;url=http://snomed.info/sct but server doesn't provide SNOMED-CT code system.<br>\nThe first option is to return HTTP 200 with Parameter result=false. This is aligned with other CodeSystem operations such as $lookup.<br>\nThe second option is to return HTTP 404 (or other 4xx status) since the CodeSystem result referenced by url parameter doesn't exist on terminology server. This is aligned with ValueSet.$validate-code operation.</p>\n<p>What's your opinion? Is there any other options other than the two above?</p>",
