        "content": "<p>There are LOINC display terms being used in Gravity Questionnaire instances that are eliciting warnings in the Trifolia validator. The Questionnaire is being generated by the NLM LHC tool. For code.coding.display, the LHC tool uses the LOINC Survey Question Text - if it exists (e.g., “Do you consider yourself Hispanic/Latino?” for 56051-6). If there is no Survey Question Text in LOINC (e.g., for codes that are headers in the PRAPARE survey), the LHC tool appears to use the Fully Specified Name Component for the display (e.g., “Social and emotional health” for 93040-4:). In both cases, Trifolia QA generates a warning that appears to indicate that the display should be the LOINC Long common name or the Short name (if one exists).<br>\nWarning Examples: <br>\no   The display “Do you consider yourself Hispanic/Latino?\" is not a valid display for the code {http://loinc.org}56051-6 - should be one of [\"Hispanic or Latino\", \"Hispanic or Latino\"] (from <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org/r4\">http://tx.fhir.org/r4</a>) for 'http://loinc.org#56051-6'<br>\no   The display \"Social and emotional health\" is not a valid display for the code {http://loinc.org}93040-4 - should be one of [\"Social and emotional health [PRAPARE]\",] (from <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org/r4\">http://tx.fhir.org/r4</a>) for 'http://loinc.org#93040-4'<br>\nPer the LOINC User Guide, Survey Question Text seems for be valid for display text. Is there a reason that that these display terms are not valid?</p>",

The survey question text is provided in a separate column (SURVEY_QUEST_TEXT) and it seems to be considered as something that is different from a \"display term\" by LOINC (although I'm sure you could argue that point), and the terminology server is reflecting that.  But we should almost certainly be including the survey question text, when it exists, as a separate attribute of the LOINC concept, and currently we are not doing that.  But the LOINC terminology API at <a href=\"http://fhir.loinc.org\">fhir.loinc.org</a> (which is the \"canonical\" :OINC representation in FHIR) also does not contain the survey question text and return it in a $lookup query:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>https://fhir.loinc.org/CodeSystem/$lookup?system=http://loinc.org&amp;code=56051-6\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>So this probably needs to be brought up directly with the LOINC team, as well, and likely HL7 and FHIR would follow their lead.</p>",
