Are there such rules for official lists of display texts for 5-digit codes?</p>",

My assumption was that the browser included the complete contents, but according to the manual it seems that it probably does not.  These \"supplementary classifications\" can be a real pain (I've run into this a lot in working with ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM).  So if this \"new\" interpretation based on the documentation in the manual is correct, then the issue becomes that we need to obtain a new source file for ICD-10 that is actually complete.  I have that available and I've used it for ICD-10-CM, but at the moment I don't know where else to look for it for the \"base\" ICD-10 from WHO.</p>",
