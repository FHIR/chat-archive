Which WG should approve this ticket? Can it be OO, or should it be Vocab or FHIR-I?</p>",

So it seems that what is needed is a UTG (THO) proposal to add these codes.  I don't think it's a FHIR core spec issue.  And I'm not sure what implications changing the contents to add the codes might have for V2?</p>",
