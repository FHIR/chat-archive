Many of these value sets are quite old, and date back to before THO.</p>\n<p>Now that all the CodeSystems have moved to THO, what is best practice for updating the value sets? Should they continue to use code system canonical urls of the form <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/\">hl7.org/fhir/v3/</a>..., or should they be updated? What advice should we give to our user community in terms of how they handle existing data (is <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/AcknowledgementCondition#AL</code> the same value as <code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-AcknowledgementCondition#AL</code>? Does HL7 have mappings we can point users to? (I know the mapping is trivial, but using a mapping would mean that they handle this change, the same as they handle converting from a local code to any standard terminology? What advice have other organizations given to their users? What have other organizations done internally?</p>\n<p>Alternatively, what is the downside to staying  with the old code system canonicals? The canonical won't resolve, but canonicals aren't required to. What else?</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>",

And in STU3 for those same elements you <strong>must</strong> use <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/AcknowledgementCondition</code>.  Apparently we don't have NamingSystem resources for translating these canonical identifiers in <a href=\"https://terminology.hl7.org/index.html\">THO</a>, but I think we could consider that.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191982\">@Ted Klein</span>?</p>",

        "content": "<p>I agree with your recommendations.  In addition, note that any new codes or changes to existing codes will ONLY be applied to the source of truth in THO; the older copies of v3 content in the older FHIR specs (URL based in <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/\">hl7.org/fhir/v3/</a>...) are essentially frozen past history snapshots and no longer actively maintained.    As far as the NamingSystem resources go, the update to the THO UI layout that more clearly shows the provenance and history of URLs that particular code systems have been published with in the past will be more obvious; although these are persistent in NamingSystem resources, they will be named \"Technical Identifiers\".  At this time we only have official policy for creating these for external (non-HL7) terminology resources, but I suspect we will need to extend this to the HL7 ones.</p>",
