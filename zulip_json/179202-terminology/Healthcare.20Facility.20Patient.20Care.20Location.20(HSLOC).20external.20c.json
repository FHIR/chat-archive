If we want ONLY the NamingSystem entry instead, then we need to enhance NS for some of the documentation that is missing (e.g. IP and copyright info) which is why I added the stubs initially - the information required for the generated coremif for external code systems has no home for all of it in NamingSystem.    Additionally, what about externals where we have content?  I am thinking especially about the activity underway with ADA for SNODENT right now,</p>",
