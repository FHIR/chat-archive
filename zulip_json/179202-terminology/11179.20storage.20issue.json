We have 2 extensions defined for this: <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/extension-11179-permitted-value-valueset.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/extension-11179-permitted-value-valueset.html\">http://build.fhir.org/extension-11179-permitted-value-valueset.html</a> and <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/extension-11179-permitted-value-conceptmap.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/extension-11179-permitted-value-conceptmap.html\">http://build.fhir.org/extension-11179-permitted-value-conceptmap.html</a>. I'm not sure that's an optimal set of definitions, and I've just created a task (<a href=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=17828\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=17828\">GF#17828</a>) to review them. Thought I'd alert vocab to their existence, and ask if vocab has any systematic approach here.</p>",
