Like all UTG proposals, this does not go anywhere unless someone does all the work of creating the content changes in GIT for a change in THO. Given this was an error I agree it needs to be done more quickly - but per HL7, that means a volunteer. </p>\n<p>Also, given that it seems that adr is still intended to be retired <em>for current use</em> this highlights a number of the current failings in our versioning and publishing. Technically what needs to be supported is to properly version the <a href=\"https://terminology.hl7.org/3.1.0/CodeSystem-consentscope.html\">Consent Scope code system</a> with adr in the code system as ACTIVE and that version of the code system needs to be used for the value set referenced in R4/R4B. </p>\n<p>Then, we need to have a \"newer\" version of the code system - in THO - that retires adr <strong>it should not just disappear!</strong>. Here is where I get to point out that the publisher <em>does not display code status</em> in rendering value sets, <em>and</em> a value set that is \"all codes\" in the code system will expand to include retired codes. So a value set version that uses \"latest\" version of the code system, such as those for R5/CI <em>will still show adr in the expansion</em> - it just will be retired and you will not be able to tell.<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"311999\">@Marc Duteau</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191405\">@Rob Hausam</span></p>",
