The call on the 16th will be the final call for this year.  Then we will skip the following 2 weeks (the 23rd and 30th), and the first call in January will be back on the previous alternating week schedule on January 6th.  We know that this change could cause problems for some of you, but we expect that it should solve a lot more problems than it creates, so that is the plan and the HL7 conference call calendar has been updated accordingly.</p>",
