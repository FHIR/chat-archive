Then there's the must-support part of the code set as applied to the non-must support. </p>\n<p>As things stand now we have 3 bindings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(unnamed) - the main binding which specifies what must be in an instance</li>\n<li>min binding - I think this is the must-support binding ... naming is misleading?</li>\n<li>max binding - an overloading list of codes that can be used if you have an extensible binding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Can we clarify the name as terms of those?</p>\n<p>I want to define a new binding type: A useable extensional value set for systems where we have a max value set that is intensional (we are using extensible for this, but that's confusing)</p>",
