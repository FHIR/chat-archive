What we create locks that stuff down and part of the dilemma is deciding how much is left to human interpretation of the combined model + terminology semantics. The amount of interpretation required is directly related to how tight the model is to a single interpretation. In your example <strong>if you must distinguish suspected from already confirmed</strong> conditions, then you are going to force data entry to either find model elements that differentiate among those two options (perhaps adding a condition status) or expect the terminology to carry all this information using pre or post coordination. No matter what, data entry consistency is always going to be an issue. </p>\n<p>I suggest looking at this a bit differently. I think it is improper to assume that the time-sensitive nuance of confirmed, suspected, please rule this out, resolved, is there evidence of, etc., should be encoded in a test <code>reasoncode</code>. Instead that sort of information should be found elsewhere. Either in the associated condition resource, or in clinical narratives that the interested tester can retrieve and read. <code>reasonCode</code> is a small window into why the test is ordered - a very important one - but a window that does not carry all the nuance you are asking about.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I agree with Josh on that.  What Rob M. says I think is essentially correct technically, but I'm not sure if the conclusions drawn from it are entirely warranted or practical.  The use of \"reason for order\" (coded or otherwise) is pretty much as Josh describes.   And we have to acknowledge Rob's comment about the intersection of the information and terminology models - and my take from that is that if you populate a \"reason\" element that doesn't specify the additional semantic of \"suspected\" (or whatever one is desired) with a code or expression that also doesn't specify that additional semantic, then what you are saying is that the reason for the order <strong>is</strong> the presence of the actual condition as would normally be understood by specifying that code.  It can't mean anything else, and if that's not your actual intended meaning then you shouldn't be trying to say it that way.  On the other hand, I think it's very common and very legitimate and likely quite necessary to be able to say that a \"suspected\" (or \"rule out\") condition is the reason for an order.  So, given what we've said, I think that gets us back to the place that we either (1) need to use single codes or expressions that convey this \"suspected\" or other semantic, or (2) we need specialized model elements that provide that semantic when populated with otherwise unqualified condition codes, or (3) we are then in a position where we would have to say that you can't code these kinds of reasons  at all and would have to require (somehow) that they be recorded using only free text.  If there are other viable alternatives, I must have missed them.  Of those options, I think that #1, using codes or expressions for the \"suspected\" conditions, may actually end up being the least bad choice in many or most cases.</p>",

But, I strongly disagree that the \"least bad choice\" is to create 1000's of new pre-coordinated codes for all the possible condition+status ideas that will need to be communicated. And then are you confident that everyone will <em>always</em> communicate the universally understood correct condition+status? Remember tests are used to investigate all sorts of conditions to determine all sorts of disease states and investigative states. Why force everyone to enter this level of detail? Sure if it's an available code and it currently fits, use it, but I think \"the least bad choice\" is to leave the code to communicate a condition that <em>could include the current disease status/state, but likely will not</em> and not push to add even more pre-coordinated status+condition codes that will <strong>not</strong> be reliably used anyway.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191315\">@Josh Mandel</span> I'm not saying you <em>need</em> to also reference a current condition resource, I'm just saying use it if it's there so the tester can find it to do a bit more investigating if possible.</p>",
