The problem is we ended up with a proliferation of human created profiles of the type BloodFerritinProfile, BloodCreatineLevel, BloodCreatinineLevel etc.. that enforce the pair &lt;code, unitofmeasure&gt;. There's a similar pattern on medication statement.<br>\nOne of the ideas being circulated is to use terminology to autogenerate or to validate these profiles (e.g. there's a triple &lt;\"Chloride measurement, blood\", has_unit, \"mmol/L\"&gt; that we can use too generate the profile, or to check that a blood pressure is well formed).<br>\nHas anyone done something similar or do you think this is the wrong approach (e.g. we can just use constraints instead of creating multiple profiles)</p>",
