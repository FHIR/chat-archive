As Lloyd is asking, if it turns out that the actual meaning of the code is different when it is used in the two different contexts, then that would be an argument for considering that the CCC diagnosis and intervention code sets should actually be respresented as two different code systems, rather than one.  We will need to look further at the examples to figure out if that is actually the case.  I think it makes sense to continue to discuss those aspects further in this stream (rather than moving all of the discussion on it to implementers).</p>",
