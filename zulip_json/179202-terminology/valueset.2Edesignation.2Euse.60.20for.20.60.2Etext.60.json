If, instead you want to use concept.designation for this, as Eric is requesting, it seems to me that you could do this (with or without a code for concept.designation.use).

I for one am <strong>very</strong> wary of the freedom to screw up this gives everyone. But hopefully users will understand that the <code>coding</code> this generates conveys the meaning, not the display.</p>\n<p>You and Rob found this at the end of 4.8.5 </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>Any display name for a concept provided in the value set is only used in the UI.

This means LOINC 55423-8 goes into <code>coding</code>and \"Step Count\" into <code>CodableConcept.text</code>.</p>\n<p>I do want to point out something important here: You are all talking about concept.display, which happens to be in the ValueSet.compose  section (the \"CLD\") part of the value set resource. You should not be getting the concepts to be displayed in a pick list from the compose elements, you need to be using the expansion of the value set as the members of a picklist. If you enumerate the set of concepts you want, and populate concept.display with your favorite string, then I suppose it will show up in the expansion (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span>  - right?)  as is noted in 4.8.5.  Given the requirement to list each member of the value set with a specific display, I'd encourage us to consider using a ... code system supplement... as another approach to this. I know Lloyd will say that any UI display string will always be value set specific, but to that I say, nope, and here is a good example.</p>",
