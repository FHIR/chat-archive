Multiple code systems could be utilised with equal relevance: <br>\ni) Billing code: this is reimbursed by CPT code 92134 (in the US) or MBS code 11219 (in Australia)..... <br>\nii) SNOMED CT:<br>\nCode    700070005<br>\nFully specified name    Optical coherence tomography of retina (procedure)<br>\niii) LOINC code - LP97035-7   OCT</p>\n<p>Any suggestions for how to provide the optimal implementable guidance for our IG and the developer community would be much appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,<br>\nAsh</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196943\">@Warren Oliver</span> <br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192135\">@Stephen Chu</span> <br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191368\">@Brett Esler</span> <br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197598\">@RÃ©gis Deshayes</span> <br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197102\">@Alexander Gogol</span></p>",

In many cases, such an observation does not require an explicit representation of the procedure used to create the observation, but where there are details of interest about how the diagnostic procedure was performed, the Procedure resource is used to describe the activity.</p>\n<p>Some diagnostic procedures might not have a Procedure record. The Procedure record is only necessary when there is a need to capture information about the physical intervention that was performed to capture the diagnostic information (e.g. anesthetic, incision, scope size, etc.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So you can use the Procedure resource if you need it, but you may not actually need it for a diagnostic test.  Instead, it might be appropriate and sufficient to use DiagnosticReport and associated Observations for the results (and ServiceRequest for the order).</p>",
