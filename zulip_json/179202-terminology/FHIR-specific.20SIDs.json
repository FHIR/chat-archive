However, none of these URLs are really FHIR-specific.  If you wanted to, you could easily send these URLs to identify the code system in v2.  We just went through a major exercise to shift all of our v2 and v3 code systems to a \"neutral\" URL reflecting our migration to a unified terminology maintenance process.  That's a nasty and painful process - and we're quite certain we're done with it.  However, do we want to make the same change for external code systems?  Doing so would be painful, but if we're going to make the change, doing it in R4 in parallel with the changes to the other code systems seems like the time to do it.  It would presumably mean a shift to something like <a href=\"http://terminologies.hl7.org/sid/ndc\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://terminologies.hl7.org/sid/ndc\">http://terminologies.hl7.org/sid/ndc</a>. </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191405\">@Rob Hausam</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191982\">@Ted Klein</span> ?</p>",

Putting content that's not actually \"FHIR\" in the FHIR namespace is inevitably going to confuse implementers.  And there will absolutely be those who say that they can't send \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/ndc\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/ndc\">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/ndc</a>\" in a v2 message because they're not doing FHIR.  Plus, it makes it easier for <a href=\"http://terminologies.hl7.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://terminologies.hl7.org\">terminologies.hl7.org</a> to be seen as the \"primary\" source for terminologies in HL7.  In practice, a lot of the guidance in our terminology pages should actually be maintained outside the FHIR spec because it's as applicable in CDA and v2 as it is in FHIR (though we do have some FHIR-specific guidance too).  We might want to move some of that at some point - and that'll be easier if the primary location is already FHIR independent.</p>\n<p>I won't go to the wall for this change, but I think that long term, it would be a better thing.  This is certainly the last opportunity the change could be made.  If we don't do it now, it's never going to happen.</p>",

Having these urls stay in the FHIR namespace when they're not FHIR-specific and there isn't a reason for them to be there other than deciding not to change them is workable, but, as Lloyd said, probably not the best long term.</p>",

I see that as a huge issue for terminology artifacts because the FHIR approach really does liberate terminology by making it \"always available, always resolvable.\" </p>\n<p>Given that, I'd not push to make the changes <strong>if</strong> we commit to providing a registry to resolve canonical urls for any item included in a published HL7 specification. I'm hoping UTG could eventually do that. If so, then we tell implementers that they should treat the canonical url as a \"meaningless resolvable identifier\" so don't read too much into the words included. Just like we do with OIDs. Of course humans will still want to jump to conclusions.</p>",
