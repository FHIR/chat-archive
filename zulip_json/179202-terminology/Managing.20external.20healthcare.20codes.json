We are planning to implement a validation engine and need to get a better understanding of the admin / legal issues that we'll need to address. If we need to access a terminology server that's hosted by one of the committees (for example LOINC), what steps do we need to take to be able to access their terminology server and use their codes? Do we need to get a license from these organizations in order to use their services? What type(s) of security mechanisms do they use (e.g., OAuth2). </p>\n<p>--Jim</p>",
