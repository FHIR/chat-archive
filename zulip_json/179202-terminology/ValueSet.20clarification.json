But, since ValueSet.compose.include.concept.designation uses \"concept\", it probably would be good for the wording to be consistent.  And since it's only a change in the text which does not change the meaning, I don't think it should be a problem to change even though ValueSet is normative.  Do you want to create a tracker?</p>",
