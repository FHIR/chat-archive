While it obviously makes sense that <code>id</code> and <code>meta</code> fields are missing in the expansion response, I was surprised that they did not include the <code>url</code>, <code>identifier</code>, and <code>version</code> elements from the VS itself.  I would have thought they would be considered important for documenting <em>what</em> has been expanded. Are there general guidelines/requirements for which ValueSet element are included in the the response to <code>$expand</code>, beyond what the resource itself requires?</p>",
