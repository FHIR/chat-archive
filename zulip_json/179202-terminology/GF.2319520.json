In this example I don't see a TMSY string that completely matches the SCD string (there's a case difference with 'diphenhydrAMINE'?).   It sounds like we can make the query more specific and (hopefully) match the RxNav choice.  In any particular instance you should have only SCD or SBD, I believe, so then the query could be:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>Select STR from rxnconso where RXCUI = :code and SAB = &#39;RXNORM&#39; and TTY in (&#39;SCD&#39;, &#39;SBD&#39;)\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I think that would do it?  The only question I have with that is whether it leaves out any instances - if so the query might need to be a bit more complex with a \"fallback\" case of some type.  I think that might happen with obsolete drugs as they don't follow the same patterns always as current ones, but I would have to check to be sure - and I don't know if we need to worry about the obsolete drugs in this case.</p>",

It should be true that any active concept that is a SBD is also linked to a SCD, but it will not have a SCD name as part of it's record, you'd have to follow the concept model. Also to get all concepts that represent general (some say generic) concepts for things ordered or dispensed will also need to include GPCK ( so you might also want BPCK) because of things like a \"z-pack.\" A GPCK will also be linked to the component SCDs. SO I think those two TTYs need to be added.</p>\n<p>As for why there are many concepts in rxnorm that do not have tty SBD or SCD, assuming we're not tripping on understanding the basic concept model, perhaps it's because of retired concepts, concepts that are from NDFRT, and other concepts in the files that are not current, active rxnorm concepts. I'd understand better if <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> you gave an example of the concepts that don't have SBD or SCD TTY.</p>\n<p>Ah, as for the GF ticket and what string to display, I'd say that needs to work for any TTY, not just the blessed ones we just cited because we certainly also need ingredient types (IN, BN, PIN, MIN) and likely any other TTY for other situations, so we need a display selection query that is not focused on a particular TTY for the concept.
