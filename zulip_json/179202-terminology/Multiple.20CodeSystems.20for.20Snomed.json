The second one is created with the same ID, and it is even created as version #1. I believe this might be happening because the code system's URL is the same for both releases, but I am not sure. Is there a way to upload multiple releases from snomed (or from any particular code system, for that matter)?Multiple CodeSystems for Snomed</p>",
