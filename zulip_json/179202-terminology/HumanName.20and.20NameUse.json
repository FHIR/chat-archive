I'm inclined to agree with Josh that \"it's cleaner semantically to attach it to the element.\"  IF there are technical reasons - such as the JSON serialization - why it would be more awkward to handle the extension as a child instead of a sibling, I'm happy to consider those, but to say that it's more confusing is confusing!</p>",
