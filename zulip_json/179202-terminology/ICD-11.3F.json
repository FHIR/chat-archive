But I agree that having a separate page for ICD-11 is almost certainly warranted.  The other considerations with all of that is that these updates/additions would only be in the R5 draft and the CI builds for some time - and instead what we really want to do is move all of this for external terminologies out of the FHIR spec so it can be accessed and managed separately, in the HTA pages and THO.  But we also, I think, need to direct people to those sources or truth from the FHIR spec, as that's still the habit and also a very logical place for implementers to look first when they have questions about how to use terminology(ies) in FHIR.</p>",
