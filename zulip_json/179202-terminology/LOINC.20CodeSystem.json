I'm struggling with translated properties, and I'm wondering about relatednames2/long_common_name/shortname.</p>\n<p>My current mapping: long_common_name [en-US] goes into concept.display, other language  long_common_name goes into concept.designation [type FSN]. Any shortname goes into concept.designation [type SYN]. Any relatednames2 are split by semicolon and go into concept.designation [type SYN]. These three columns are not duplicated as property.</p>\n<p>All en-US columns go into concept.property as string. All other language columns also go into concept.property and I've added the language to the property [currently as an extra element since it doesn't get exposed].

Would it make sense to have an optional language on concept.property in the core?</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191375\">@Alexander Henket</span> I think your mapping looks pretty reasonable.  The \"Using LOINC with FHIR\" page (<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/loinc.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/loinc.html\">http://build.fhir.org/loinc.html</a>) gives options of either SHORTNAME or LONG_COMMON_NAME for display, but I agree with your choice.  I don't think that the SNOMED CT codes in the current designation-use value set really fit well for LOINC.  The LONG_COMMON_NAME isn't really the same idea as a \"Fully specified name\", so I'm not sure if I would use it for that.  I think I would probably use \"Synonym\" for all of the designations - or maybe consider extending the value set with LOINC-specific codes?  I guess I've not really looked at non-English columns (and I'm not even sure where to get them).  Possibly an optional core property.language element would make sense (assuming that it's in the 80%).</p>",
