        "content": "<p>I am currently working with UMLS  (Unified Medical Language System). This comprises a big collection of concepts of many different code systems (about 200 code systems), see here: <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/index.html\">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/index.html</a> for a list.</p>\n<p>I need URLs for all of these code systems. Few of the code systems are already listed here: <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies-systems.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies-systems.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies-systems.html</a><br>\nbut <em>most</em> of them are not. For example, \"Multum MediSource Lexicon\" is a code system contained in UMLS and has the abbreviation \"MMSL\" in the UMLS content. Using this, <strong>MMSL|4862</strong> is a coding for \"Ibuprofen\".</p>\n<p>Since it is not realistic to get URLs for all of these 200 code systems from the respective content owners, it would be great if FHIR could set URLs for these systems. Since FHIR already has defined   <br>\n<strong>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm</strong><br>\nfor RxNorm, which is also contained in UMLS, I think it would be very nice to have the similar URLs for all the other code systems contained in UMLS like the following<br>\n<strong>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/&lt;SAB&gt; </strong><br>\nwhere <strong>&lt;SAB&gt;</strong> is the abbreviation of the code system as provided by UMLS. The above example for \"Multum MediSource Lexicon\" would then be <br>\n<strong>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/mmsl</strong><br>\n(in small letters to be consistent with rxnorm). <br>\nWould you agree to this proposal?</p>",
