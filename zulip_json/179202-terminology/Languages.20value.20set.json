Your shorter \"practical\" list is to my understanding a one-time guess at languages in play for HL7 affiliates. This list is to be used across all jurisdictions and the list I presented is known to be of use. Your suggested approach means that in implemented systems when a patient needs to document a needed language, they will not be able to because no system will ever support, nor expect a clinician to craft the correct representation for a missing language on the fly. This results in incomplete, perhaps dangerous, lack of data in the record. What makes you think that HL7 affiliates define the breadth of useful languages? Isn't it possible that it would be the rare languages that might be most problematic for patient care and demonstrate a need for capturing that information?</p>\n<p>What is the problem with taking a known, vetted list and using that instead of your 'HL7 defines the sum of need' list?</p>",
