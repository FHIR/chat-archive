        "content": "<p>\"what's a lateralisable body structure\" - very very good question.  It's not documented anywhere.  At one point I took it to mean any body structure (and its descendants) that appeared with a laterality relationship in the distribution, which is at least minimally correct.  Now I just allow and body structure because otherwise all you can do is reject the expression as malformed and that's not usually useful.  There are some cases where a concept is modelled with two sites where only one is lateralisable and thus to apply to to both is technically wrong, but again, without knowledge from the terminology of what is lateralisable there's not a lot of options.</p>\n<p>Yes, it's just a special rule.  There are others, also, earlier in that first section about merging role groups.  They have the same \"draft guidance\" rider and are probably safer to skip.  However, it's still worthwhile knowing about them.\\</p>\n<p>It's an area I've tried to get clarified but there are so few people with knowledge of this detail and (until now) tools that are impacted, that I've gotten very little traction.</p>",
