Interestingly, the mapping exercise reveals there are similar concepts in both branches, e.g., 404218003 Ampule – unit of product usage (qualifier value) and 469844003 Ampule (physical object). With a focus on interoperability, we are interested in learning what strategy others have applied or what strategy should be applied here when the value set conformance is example and, arguably, multiple hierarchies could be used.<br>\nMary Dobbins<br>\nTerminology Management, Mayo Clinic</p>",

Rob's comment makes a lot of sense, but it would imply a much broader revision of the SNOMED content model [and therefore more time/iterations] (e.g. not all units of usage are physical objects, most medicinal products are physical objects, some devices contain substances as active ingredients, some units of usage are actually devices, etc.)  I am an absolute FHIR beginner, so my personal opinion is entirely SNOMED-centric and might not be relevant to Mary's original question.</p>",
