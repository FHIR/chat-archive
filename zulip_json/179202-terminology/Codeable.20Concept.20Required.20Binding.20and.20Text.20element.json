For example, in PDEX Plan Net, specialty is a codeableConcept bound as required to Individual and Group Specialities.  However if you got an instance where the sender only sends specialty.text as anything, it would be valid.  Is that the intent?  i.e. would they have to profile the coding to be required to insure they always get a specialty code?</p>",
