The main issue we are dealing with is the FHIR server has size limit on its storage which limits the size of the resources that can be persisted, so, I don't think that patching to a larger size would work.  Not sure how the \"unmapped\" work work in this case.  I think we will have to partition into subsets and work with those.  Thanks again.</p>",
