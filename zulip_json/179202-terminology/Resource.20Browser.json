There is e.g. <a href=\"https://snomedbrowser.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://snomedbrowser.com/\">https://snomedbrowser.com/</a> for Snomed CT, and I'm now looking for something similar as a first starting point to see which resource definitions exist already and which may need to be added as own extensions. Thanks!</p>",

But, as it says, these profiles are use case specific and might differ slightly between different scenarios. An example from nursing: For a nursing summary some information might not be so important, e.g. who exactly entered the different nursing problems. For the documentation on the other hand, this information is important.<br>\nPublished resources can be found on <a href=\"https://registry.fhir.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://registry.fhir.org\">https://registry.fhir.org</a>, published implementation guides on <a href=\"https://registry.fhir.org/guides\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://registry.fhir.org/guides\">https://registry.fhir.org/guides</a>.</p>\n<p>By the way: HL7 Deutschland is working on an implementation guide for \"Deutsche Basisprofile\": <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/guide/basisprofil-de-r4/home\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://simplifier.net/guide/basisprofil-de-r4/home\">https://simplifier.net/guide/basisprofil-de-r4/home</a>.
