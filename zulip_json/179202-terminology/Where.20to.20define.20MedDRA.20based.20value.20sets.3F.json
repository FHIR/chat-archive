I can't define them in VSAC since VSAC doesn't have MedDRA as a code system (makes sense since it's not free).  I also can't determine if I can define them in THO (via UTG) since MedDRA wouldn't be available there either.  All of the FHIR value sets appear to take from FHIR code systems, so I can't see any examples of THO value sets that take from an external code system that wouldn't be defined in THO itself.  Is this possible?</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192166\">@Jean Duteau</span>  We just discussed this on the UTG call (Marc can probably fill in further details).  The main issue to guide whether it's better to have the value set published in THO rather than in the IG is, obviously, if others need to have or can make use of having access to the value set.  If there is no content available in the code system or value set, then that becomes a considerably less compelling proposition for someone else to want to/need to use it.  So, if you know of specific requests or needs (either current or anticipated) for others to be using the same value set (i.e. the same canonical url) then it's clearly best to go ahead and submit the UTG ticket and have it added there - even if the content isn't currently available (I think we agreed on the call that it is possible to do that with the current publishing process).  Otherwise, I think it's up to you which way you prefer to do it (unless and until the situation with the code system content availability changes).  That's my take.</p>",

This means you would make the value set in as complete a way possible (defining all the elements and use whatever \"Compose\" methods are appropriate (FHIR filters or RulesText for text-based definition) to define the content, but no content would be in the expansion. I suggest you do this in your own IG but I do think we should be able to accommodate this at THO via UTG. Let us know if you want to do this.</li>\n<li>Work with HTA/TSMG to see if we can work with ICH to get the code system into THO.
