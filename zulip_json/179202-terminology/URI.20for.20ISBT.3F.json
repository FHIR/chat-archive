Here is what ISBT 128 codes are for:<br>\nISBT 128 is a global standard for the identification, labeling, and information transfer of medical products of human origin (including blood, cells, tissues, milk, and organ products) across international borders and disparate health care systems.</p>\n<p>I am fairly confident that there isn't a URI already defined for this.  So what is the right way to reference ISBT product codes?  Do I create my own code system and give it a URI?  I looked at the HTA confluence and don't see a process for someone to request a new code system be considered for inclusion.</p>",

Also, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192166\">@Jean Duteau</span> since so many of the code systems that you are asking about fall in my domain of expertise, it would be really helpful if you could contact me directly - Thanks!</p>",
