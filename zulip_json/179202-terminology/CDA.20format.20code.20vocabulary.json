This formatCodes value set appears to fall under the FHIR ballot-bound content, which we've documented here: <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/VMAH/Ballot-Bound+Terminology+Content\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/VMAH/Ballot-Bound+Terminology+Content</a> . More specifically, these are the lists of ballot-bound FHIR value sets and this one is on the list: <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/valueset-formatcodes.html\">http://build.fhir.org/valueset-formatcodes.html</a> . It seems we need to do some brainstorming on how to make it easier to know where to access certain content and how it is maintained. <br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191982\">@Ted Klein</span></p>",

We will always have certain vocabulary that may be rendered in THO but is not maintained through UTG, but through ballot or other processes.    We need to address this for the community, but again it is a matter of gathering the lists in a machine readable form and developing some Jira programming to make it happen.   Take a number, here you have number 358...now calling number 7.    And if we continue to just keep throwing stuff over the wall to the nascent terminology governance group which does not appear to be moving towards formation with any degree of alacrity, that will ensure we will all be long retired before it gets done.   I don't know if <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191503\">@Robert McClure</span> is keeping a list of things tossed there in the past few months or not; I have no such list.</p>",
