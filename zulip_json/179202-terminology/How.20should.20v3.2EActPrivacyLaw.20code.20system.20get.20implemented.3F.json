My answer isn't so helpful unfortunately.<br>\nRE 1 - <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/v3/ActUSPrivacyLaw/vs.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/v3/ActUSPrivacyLaw/vs.html</a> was deprecated some time ago because I was able to get the harmonization group to agree not to isolate the US realm privacy laws outside of the main branch in ActCode under ActPolicyType.  So the same codes are now under ValueSet: ActPolicyType @ _ActUSPrivacyLaw in <a href=\"https://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet-v3-ActPolicyType.html\">https://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet-v3-ActPolicyType.html</a><br>\nRE 2 I've got a ticket to clean up this value set so into its discrete value sets but don't know what's happened with it.  Hard to get anything through UTG process. I'll check it again.  Think you can create your own value sets as subsets of current THO valuesets, but not sure how.  I need to go back through my THO tickets and issues needing to be addressed.  K</p>",

Developers are asking me if they should write code to include a codesystem where all the values are deprecated. My question is if the codesystem does not have any \"active\" values, shouldn't the codesystem get deprecated?</p>",
