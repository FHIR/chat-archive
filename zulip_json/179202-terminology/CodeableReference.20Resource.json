I apologize if my question seemed negative or confrontational (eliciting a \"problem\" posture check).  What I aimed to do was locate who among my Vocab WG colleagues I might press into providing additional information.  I see <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191405\">@Rob Hausam</span> has responded, does your question indicate that also applies to you <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192587\">@David Pyke</span> ?</p>",
