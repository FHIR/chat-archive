        "content": "<p>You can use the LOINC Answer Lists without the associated SNOMED CT mappings (even if they are there) as standalone valuesets. There are quite a few variants on Pos/Neg in LOINC answer lists: Pos/Neg/{Equivocal|Inconclusive|Indeterminate|Invalid|Undetermined} but I don't see Unknown. Probably b/c LOINC has a separate policy that says users can add a null flavor to any LOINC answer list (b/c we don't want to proliferate them based on whether they are there in the list or not). </p>\n<p>P.S. You might be pleased to know that you can get all the LOINC Answer Lists as FHIR ValueSets. E.g. <a href=\"https://fhir.loinc.org/ValueSet/?url=http://loinc.org/vs/LL360-9\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://fhir.loinc.org/ValueSet/?url=http://loinc.org/vs/LL360-9\">https://fhir.loinc.org/ValueSet/?url=http://loinc.org/vs/LL360-9</a>. Read more here: <a href=\"https://loinc.org/fhir\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://loinc.org/fhir\">https://loinc.org/fhir</a></p>\n<p>However, I see that there's a problem with some of the ValueSet expansions that have redundant LA codes listed. Will see if we can get that fixed.</p>",
