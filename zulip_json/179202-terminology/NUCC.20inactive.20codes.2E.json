I'm pretty sure that updated code system resource did not include the inactive concepts, although it certainly could have and perhaps should at some point because including inactive concepts in a code system is a fine thing to do. Perhaps Graham can tell us where the updated code system is.</p>\n<p>As for including inactive codes in a value set, again, it certainly can happen. We do it all the time when the value set is used for queries to identify patient populations where older data may have inactive concepts. Think quality measures. As for the example cited - maybe there is a reason they need to be there - <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191401\">@Eric Haas</span> , who defined the value set?</p>",
