That is why any ICD-11 concept has a \"entity\" identifier of the structure <a href=\"http://id.who.int/icd/entity/xxx\">http://id.who.int/icd/entity/xxx</a>. The MMS is a subset focused on the primary use case for ICD - Morbidity and Mortality. If you want all ICD-11 Vaccines you should be able to construct a FHIR compose starting at <a href=\"https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f164949870\">http://id.who.int/icd/entity/164949870</a>.

In so far as there is a map between (a subset of) Foundation codes and MMS codes, then I think you could find all MMS vaccine codes by getting the descendants of <code>http://id.who.int/icd/entity/164949870</code> then finding all the corresponding MMS codes via said map.<br>\nHowever, there's no direct way to do this in a ValueSet definition, or even with the FHIR <code>$translate</code> operation, since it only works on sngle codes.</p>",
