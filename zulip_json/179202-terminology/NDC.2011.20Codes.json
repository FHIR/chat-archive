The issue, of course, is that the official published NDC codes are 10 digit (with dashes in 3 different arrangements), but what most (or probably all) drug database vendors and many others use for practical reasons is the unofficial normalized 11-digit format (without dashes).  The documentation for RxNorm <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/docs/2012/rxnorm_doco_full_2012-1.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/docs/2012/rxnorm_doco_full_2012-1.html\">here</a> in <em>6.0 Normalizing NDC codes in RxNorm</em> describes this.  I think it also may help provide the solution, as I believe we can potentially use the non-proprietary RxNorm distribution of \"normalized NDC codes\" as the source for a FHIR \"11 digit NDC\" code system (if it's considered separate from RxNorm proper) and value set.  We would need to figure out how this is published and made accessible.  That's my take on it at this point.</p>",

If we can be very clear regarding what we exactly want distributed, perhaps we could get NLM to host this for us within VSAC as a value set. I understand it is a code system so perhaps we could also get this into UMLS but I suspect not, since they - correctly - see this as addition information provided with RxNorm (so it's already there.

In the past, when we've run into this sort of situation we occasionally decide this is an HL7 code system because we are taking data obtained elsewhere and crafting our specific view of it. Then we are responsible for keeping it up to date. I don't think NLM will publish it as a code system, it's linked content to rxnorm.  But perhaps we can get them (me) to publish it as a value set, and then we use the value set to update our republishing of the content as a code system.

Sequestering such material at least provides the information so we can periodically check to see if it is still current and OK  Therefore I would suggest that we have such an external 'stub' for the external code system, and import the codes that are needed, much as we have done in the case of the Dental content in V3.

In FHIR R4, which was released shortly after our previous discussion, we now have code system supplements.  But, according to our rules a supplement can't define any new codes, so that won't work for what we are wanting to do here.  It seems that under the present (normative) rules we must create a new url and code system (that is not a supplement) if we want to use these codes in Coding.code (which we do).

The <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-25045\">tracker</a> was looked at again on Jan. 23 and flagged at that time for review by HTA, but I haven't heard anything subsequently.  So the main question now is, I think, can we go ahead and create and publish this as a code system using <code>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/ndc-11</code> as the system url?  Or is there an alternative plan?  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"235766\">@Julie James</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"195036\">@Carol Macumber</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191333\">@Reuben Daniels</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191982\">@Ted Klein</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191503\">@Robert McClure</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"238597\">@Frank McKinney</span> (I've likely left out some others who could or should be tagged, but this should be a good start)</p>",

We came up with a different solution to support the NDC 10 and 11 digit codes using a new <code>code-type</code> property.  Grahame has completed the additional implmentation for that on <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a>.  Here's an example: <code>http://tx.fhir.org/r4/CodeSystem/$lookup?system=http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/ndc&amp;code=00409371801</code>.  You should now be able to create value sets that contain only 11-digit or 10-digit codes, using the <code>code-type</code> property.  The NDC content on <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a> is currently out of date, but I'm hoping to update that today.</p>",
