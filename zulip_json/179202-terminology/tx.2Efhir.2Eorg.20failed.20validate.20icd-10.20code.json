Right now, as noted ealier in the thread, <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a> does now have support for the full 1CD-10-CM code system.  But it has only quite limited support for the WHO ICD-10 content, and there hasn't been a clear need and priority noted for adding that previously.  I understand that there is a convertor tool available which reads the available ClaML distribution file that we should be able to use to make this available.  Right now it is possible to validate the <code>P02.1</code> code with ICD-10-CM on <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a>: <code>http://tx.fhir.org/r4/CodeSystem/$lookup?system=http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm&amp;code=P02.1</code>.
