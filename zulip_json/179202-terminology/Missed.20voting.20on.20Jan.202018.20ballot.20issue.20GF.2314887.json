I had intended for it to be included and voted on the Thursday (Aug. 2) call, but it didn't get in the list on Confluence and we missed looking at it.  It was recently discussed on the July 16 FHIR Tracker Issues call and set to Persuasive with Mod with the current resolution text.  Process-wise I'm not sure how we need/prefer to handle this one remaining open ballot tracker for the Vocab WG, as this proposes a substantive change and since the freeze is tomorrow we have no further opportunities to vote prior to that.  Suggestions are welcome.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191982\">@Ted Klein</span></p>",
