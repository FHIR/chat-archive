Logically-defined value sets, combined with the value set author’s guidance, can incorporate future changes as terminologies evolve to add or remove concepts, increasing efficiency and accuracy of value set creation and maintenance.</p>\n<p>An example of a rule-based value set could be: include all codes that are descendantsOf the SNOMED CT® code for ‘Clinical finding’, exclude all codes that are descendantOrSelfOf of ‘Wound finding’.</p>\n<p>This first deployment of VSAC Intensional Functionality provides support for hierarchy functions for several terminologies. Later in 2019 we will add intensional functionality for more terminologies, including RxNorm and LOINC®.</p>\n<p>You can learn more in our VSAC Support Center: <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/vsac/support/authorguidelines/createvs.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/vsac/support/authorguidelines/createvs.html\">Create an Intensional Value Set</a></p>\n<p>You can contribute to the improvement of this application by sending feedback and ideas to the <a href=\"https://support.nlm.nih.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://support.nlm.nih.gov/\">NLM Support Center</a>. We especially would love to hear from you about specific intensional value sets you want to be able to create in VSAC in the future using RxNorm or LOINC.</p>",

The VSAC FHIR API currently only works against published value sets, and as of today (2018-12-31) there are no expression-based (\"intensional\") value sets published. While in testing mode the FHIR API did not run against the sandbox and I forgot to ask about this. But tomorrow, we'll have one published (I assume) since I just published one.
