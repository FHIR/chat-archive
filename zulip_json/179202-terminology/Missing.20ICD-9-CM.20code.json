And the problem (again) is that we don't have a good source for the complete code system - especially most of the leaf codes, which are the most important (i.e. billable) and aren't explicitly enumerated in the source files from CMS/NCHS (and would otherwise require writing quite non-trivial code to parse and extract or purchasing it from a commercial source).</p>",
