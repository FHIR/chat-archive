The purpose of this is to determine if this value is actually necessary or merely replicates information that could be placed in the identifier attribute of the relevant Code System resource. In NZ, we are using this kind of NamingSystem resource as an easy means of translating Code System OIDs used in CDA documents to URIs for FHIR - and it's also a lightweight means of providing basic details of NZ-specific code systems with URIs that are resolvable to Web Page descriptions.</p>",
