The include.concept seems to allow for only complete equality and the include.filter  only allow operators on Properties or Relationships. I could create a code system filter but this seems to only allow for a human readable string in the Value element so is not computable. Filtering using an operator on elements of Concept would seem very useful. Am I missing something?<br>\nThanks</p>",
