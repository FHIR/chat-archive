It would be validating against the set of codes that would have been members of this value set (based on the specified value set definition) as of that date.  There's also another wrinkle in this which I've just started to think about.  In the case where the value set definition itself changed between the date specified in the parameter and the current time (this is assuming that it is the same value set - i.e as identified by the specified canonical url) what should be the validation behavior?  Should the server perform the validation using the earlier definition which would have been in effect on that date (if known and available, and if that's not the case return an error)?  Or should it use the current definition and validate based on what would have been available in the value set if the current definition had been used with the terminology content that was known to be available on the specified date?  Which of those assumptions and behaviors would be the most useful when I'm asking the server this question now?</p>",
