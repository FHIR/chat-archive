In DSTU2 there was this really sweet way to define the URI so I bunched all the codes into a single codesystem.  It was part of Valueset back then.   Its  there after all and so no need to use US Core.   I thought Rob M was  overstating things a bit  by describing it as a  \"a non-implementable spec\" since I had not heard a lot a grumbling about the missing code system ... until now. </p>\n<p>At the time we added these categories because they were not there in the base resource and they were defined in the MU regs.  We spent a <em>lot of time</em> on this topic and came up with a couple of codes.  I don't wish to revisit the definitions unless the implementers of argonaut want to.    I remember that  the code system resource underwent so major changes so that  we had to split these codes up into separate codesystems and subsequent to USCore  one of them got added to core spec and so there is overlap there.
