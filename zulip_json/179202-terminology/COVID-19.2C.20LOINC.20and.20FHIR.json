We discussed a few options that might work for hosting on the Regenstrief FHIR endpoint (<a href=\"http://fhir.loinc.org\" title=\"http://fhir.loinc.org\">fhir.loinc.org</a>) as well as other distribution.  I expect that they'll be making a decision on it soon.  Possibly what they will do is go ahead and add them to the LOINC code system, but with a new \"SPECIAL USE\" status value (that's one option).</p>",
