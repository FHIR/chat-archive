We also have <a href=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=19307\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=19307\">GF#19307</a> to vote on again (as noted above).  So we're going to need to plan to vote on the FHIR Tracker Issues call on Monday (which I will set up shortly).  We will obviously need to have quorum on the call, and it should be according to our Main call quorum rules, so please join the call on Monday at 5:00 PM Eastern, if possible.</p>",
