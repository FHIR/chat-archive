I think the two bullet points you've stated was the intent of ExpansionProfile.codeSystem.include . So, to your use case, I'm not sure you can restrict to a specific (version non-specific) edition only, you would need to specify a version of that edition – but that is  assuming that SNOMED CT Edition URI is not a valid version string for SNOMED CT (ML can comment if it is).</p>",
