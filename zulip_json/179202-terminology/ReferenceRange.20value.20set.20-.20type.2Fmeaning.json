Is there no 'critical' type?  (Technically, the reference range would be described as 'non-critical', as only the values outside of the range are considered critical).  Perhaps I am not looking in the right place, but I feel critical (aka panic) ranges are both common and  needed.<br>\n2. The online specification for the value set (Release 3 STU) states that 'normal' refers to 95th percentile--probably not technically correct, as it spans from 2.5th percentile to 97.5th percentile, which spans 95% of values.  <br>\n3. Other percentiles - for whatever reason, the literature (eg Fourth Definition of Myocardial Infarction) frequently uses 99th percentile for troponin I's upper limit of normal.  And the EMRs I use seem to use that as the main reference range (as opposed to 97.5 percentile) for this lab.  I'm not suggesting a new code for this range, but maybe the definition on the value set's FHIR web page can add a little wiggle room.  (Alternatively, this could be grouped under 'recommended' type like we do with lipids, I suppose).</p>",

My take is that definition of normal is too tight, and I agree that some kind of panic / critical code is commonly encountered in lab reports</p>",
