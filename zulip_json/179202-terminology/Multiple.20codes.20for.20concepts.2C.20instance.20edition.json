If so then I agree with Lloyd, you can put all three in that example into one codableconcept. You'll need to define a code system for each and keep in mind that these are all external code systems so if a standards IG you need to get HTA to represent the metadata. And we'll need to clarify the IP for NCPDP. I'd guess HIPAA is actually VA-HIPPA?</p>",
