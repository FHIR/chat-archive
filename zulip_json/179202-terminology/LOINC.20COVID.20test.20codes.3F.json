I think I can probably work around this for now by massaging the LOINC source data, and I need to find a few minutes (or hours, maybe) to try that out.  If we can get that done then we can deal with getting the importer code fixed later (at least by the time of the next release).  I haven't tried that approach yet, but it seems likely doable and I'll see if I can make headway with it hopefully later today.</p>",
