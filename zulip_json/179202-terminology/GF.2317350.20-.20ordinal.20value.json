One consequence of this change was to mean a change to the definition, which had previously said that ordinal values could only be defined in code systems.  We have lots of uses of ordinal values that are context specific - so I changed the definition to say that the value has to be defined in context (see <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/extension-iso21090-ordinal-value.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/extension-iso21090-ordinal-value.html\">build.fhir.org/extension-iso21090-ordinal-value.html</a>)</p>",
