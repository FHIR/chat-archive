Obviously this is a big deal with implications, but it's a fact, as we see here. So we need a defined process to manage this and I'd except this is something HTA, with our help, will craft as the responsible entity in HL7 for external code systems. I'd like better clarity on how we technically help folks go through a transition like we see here. For now, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191401\">@Eric Haas</span> seems to describe the result of this process.</li>\n</ol>",
