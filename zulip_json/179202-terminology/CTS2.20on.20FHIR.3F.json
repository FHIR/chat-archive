The Terminology Knowledge Architecture (Tinkar) described in the Standardized Terminology Knowledgebase Informative Document (planned to be balloted in May), in contrast, provides that every new assertion, whether a new component or a change to an existing component, must have a precise version coordinate that govern granular change control. CTS2 asserts a specific terminology model, and does not support unanticipated properties with a self-describing model.
