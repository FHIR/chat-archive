Apologies for sending a late notice, but we have changed the day and time of what were previously the every other week Thursday FHIR Tracker Issues calls to <strong>Wednesday</strong> at <strong>4:00 PM</strong> Eastern (90 minutes) - beginning <strong>tomorrow</strong>!  This means that we now have <strong>weekly</strong> Wednesday 4:00 PM FHIR Tracker Issues calls.  This will be more convenient for some of us (including some Australians), and hopefully it should for most of us be easier to remember and maybe to manage since the calls will be the same every week.</p>\n<p>Again, we will be having the FHIR Tracker Issues call <strong>tomorrow</strong>, Wednesday July 28 at 4:00 PM Eastern!
