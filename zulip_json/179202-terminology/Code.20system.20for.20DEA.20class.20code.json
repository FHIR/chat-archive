There is a difference between a \"code system\" which is a <strong>*managed collection of Concept Representations</strong> and \"a set of things that someone has put in a document\" - no matter how official that document.  It looks to me as if the DEA list is the latter.  Most countries have something similar, and usually an organisation for whom this is important takes responsibility to make the official government \"set of things\" <strong>into </strong>a code system that they properly manage; so this might be a pharmacist organisation like AHFS/ASHSP or a terminology organisation like RxNorm/NLM.  It's usually not the government organisation that authors the document though, because it's not usually in their mindset.  But it would be nice if it was.  So, who in the US can or is doing this?  What about NCPDP as another possibility?</p>",
