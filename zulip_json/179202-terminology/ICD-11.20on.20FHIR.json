I received an inquiry about it from Gwen Smith at NHS Digitial in the UK and am passing that on for her here.  They are starting to look at integrating ICD-11 within their terminology server environment and are wondering if HL7 and WHO are talking about potential support for ICD-11 in FHIR.  I'm not aware of anything that has happened with that yet (but that doesn't necessarily mean that it hasn't).  Currently there is a brief mention on the <em>Using ICD-[X] Codes with FHIR</em> page of the future release of ICD-11, but nothing else.</p>",
