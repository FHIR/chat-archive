Where xxx is the particular varient  defined. In the USA there are two - ICD-10-CM, and ICD-10-PCS. In Canada it is ICD-10-CA,  In Germany it is ICD-10-GM, etc. Until the USA CMS decides to take ownership of the ICD url for FHIR (and beyond?) it makes sense that HL7/FHIR provide it. This does raise the issue that these urls can change over time when the \"owner/authority\" decides to take over hosting. I think we've already had that occur for something.</p>",
