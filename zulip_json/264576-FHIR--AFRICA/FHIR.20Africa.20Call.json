The session is titled: ”How FHIR can help scale implementation” (see: <a href=\"https://ohie21.sched.com/event/lglI/how-fhir-can-help-scale-implementation?iframe=no\">https://ohie21.sched.com/event/lglI/how-fhir-can-help-scale-implementation?iframe=no</a>). Apologies to members of the group from Eastern time zones. Unfortunately, this is the earliest time that was available to us.  The moderators are myself, Daniel Futerman and Derek Ritz. The purpose of the meeting is to engage the community and build interest in the topic. For those who can participate, there is no need for presentations but we should have questions prepared to stimulate discussion. I suggest that we begin with a brief description of the FHIR Africa community, what it is and what we hope to achieve as well as some of the goals we have spoken of, eg building capacity and infrastructure to promote the adoption and use of FHIR in an African context; a possible FHIR Africa core etc. Please send any ideas to the list. I suggest we also use the group meeting on 4 Oct to agree further question. Thanks!</p>",
