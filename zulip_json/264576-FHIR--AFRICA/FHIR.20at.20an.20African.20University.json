(Universities of course being one of activities that builds trust and credibility). In Mark's words...\"In my experience having domain experts work with students in my Georgia Tech course created interest and recognition of what FHIR can do. I created a course similar to the one at Georgia Tech at the University of Queensland and was able to obtain permission for them to use my MOOC lectures in it. CSIRO is providing the FHIR platform. The issue would be having a platform for student projects in Africa but there must be a way to do that.\"</p>",

Let's see if there is interest.</p>",
