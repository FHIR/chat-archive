It would be great if you could share some of the things CSIRO Ontoserver is doing on FHIR Resources regarding OpenMRS. At Sovereignty we are now beginning implementation in Rwanda, that includes OpenMRS of course, and for sure many folk on this channel are going to be interested in what you are doing. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"364906\">@Chris Seebregts</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"308467\">@Olivier Karasira</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span></p>",
