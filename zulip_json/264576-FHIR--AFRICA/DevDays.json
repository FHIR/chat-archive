I wonder whether there could office hours kind follow up for every speaker? Something to think about</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the group found the Africa panel interesting and informative, but we would like any further panel to be more focused on technical/community development rather than policy level</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>we discussed holding a followup meeting for Africa, and tossed around some ideas for what it could look like.
