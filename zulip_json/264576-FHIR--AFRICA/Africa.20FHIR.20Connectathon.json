Thanks to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> for leading it. First off, I could sense some building momentum compared to the first call in December, which is very encouraging.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thanks to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"335762\">@Daniel Futerman</span> for your excellent insights and support regarding OpenHIE. Grahame may also be able to get some folk at WHO interested in supporting. </li>\n<li><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"364906\">@Chris Seebregts</span> explained his COP-like draft for a potential Connectathon (see above link to the DRAFT document). Grahame may be able to get some HL7 resources for that, but it is not his area but he can ask. </li>\n<li>Grahame made an important point. \"Whatever is done at a Connectathon must mesh with an end point people want to achieve\". (Not just be a coding event). </li>\n<li>Something that we are doing at Sovereignty in terms of real world implementation in Rwanda for Maternity Health and Child Health delivered by Community Health Workers, with fully FHIR and SHOMED CT compliant workflows was confirmed as something that would fit the above definition of a useful practical application. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"364852\">@Emeka Chukwu</span> Thx for your interest in this. Please don't hesitate to reach out to myself or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"308467\">@Olivier Karasira</span> to discuss further. </li>\n<li>If others also have real world implementations that we could put into a Connectathon, please do add on this thread. </li>\n<li>The IPS (International Patient Summary) was agreed to be an excellent base to consider for an African extension. </li>\n<li>Grahame also recommended what CSIRO's Ontoserver could do to potentially help integrate into the Africa environment. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"312409\">@Kate Ebrill</span>  please do share any insights here! </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyone else with further insights or useful notes from the call, please do drop them here.

This could provide some good exposure to a wider audience at the event. Chris offered to enquire of the organizers about the possibility. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"335762\">@Daniel Futerman</span> Please add any notes I may have missed here. </p>\n<p>Such a stream would need concrete work on the ground involving FHIR. Topics put forward included PEPFAR countries for data integration and reporting frameworks in Community Health Worker modules for Maternity and Child Health. </p>\n<p>There was also discussion on the possibility of regional events by Emeka. </p>\n<p>(Please anyone present feel free to add in any other missed or relevant information).</p>",
