A bunch of lawyers went through the statutes and regs and pulled out ones that seem to be in a particular domain (e.g., Health vs Privacy, but those are overlapping), and then differentiated those that seemed to have different security requirements than specified by NIST SP 800-171 - and made those laws/authorities \"specified\". So check the examples for the codes for idea on why they are different. <br>\nI'm the last to argue that any of this makes sense. It would likely have been much more efficient to just tell everyone to comply with 800-171 except where there's a more stringent security safeguard. Guessing this was the only way to downstream these security controls to the private sector. Oh well. </p>\n<p>Anyway, had some questions about Grahame's example so I can write a proper CR. <br>\nWe think we need to have all 3 CUI labels in the text, and that each of the CUI should be listed as a label so that access control systems can key off of the codes to determine which security controls to apply to the contents.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>       &lt;Patient xmlns=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;meta&gt;\n          &lt;security&gt;\n                &lt;system value=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode&quot;/&gt;\n                &lt;code value=&quot;CUISP-HLTH&quot;/&gt;\n                &lt;display value=&quot;CUI//SP-HLTH&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;/security&gt;\n            &lt;security&gt;\n                &lt;system value=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode&quot;/&gt;\n                &lt;code value=&quot;CUIHLTH&quot;/&gt;\n                &lt;display value=&quot;CUI//HLTH&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;/security&gt;\n            &lt;security&gt;\n                &lt;system value=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode&quot;/&gt;\n                &lt;code value=&quot;CUIPRVCY&quot;/&gt;\n                &lt;display value=&quot;CUI//PRVCY&quot;/&gt;\n            &lt;/security&gt;     \n           &lt;/meta&gt;\n         &lt;extension url=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/extension-must-display&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;valueAnnotation&gt;\n          &lt;authorReference&gt;\n            &lt;reference value=&quot;http://example.fhir.org/Organization/vha&quot;/&gt;\n          &lt;/authorReference&gt;\n          &lt;text value=&quot;**CUI//SP-HLTH/HLTH/PRVCY** ([VHA](http://example.fhir.org/Organization/vha))&quot;/&gt;\n        &lt;/valueAnnotation&gt;\n        &lt;/extension&gt;\n\n    RE &lt;text value=&quot;**CUI//SP-HLTH/HLTH/PRVCY** ([VHA](http://example.fhir.org/Organization/vha))&quot;/&gt;\n\n    How should the text indicate that CUI//SP-HLTH/HLTH/PRVCY has to be alone on the top line, and that below, the following example Designator Agency name/contact information must be displayed.

Yes, I'm fairly sure that there won't be \"portion marking\" - i.e., everything will be treated as CUI if anything is CUI.  Portion marking would be very burdensome with little value.  The difference between the security controls required by HIPAA Security Safeguards in the statute [which covers a broader set of information - i.e., IIHI, and not just ePHI] and those required by NIST SP 800-171 is a set of 26 controls, which are not heavy lifts - although in combination, they will take effort.  But that's nothing compared to trying to segregate CUI from non-CUI.  And that's likely not unintended - raising all security boats via CUI.  Eventually every provider/payer/BA will have CUI in their system, so think they'll all eventually comply with 800-171 in addition to whatever other security requirements pertain from other policies.</p>",

So, considering we already store <em>some</em> provenance information within the resource, I think the question is whether those arguments apply here to the case of CUI labeling authority.
