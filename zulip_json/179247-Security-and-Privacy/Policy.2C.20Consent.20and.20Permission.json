Permission is intended to cover all policy space related to data access policy (as distinguished from dress-code-policy).  Yes, Permission should end up looking much like XACML, but in FHIR form and using FHIR terms like Resource. Once that is done, then that concept will be removed from Consent, and Consent will be a resource specific to management of the patient specific policy. This would include the elements around when the consent ceremony happened, when it needs to happen again. This includes pointing at the scanned image of any paperwork that was part of the ceremony. The policy specifics would be in a Permission(s).</p>",

This regional legal definition of a word is not what we are covering in FHIR (a global standard)</p>",
