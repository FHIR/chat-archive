'request transfer of data' (as Grahame calls it) probably is the 'data portability right', this could be handled by the access control mechanism (but that will need to be GDPR aware, hence guidance will be needed). The 'data access right' requires that all sorts of stuff be logged about e.g. to whom any FHIR resource has been disclosed, and for what reason.</p>\n<p>If an item of data was captured with a 'lawful ground' provision-of-care you IMHO won't be able to deny erasure on any ground except \"comply with a legal obligation for the performance of a public interest task or exercise of official authority\" - mostly because there is some mandated retention period. If the data was captured for the reason of it being used in public-health, or research, then yes, one can deny erasure. You can't add a 'lawful ground for processing' after capturing the data, to do so means you'd have to ask consent from the patient.</p>\n<p>I'll be presenting on the GDPR and its impact on interoperability standards (using FHIR and XDS as examples) at the WGM in Cologne. A short version in the joint EHR/Security/.. meeting WED Q1,  and a full version at some other point in time (a BOF session perhaps). </p>\n<p>I have approached HL7 Europe (and discussed this with them 2 weeks ago) to suggest they need to take the lead in creating a GDPR implementation guide, after all this impacts them the most. Discussions in Cologne (between the European affiliate chairs, as well as at the technical level) will serve as input to scope the effort.  It's time for the Europeans to step up to the plate - all help is welcome, but to solely have Antipodians and Americans discuss EU legislation and its impact  just doesn't make a lot of sense.</p>",

One of the problems is that the Commonwealth and the US have a common-law tradition whereas continental Europe has not - this makes it harder (but certainly not impossible) for people with a common-law background to understand EU legislation. <br>\nTo make things even more interesting: the GDPR allows for 'member state extensions' in various places, and these can be 'modifier extensions' (to use FHIR speak). I'm aware of some of those for some EU countries - but we need to get more such examples to the table.</p>",

So whilst acknowledging a lot of work needs to be done in other areas (and there are tons of cross-industry whitepapers on these aspects of the GDPR) my focus tends to be on the 'how to use HL7 to support GDPR', i.e. what would a FHIR profile for GDPR look like? If a researcher has a spreadsheet with data on her laptop, one would support the GDPR stuff related to it using procedures. If one has a fullblown FHIR based EHR one probably wouldn't. If we can detail the use of FHIR in the latter context it will serve as inspiration in those contexts where FHIR isn't used to a similar high degree.</p>",

However, the guiding principle is that a person can request erasure of their data, and if there is no other legal reason which would override the right of erasure, then erasure it is. <br>\nIf you tell the patient you'll be pseudonimizing, and they request full physical deletion, you'll still have to do it.  Anonimisation would be a better option: effectively it would disassociate the data from the person. If one anonimises the legal ground for doing that upon an erasure request could be a) research, or b) management of healthcare processes.</p>",
