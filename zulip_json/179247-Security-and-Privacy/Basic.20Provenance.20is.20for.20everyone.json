Seems the Payer community does not see themselves in the Basic Provenance IG as a potential Author. The Author Provenance is for any author, not just medical credentialed people. This applies to the Patient, if they are the author, in the case of Patient Generated Data. This applies to the payer community when they are the original author of some data. This would be the social worker when the social worker is the original author of data. What is not allowed is for a payer to take data authored by someone else, and claim that the payer is the author. That is clearly not proper Provenance.</p>",
