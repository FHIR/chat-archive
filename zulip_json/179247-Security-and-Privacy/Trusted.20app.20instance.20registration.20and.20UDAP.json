We looked at some of the building blocks in UDAP for this, which were quite helpful -- but we also documented a number of <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/udap-spike#discovered-issues\">discovered issues</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyjxmVPSnx8\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyjxmVPSnx8</a> is an overview video talking through the use case, technical approach, and the (quick and dirty!) demo we built. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iwoPRNVBrwwbeWYTnGO1DiTTaSdJWG2snUI3HrHMbEk/present\">Slide Deck</a> with an overview of the problem + workflow</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft-healthcare-madison/udap-spike\">GitHub Repo</a> for our \"spike\" project</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-udap-security-ig\">UDAP from Sept 2021 Ballot</a> + <a href=\"https://udap.org\">https://udap.org</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to these technical findings, one of the <em>process</em> challenges which I've highlighted in <a href=\"http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-33275\">FHIR-33275</a> is that the UDAP ballot depends directly on drafts that <em>aren't</em> going through the HL7 process, so the discovered issues re: endorsement metadata, signatures schemes, etc can't adequately be addressed within the scope of the 2021 ballot. I'd really like to see UDAP support (or at least: leave out of scope and not make decisions to <em>prevent</em>) this pattern of client registration.</p>",
