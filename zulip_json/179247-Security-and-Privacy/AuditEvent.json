This is alternative to voting during the workgroup calls/meetings on each one. I have been working each one in the weekly meeting with Lloyd present when possible. So I have high confidence, but want high consensus.  I wanted to do a block vote with this group for two reasons: First, because I wanted to deal with them all at once, since there is significant overlap; second, to give the workgroup members plenty of time to think of the ramifications of the changes proposed in the block. When a block goes to vote, any member can request that a CR can be removed from the block prior to vote. --- I would also send notification of the block vote to the security and privacy zulip stream. You likely have seen this done with other groups.</p>",
