The RelatedArtifact structure defines resources related to a module such as previous and next versions of documents, documentation, citations, etc. Note that the name resource here is being used in a more general sense than the FHIR-specific Resource. The related resource may be a FHIR resource, or it may be another type of resource, represented using the Attachment data type.<br>\nThis extension SHOULD be used on a security label code for which justification or documentation can be found in an attached or discoverable information instance. Examples include a policy security label code, which is justified based on a law, patient consent directive, or organizational policy; a provenance security label, which is documented by a Provenance Resource; a trust security label code, which is documented by a trust accreditation certificate, trust mark, or a trust agreement such as a DURSA. <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/security-label-ds4p/2020May/spec.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/security-label-ds4p/2020May/spec.html</a></p>",
