As the testpage module does not generally get deployed in production servers, we consider this vulnerability to have a low potential attack surface, but there may be production users we are not aware of. Any users of this module are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>This vulnerability has been assigned CVE# 2020-24301 - <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24301\">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24301</a></p>\n<p>Note that we are launching HAPI FHIR 5.2.0 tomorrow and this vulnerability affects only HAPI FHIR 5.0.0 and below. We were a bit delayed in getting a CVE number to reference. Thanks to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191447\">@Mark Kramer</span> for his help getting that straightened out.</p>",
