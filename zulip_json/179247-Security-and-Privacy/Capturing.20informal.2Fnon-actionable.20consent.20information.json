That is, the patient is not giving (or denying) consent to anything but merely giving information about such a consent being given (or not) in some other context. This information, in itself, does not affect what can or can not be done - the actual consent information (with actual consequences) is, presumably, stored somewhere else.</p>\n<p>As long as it is just a \"raw\" questionnaire answer, that's all no problem. But now I want to map this to an individual FHIR resource and am asking myself which one it should be. One the one hand, this is information about consents to Consent seems the obvious choice. On the other hand, this information is \"one step removed\" and does not constitute a legal/procedural/etc. consent, something that must be clearly communicated so people do not act on it as if it were an actual consent. Which might argue for using another resource, say, Observation.</p>\n<p>Has anyone encountered smt. ike this or have good arguments for one option vs. the other?</p>",

        "content": "<p>That makes sense, but the problem is that in my case, I'm not capturing a stage in the lifecycle of a \"real\" (actionable) consent - only the statement that there was such a process (with a certain outcome) elsewhere. Yet the allowed R4 <code>Consent.status</code> codes all seem to refer to this lifecycle, e.g. \"inactive\" is \"The consent is terminated or replaced\" and \"draft\" is \"The consent is in development or awaiting use but is not yet intended to be acted upon\". Neither of those seem to apply to my case . My worry is that using them could leave the false impression that e.g. this is a \"real\" consent that might soon be activated.  (R5 is not an option for me but the situation there seems similar.) Or are the <code>status</code> code description overly narrow?</p>\n<p>To use a FHIR comparison: For medication, there is the workflow sequence MedicationRequest -&gt; MedicationDispense -&gt; MedicationAdministration, but  I need smt. more like MedicationStatement (aka MedicationUsage) that is explicitly outside the sequence.</p>",
