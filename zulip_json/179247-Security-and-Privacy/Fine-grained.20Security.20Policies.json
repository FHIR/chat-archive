One of the requirements is to bridge SAML and Oauth which I imagine is a pretty common use case. The bridging part enables users get an initial set of RT/AT's with the roles from the SAML login. When (clinical) users  wants to go into details of a certain patient, a new set of RT/AT's must be handed out based upon their affiliation with the patient (this is the only way to do it as I see it when users come from an existing SAML federation and you don't wan't to force users to log out, in order to elevate their rights if you can verify the correctness of this within the system). This is not needed when patient themselves access their record as their RT/AT's are fixed to themselves (much like SMART). This setup also uses the compartment definitions to some extent (- which I would encourage to have careteams added).</p>",
