Is the main goal to give more visibility to security defensive design tools like OWASP?  That is a worthy goal, I would add that we also point at security defensive design guidance from TLS, and OAuth. Possibly we should/could have CERT and Mitre/CVE guidance pointers as well. So, I like the goal, it just seems the <em>hook</em> \"Significant vulnerabilities have been found in FHIR Implementations in operational systems\" is a bit odd. I just find it odd, but I do agree it would be eye opening, one might say it burns the eyes like fire.</p>",
