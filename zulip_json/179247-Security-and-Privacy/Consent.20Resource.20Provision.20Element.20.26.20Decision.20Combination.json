        "content": "<p>Since this came up a few times in other threads and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191404\">@John Moehrke</span>  alluded to it again in the conversation today, I wanted to bring this to everyone's attentions in a separate thread. <br>\nI think by adding a <em>combining</em> or <em>conflict resolution</em> strategy, the current nesting <code>provision</code> structure in the Consent resource can be simplified to a flat array instead of the nested structure. Here are some arguments in favour of this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simpler and more Intuitive Semantics:</strong> A flat structure is easier to understand and corresponds better with the way we usually articulate policies and preferences (e.g. checkboxes in a form). Nested provisions deeper than two levels are too hard to follow to correspond to a user interface like a form and using them to model complicated policies soon leads to mental gymnastics which uses the nesting to implement something that can most likely be modelled in a simpler way. Single-layer nesting (\"general rule... except...\") which seems to be the only form realistically corresponding to real use-cases can easily be flattened into an array [general rule, exception rule] together with a suitable <code>deny-override</code> or <code>permit-override</code> conflict resolution strategy. </li>\n<li><strong>Existing best practice:</strong> two most notable existing authorization/rights language, XACML and ODRL use this strategy. XACML defines <a href=\"http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-cd-1-en.html#_Toc229296445\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-cd-1-en.html#_Toc229296445\">decision combining algorithms</a> to be associated with a policy to adjudicate possible conflicting outcomes from individual rules. Similarly, ODRL defines a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#conflict\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#conflict\">policy conflict property</a> to adjudicate any disagreements between the set of permissions and prohibitions in a policy. </li>\n<li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Having an array of provisions with a combining/conflict resolution strategy fits perfectly with the <em>map</em> and <em>reduce</em> processing model common in most modern programming languages. This makes the logic for evaluating the provisions straightforward, i.e. <em>map</em> each rule to a decision and then <em>reduce</em> based on the combining strategy. Nested provisions in contrast are arguably more complicated to implement and understand.</li>\n</ul>",
