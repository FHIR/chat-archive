Somewhere in the device or server that your client runs on, you have configured statically or possibly given via DHCP the IP address of one or more DNS servers. When the http client invokes a DNS lookup, say by trying to connect to a host by name, the client is actually making a DNS query to one of those servers (called recursors because those servers then start probing recursively around the Internet to get the IP address you need to make your connection from the host name you provide). It's rarely (maybe never) a good idea to include a full-fledged recursor in a client app.</p>\n<p>At a high level, DNSSEC is a way that the servers that actually hold the authoritative data about which IP address goes with which host name can digitally sign the responses they send back in a way that the DNS recursor can then validate its authenticity. This protects you from some types of DNS hijacking where your client can be tricked into connecting to an attacker's system even though you've entered the right hostname, as well as some DNS-based DOS attacks. Again, usually the client apps using that recursor cannot tell whether or not the recursor is using DNSSEC. Generally, if you're running your own DNS infrastructure, your DNS engineers <em>should</em> have the expertise to set this up correctly, both for your own recursors (so you don't get misdirected when looking up others), and also for your own authoritative servers (so others looking you up don't get misdirected).</p>",

I don't mean only checking the server's TLS certificate but also making sure sure a client app is presenting you at the sign in page for the intended healthcare organization and not a phony OAuth server maliciously referenced by a bad or compromised FHIR endpoint, say. phishing that is possibly abusing SMART app launch. Good directories can play a role here; certificates tied to the managing organization and not just the endpoint's hostname may also help.
