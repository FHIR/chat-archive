And am noticing that the way you fill out the AuditEvent, it is very hard to do audit log analysis to uncover where a permit was denied. I might want to do this so that I could then follow up on why was it denied, was it a legitiamte successful security policy enforcement, or was it a case where policy is not currently aligned with desire (e.g. the patient should be asked if they would like to allow the interaction, such as is done with point-of-care-consent like workflows).</p>",
