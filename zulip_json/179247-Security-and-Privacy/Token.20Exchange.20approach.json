Now let's say there's a 3rd party FHIR resource server which will  support token exchange grant. Will it be possible to extend the SMART app launch flow as below in order to consume the FHIR server APIs. Here the Gateway acts as the SMART app via token exchange.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/6Of9HZ2H2Nsgu_TpkyGOb94r/smart-on-fhir-modified.png\">smart-on-fhir-modified.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/6Of9HZ2H2Nsgu_TpkyGOb94r/smart-on-fhir-modified.png\" title=\"smart-on-fhir-modified.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/6Of9HZ2H2Nsgu_TpkyGOb94r/smart-on-fhir-modified.png\"></a></div><p>Thank you.</p>",
