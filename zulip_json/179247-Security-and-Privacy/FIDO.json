So it is not an interop-standard, it is something more... <br>\nNot a perfect analogy: It is to user authentication what bluetooth is to wireless IOT.<br>\nIn that it is an interface specification, a behavioral specification, performance requirements, and has certification requirements.<br>\nBecause of this it has great promise, but because of this it is seen as too rigid. So it is hard to understand if it will succeed or not.<br>\nThis is my understanding... welcome more informed, or even less informed, views</p>",
