The current download is a Windows EXE file; I was able to get it to work but it caused some issues with our corporate security software. I suspect Mac users might also have problems.</p>\n<p>Is anyone working on samples to show the mappings? It would be great to see a 278 and FHIR bundle side by side with the same data.</p>",
