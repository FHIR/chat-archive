This will improve care coordination by allowing a receiving provider, facility, or practitioner to reach out to the patient and deliver appropriate follow-up care in a timely manner. This policy will be applicable 12 months after publication of this rule.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/interoperability-and-patient-access-fact-sheet\">https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/interoperability-and-patient-access-fact-sheet</a></p>",

There are a couple of reasons why:<br>\na) the admission date can be a range of dates on the claim submission and both the admission date and discharge date can be a range on the claim inquiry.  Encounter just has a period, so we would have needed to add an extension to Encounter to support this.<br>\nb) the Claim inquiry has no other encounter information besides the admission and discharge dates so we wanted to maintain some consistency<br>\nc) we believe that authorizations might just have an admission or discharge date without other information from the CL1, so we wanted an easier way than the indirection of the Encounter resource with just a period.</p>\n<p>If this isn't justification enough for you, I encourage you to raise a Jira issue about it.</p>",
