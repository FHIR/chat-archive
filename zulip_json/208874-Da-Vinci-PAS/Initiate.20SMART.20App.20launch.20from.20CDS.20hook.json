We can work with any developer to manually register your CDS Hooks services within our open EHR testing environment. A few things to keep in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We support<code> patient-view</code>, <code>order-select</code>, and <code>order-sign</code> hooks. </li>\n<li>Be sure your SMART app is running over port <code>443</code> or <code>80</code></li>\n<li>Any appContext returned by the CDS Hooks Service should be a simple string.  We don't have full support on it yet.  Furthermore, the appContext value will be in the access token as <code>cerner_appContext</code> field.  This is only for our current Connectathon server, and not intended as a long term solution. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>cc: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191689\">@Hans Buitendijk</span></p>",
