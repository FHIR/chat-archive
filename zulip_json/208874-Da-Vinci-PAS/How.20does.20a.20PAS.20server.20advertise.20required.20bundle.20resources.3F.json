I guess my question is, if a payer's PAS server wanted to 'advertise' what resources they expect, is there a way to do that (in a computable format not via out-of-band contractual arrangement)? </p>\n<p>Or to illustrate a problem -- if my system, a DTR client, doesn't know that the PAS server requires certain resources in order to approve the request, it can't know a-priori, what resources to bundle up to meet the payer's requirements.</p>",
