The international domain of allergy/immunology specialists, allergologists in some regions, have extensive descriptions of non-allergic hypersensitivity.   There is a more constrained concept of \"pseudo allergy\", which is not a synonym but includes non-allergic hypersensitivity reactions that morphologically are difficult to distinguish.  The standards world has had only the categories of allergy and intolerance, intolerance being by default everything that is not allergy.  However, the term \"allergy\" is often used as if it is equivalent to allergy/intolerance.  Most clinicians who are not specialists and certainly most who are not clinicians empirically define allergy as \"something bad happened the last time I was exposed to that substance, and I think it is going to happen again if I am exposed to it again.\"  And yes, there is a World Allergy Organization, of which I was a card carrying member when I was in clinical practice.</p>",

        "content": "<p>@Jose Costa Teixeira @Rob Hausam @Jay Lyle @Michelle (Moseman) Miller The concept of the allergy list evolved 60 years ago when we did not understand the mechanism of an classical allergy reaction like anaphylaxis from penicillin and many of the drugs that now cause reactions that are mistaken for the same type of reaction did not exist. We have tried to differentiate that type of allergy (immediate hypersensitivity) form other reactions that individuals have by distinguishing two types of reaction and appropriating the term intolerance for those that someone believes are not an allergy. But every individual, patient or clinician, has their own definition of allergy which they work from. Jose's proposal to call the other reactions \"non-allergic hypersensitivity\" is at least mutually exclusive, which intolerance is not, since an allergic reaction however you define it is a form of intolerance. Non-allergic hypersensitivity is a term found in allergy texts and journals. But when allergy specialists (I am board certified in allergy and immunology) say \"type of reaction\" they are referring to the reaction at a cellular level, the mechanism of the reaction. They are consultants making a diagnosis, not creating an entry for an allergy list in a patient's record. When clinicians who are not specialists refer to the type of reaction, they are talking about the observation of the patient who is having a reaction. The morphology of the reaction. And they may refer to the reaction by a single prominent feature like rash, or wheezing, or giant swelling which does not distinguish between allergy and non-allergic. But it is all grouped under the category of allergy in the patient record and all that may be recorded is \"rash\". Elaine Ayres reported a few years ago that in the EHR of the NIH Clinical Center 29% of the allergy list entries said only \"rash\". Nothing else. I think an extension that captures known details about the reaction type (by anyones definition) would be a significant step in the right direction. The allergy list (Allergy/Intolerance Resource) is one of the greatest patient safety issues in clinical documentation that exists. Several recent studies by allergy researchers have shown that when patients with penicillin on their allergy list (the most common single entry) are tested and challenged with penicillin, they have NO reaction whatsoever. Yet CPOE systems are prohibiting them from being prescribed penicillin and other antibiotics that it is presumed to cross react with. And I will state the obvious: you can't cross react with something you don't react to. Fixing this problem starts with fixing the way we record the information.</p>",
