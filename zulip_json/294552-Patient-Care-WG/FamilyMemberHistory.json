We have tried to differentiate that type of allergy (immediate hypersensitivity) form other reactions that individuals have by distinguishing two types of reaction and appropriating the term intolerance for those that someone believes are not an allergy.  But every individual, patient or clinician, has their own definition of allergy which they work from.  Jose's proposal to call the other reactions \"non-allergic hypersensitivity\" is at least mutually exclusive, which intolerance is not, since an allergic reaction however you define it is a form of intolerance.  Non-allergic hypersensitivity is a term found in allergy texts and journals.  But when allergy specialists (I am board certified in allergy and immunology) say \"type of reaction\" they are referring to the reaction at a cellular level, the mechanism of the reaction. They are consultants making a diagnosis, not creating an entry for an allergy list in a patient's record.  When clinicians who are not specialists refer to the type of reaction, they are talking about the observation of the patient who is having a reaction.  The morphology of the reaction.  And they may refer to the reaction by a single prominent feature like rash, or wheezing, or giant swelling which does not distinguish between allergy and non-allergic.  But it is all grouped under the category of allergy in the patient record and all that may be recorded is \"rash\".  Elaine Ayres reported a few years ago that in the EHR of the NIH Clinical Center 29% of the allergy list entries said only \"rash\". Nothing else.  I think an extension that captures known details about the reaction type (by anyones definition) would be a significant step in the right direction.  The allergy list (Allergy/Intolerance Resource) is one of the greatest patient safety issues in clinical documentation that exists.  Several recent studies by allergy researchers have shown that when patients with penicillin on their allergy list (the most common single entry) are tested and challenged with penicillin, they have NO reaction whatsoever.  Yet CPOE systems are prohibiting them from being prescribed penicillin and other antibiotics that it is presumed to cross react with.   And I will state the obvious: you can't cross react with something you don't react to.  Fixing this problem starts with fixing the way we record the information.</p>",

The family member may not even be in the same country. That family member has not agreed to have a medical record.

This is further difficult when the family member is deceased for which their records may have been archived/purged.
