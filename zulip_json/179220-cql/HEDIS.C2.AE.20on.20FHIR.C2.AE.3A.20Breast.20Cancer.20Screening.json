This webinar will  expand on our recent HL7 FHIR Connectathon session, although attendance at that session is not a prerequisite for participating in this one. BCS-E is a digital adaptation of the traditionally reported Breast Cancer Screening measure; it has been modified for <a href=\"https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/the-future-of-hedis/hedis-electronic-clinical-data-system-ecds-reporting/\">HEDIS ECDS Reporting</a> , allowing health plans to use multiple data sources for quality measurement and improvement activities. </p>\n<p>This event will be an open forum for discussion and feedback, and will answer participants’ questions about the BCS-E measure and NCQA’s digital measures program. Discussion will focus on differences between HEDIS digital measures and eCQMs, development decisions and adherence to implementation guides. <strong>Interested parties can register <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/registration/eS_nc6i8UEmWV7v4gFYN7w,SA0Xhc5av0y_ZUhJQsUkSA,ScH9zQRq1Uyid6e_zopybw,YhBOFpmU006HsjjjvoCFlw,YrdS9j7ZokqOj5l1vX43WA,lQHO_aWnskmvnUKrMlqNAw?mode=read&amp;tenantId=73e72f79-bca8-4950-9657-bbf880560def\">here.</a></strong></p>\n<p>Measure package files and synthetic test data are available for public use <a href=\"https://github.com/cqframework/ecqm-content-r4-2021/tree/master/bundles/ncqa/BCSE_HEDIS_MY2022-1.0.0\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Key topics for discussion:<br>\n•   FHIR.Claim:  Identifying encounters, diagnoses, procedures and medication events via claims data.<br>\n•   Calculating health plan enrollment via FHIR.Coverage resources. <br>\n•   Health plan access to clinical resources (e.g., FHIR.Encounter, FHIR.MedicationDispense) vs. claims data (FHIR.Claims). <br>\n•   NCQA CQL libraries.<br>\n•   Measure results.</p>\n<p>We ask that registrants use the provided measure and testing materials to execute the CQL in their environments and report their experiences. We are specifically interested in errors encountered, challenges faced and variances between testing expectations and actual results.</p>",
