There isn't a 1-to-1 correspondence between what the engine \"looks at\" and what's in the CQL. For example, if the CQL says \"filter encounters to Date range\" and the engine has to load 1000 encounters in order to inspect the dates on them, it reports them all as evaluated. Similarly, if you have some CQL that's <code>Population</code> or <code>Unspecified</code> context and the the engine has to look at all the patients on your system to run the logic, it reports that it \"looked at\" them. Does that make sense?</p>",
