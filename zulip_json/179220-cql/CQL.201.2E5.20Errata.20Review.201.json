We are collecting and addressing those issues and have prepared an Errata publication to the specification.</p>\n<p>The CI build of the specification has all the proposed changes applied:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cql\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cql</a></p>\n<p>As discussed on the CDS WG call today, we have now frozen the CI build and are beginning a two-week peer review of the proposed errata update. We will seek approval of this Errata on the CDS WG call on February 16th.</p>\n<p>NOTE: There is an issue with the build that is preventing build of the Grammar, ELM, Tests, and Downloads pages. This also causes misalignment of the headers because the links are broken and that affects the styling. This is a known issue we are working with publication to address, but there is only one item (<a href=\"http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-35881\">J#35881</a>) that impacts the Tests page, and none of the other pages have impacts, so that issue should not affect the review.</p>\n<p>We have prepared a summary of the specification changes here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CDS/CQL+1.5+Errata+1+Review\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CDS/CQL+1.5+Errata+1+Review</a></p>\n<p>Please feel free to raise comments here, on the CDS list serve, on the applied trackers, or if appropriate, submit a new tracker.</p>",
