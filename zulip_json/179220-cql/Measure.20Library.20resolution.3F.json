As far as I can tell, if a Measure references a library via URL of <a href=\"http://test.com/Library/someLibrary\">http://test.com/Library/someLibrary</a>, it tries to resolve it by looking for a Library resource with an <code>id</code> of \"someLibrary\". Which would mean an assumption that the leaf portion of the URL is always the same as the ID of the library; and that doesn't seem quite right... Is my understanding correct? And how does that relate to a library that is referenced in the text/cql? Does it <em>load</em> the libraries that are referenced directly in the Measure and then expect that the Library is loaded with a matching version number when processing the text/cql?</p>",

That should only be a fallback though. If the Measure.library element correctly specifies an existing library by url, that will be used to resolve. If the canonical reference doesn't have a version, the latest version of the library is used.
