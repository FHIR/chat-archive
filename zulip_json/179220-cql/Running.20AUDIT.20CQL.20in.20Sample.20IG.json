However, I am running into issues with the ValueSet-db.json where it cannot find resourceType element. Is there a sample of ValueSet-db.json that I could refer to? The FHIRHelper file that we were able to find in the repository (<a href=\"https://github.com/asbi-cds-tools/asbi-screening-app\">https://github.com/asbi-cds-tools/asbi-screening-app</a>) was only available in JSON. Is there a method to convert this to a CQL version (or if there was a CQL version available)? </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192545\">@Alex Goel</span> </p>\n<p>Thank you,<br>\nChrista</p>",

On <a href=\"https://github.com/asbi-cds-tools/asbi-screening-app\">github</a> we checked in an empty value set json file because there are codes in the value sets which require a UMLS license.  You can find out more at the <a href=\"https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/\">Value Set Authority Center</a> but you'd need to sign up for a UMLS account, generate an API key, and then run a script to populate the value set json file.

        "content": "<p>Hi Christa!</p>\n<p>The cqf-ruler doesn't use the ValueSet-db.json file so you'll need to download the ValueSets and convert them manually. As David mentioned you can get the ValueSets from VSAC, which will export them in excel format. Each ValueSet you export can then be converted to fhir using the cqf-tooling operation that's here:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/cqframework/cqf-tooling/blob/master/src/main/java/org/opencds/cqf/tooling/Main.java#L32\">https://github.com/cqframework/cqf-tooling/blob/master/src/main/java/org/opencds/cqf/tooling/Main.java#L32</a></p>\n<p>That will output the ValueSets in the FHIR JSON format that the cqf-ruler can use. The ValueSets needed are the ones listed in the .cql file. Let me know if you have further questions. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
