None of the artifacts are electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQM).  Perhaps some of the confusion is because some artifacts might be <em>derived</em> from an eCQM -- but they are not an eCQM anymore; they are CDS that uses similar logic and value sets as an eCQM -- but they're not a measure.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197485\">@rekha</span>.  Technically speaking, the CQL specification does not specify any way of indicating if a CQL library is a measure, CDS, or something else.  CQL libraries are just logic -- so you need to see how the CQL is used to determine if it's for a measure or CDS.  That's why I suggested you'd need to look at surrounding documentation or accompanying standards-based files.</p>\n<p>There <em>might</em> be some hints in the CQL file itself, but they are only hints.  For example, if you see an expression called \"Measure Population\" or \"Numerator\", then it's _probably_ a measure -- because the <a href=\"https://github.com/esacinc/CQL-Formatting-and-Usage-Wiki/wiki/Formatting-and-Usage-Topics\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/esacinc/CQL-Formatting-and-Usage-Wiki/wiki/Formatting-and-Usage-Topics\">CQL Formatting and Usage (for eCQMs) Wiki</a> suggests these names for all CMS-based measures.  You <em>might</em> run into CDS that defines a \"Numerator\" expression, but it doesn't seem likely (but \"Initial Population\" and \"Denominator\" very well _might_ show up in CDS).  Similarly, if you run into an expression called \"Recommendation\" or \"Suggestion\" then there's a good chance it is CDS and not a measure.</p>\n<p>But as I said, these are only hints -- and they will not work 100% of the time.</p>",

We do not plan to host eCQMs in CDS Connect, so you'll likely never get CQL w/ MeasureReports from CDS Connect.  And while we do have CQL that <em>could</em> be integrated into a CDS Hooks service, there is work required to do so (involving either the CQL Services tool I've already pointed to or the CQF Ruler that Bryn has already pointed to).</p>",
