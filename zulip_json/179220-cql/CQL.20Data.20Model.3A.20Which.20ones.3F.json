Is there any guidance on which of these data models will likely be used in the future? Should we plan to just support one of these going forward? Or is the guidance to be able to work with all four of these (and any others??)?</p>\n<p>I thought I had heard something about QUICK not being as prevalent now, but I may have misheard that. I also thought that QDM was an older data model that we were moving away from, but I noticed in the Cooking with CQL meeting that QDM was still being used. Any guidance would be very helpful, so that our engineering teams can better understand what we will need to support.</p>",

Most CQL-based CDS that is being written today (that I'm aware of) uses the core FHIR data model.</p>",

QDM is used still used for the CMS Annual Update eCQMs; Annual Updates are published in May every year and apply to the reporting period for the following calendar year.  The May 2021 Annual Update is for the CY2022 reporting period, where QRDA reports would be submitted to CMS, e.g., in 1QCY2023 (depending on the CMS program).  CMS has not said when eCQMs would be based on FHIR, but there is work to convert the QDM-based eCQMS to FHIR.  The capability in CQL to \"using QI-Core\" is new; it is an example of \"profile-informed authoring\", where in that case the FHIR profiles are from the QI-Core IG.  In CQL \"using foo\" requires a \"modelinfo\" for \"foo\".  Tooling now exists to create a modelinfo for any FHIR profile, which is intended to make it easier on CQL authors to write CQL in accordance with that profile (or IG with a set of profiles), compared to authoring CQL for the base FHIR specification (modelinfo).  For now, most efforts to create CQL for FHIR-based applications are \"using FHIR\" as opposed to some profile of FHIR like QI-Core.</p>",
