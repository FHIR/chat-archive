We're using it as part of a pipeline and would prefer to use a tagged release,  however the biggest feature we want is the recent switch to it only being a singleton FHIR server (versus the previous STU3 and R4), so there's no release with that yet. If there's not going to be one in the near future, can we consider the current master as stable and working or is there a previous commit you'd recommend for that?</p>",
