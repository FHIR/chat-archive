The only required environment variable now is <code>UMLS_API_KEY</code> -- as it replaces <code>UMLS_USER_NAME</code> and <code>UMLS_PASSWORD</code>.  Please ensure that your environment variable is set in such a way that it is available to other processes.  How you do this depends on your operating system, but... are you setting it in the same terminal/console that you're using to launch CQL Services?  If you set it in a different terminal tab or window, then it might not be available to the CQL Services process.  Also ensure you're using the latest version of CQL Services (<a href=\"https://github.com/AHRQ-CDS/AHRQ-CDS-Connect-CQL-SERVICES/releases/tag/v2.0.0\">v2.0.0</a>).</p>",
