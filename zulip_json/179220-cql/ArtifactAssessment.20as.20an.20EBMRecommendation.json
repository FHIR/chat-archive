        "content": "<p><a href=\"http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-34412\">J#34412</a> proposes to add several metadata elements from the Conformance resource pattern (url, version, title, status, and useContext) to support use cases where ArtifactAssessments would be used as knowledge resources, and be expected to support the same content management capabilities as any other knowledge artifact. Specifically an EBM Recommendation, or a Peer Review assessment. Without these elements as first class, profiles will need to define extensions for each of these elements, and in particular the searchable elements are problematic as extensions when using these in knolwedge repositories, for example. What is the argument for not including these in the resource? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192085\">@Brian Alper</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"449294\">@Joanne Dehnbostel</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"193307\">@Derek Ritz</span></p>",
