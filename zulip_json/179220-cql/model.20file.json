In the github project there is a project called xsd-to-modelinfo, which can be used to create model files from xsd-files. Where do I get those xsd-files from or how do they look like ? Can they be automatically generated using the bunch of StructureDefinition-files my FHIR-model is based on ? Is it recommended to write/generate such an xsd-file and let the xsd-to-modelinfo-propject generate my model file, or should I write my own generator that directly generates my model file ?<br>\nGreetings</p>",

However, because xsd's don't support everything the FHIR StructureDefinition does, the xsd's are a lower-fidelity model, so a generator directly from the StructureDefinitions is preferable.</p>",

Is the generator for the schemas from StructureDefinitions openly available ?</p>",
