I assume it would be \"Episode-of-care-based\"  (the number of items (such as encounters) in each population) rather than \"Patient-based\" (the number of patients in each population), but this is not clear from the cv section of the IG.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here's my current understanding of how it should look:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>{\n  &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;MeasureReport&quot;,\n  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;complete&quot;,\n  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;summary&quot;,\n  &quot;measure&quot;: &quot;http://my-measure.com|1.0.0&quot;,\n  &quot;period&quot;: {\n    &quot;start&quot;: &quot;2020-01-01&quot;,\n    &quot;end&quot;: &quot;2020-04-01&quot;\n  },\n  &quot;group&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;population&quot;: [\n        {\n          &quot;code&quot;: {\n            &quot;coding&quot;: [\n              {\n                &quot;system&quot;: &quot;http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/measure-population&quot;,\n                &quot;code&quot;: &quot;initial-population&quot;\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          &quot;count&quot;: 200\n        },\n        {\n          &quot;code&quot;: {\n            &quot;coding&quot;: [\n              {\n                &quot;system&quot;: &quot;http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/measure-population&quot;,\n                &quot;code&quot;: &quot;measure-population&quot;\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          &quot;count&quot;: 200\n        },\n        {\n          &quot;code&quot;: {\n            &quot;coding&quot;: [\n              {\n                &quot;system&quot;: &quot;http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/measure-population&quot;,\n                &quot;code&quot;: &quot;measure-population-exclusion&quot;\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          &quot;count&quot;: 1\n        }\n      ],\n      &quot;measureScore&quot;: {\n        &quot;value&quot;: 0.2\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre></div>",
