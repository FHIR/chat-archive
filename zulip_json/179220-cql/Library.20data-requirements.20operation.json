For the <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/library-operation-data-requirements.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/library-operation-data-requirements.html</a> operation in SYSTEM context, there is a parameter target specified. The operation definition is not clear on what the contents of target should be. It is defined as a string and described as \"The target of the data requirements operation\". IMO, that could be a Library or a Measure. It could be a resource ID (e.g. 123 assumed to be Library), a resource reference (e.g. Library/123) or a canonical URL (e.g. <a href=\"http://test.com/fhir/Library/Test\">http://test.com/fhir/Library/Test</a>). </p>\n<p>I tried looking in cqf-ruler to see how it was treated there. Unless I'm missing something the Library data-requirements operation isn't even supported there. LibraryOperationsProvider uses DataRequirementsProvider, but doesn't actually expose an operation for it. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191359\">@Bryn Rhodes</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194178\">@JP</span> either of you want to comment on the importance of this operation and how to treat the target? Should I just leave it out of my implementation as well? If not, what content should I expect in that parameter?</p>",

Since that was defined there have been several other patterns for this type of operation.

I know that changes are underway in several IGs, but my thought was that if I implemented the core specification, I could then build on it for IG support. This is great example of how that might not be the best plan. Another example, I hit is the $care-gaps operation which has been improved in DEQM.  I'll maybe spend some time noodling on that again. Appreciate the input.</p>",
