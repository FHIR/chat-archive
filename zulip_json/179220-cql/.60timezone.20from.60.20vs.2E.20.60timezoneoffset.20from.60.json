However,  when looking through the CMS eCQMS (example: <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-measures/Library-mat-global-common-functions-FHIR.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-measures/Library-mat-global-common-functions-FHIR.html\">MATGlobalCommonFunctions</a>), they use the syntax <code>timezone from MyDateTime</code>. Are one or both of these correct?</p>",
