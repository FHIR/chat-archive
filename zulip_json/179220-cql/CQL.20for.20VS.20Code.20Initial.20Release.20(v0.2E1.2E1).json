It should have feature parity with the Atom plugin, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CQL syntax highlighting</li>\n<li>CQL error highlighting</li>\n<li>Local CQL execution</li>\n<li>Viewing ELM</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Right now it's a direct port of Atom. We expect it to evolve to be more VS Code friendly as we go along.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cqframework.cql\">cqframework.cql</a></p>\n<p>You can install it by searching for \"CQL\" in the VS Code Extension panel.</p>\n<p>Please report any issues <a href=\"https://github.com/cqframework/vscode-cql/issues\">here</a></p>",
