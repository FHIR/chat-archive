Grouping by age-sex is straightforward in CQL, has anyone here tried to return results grouped by patient location or does anyone have an idea of the best way to do this? I know you can specify location in the subject attribute of a measure, but I am thinking that will mean calling <strong>$evaluate-measure</strong> for each of the individual locations.</p>",

By default, the subject is \"Patient\", so the criteria are expressed in terms of patient-level queries. But you can use Measure with different subjects, such as \"Location\", which would mean that the criteria are written with respect to a particular Location. This corresponds with the \"context\" declaration in the CQL, so instead of saying \"context Patient\", you would say \"context Location\". Does that help?</p>",
