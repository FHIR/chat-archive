The AHRQ CDS Authoring Tool that you referenced is designed for the CDS use case (rather than eCQMs).  That said, it exports normal CQL logic, so it's possible that the exported logic could be used in eCQMs too (as long as you want <em>FHIR</em>-based eCQMs).  If you want QDM-based eCQMs, however, then FHIR-based logic won't work for you.  The task of creating the more measure-specific aspects (like MeasureReport) is not supported at all by CDS Authoring Tool.

To write a complete eCQM (using FHIR) you would also need to author instances of the appropriate FHIR resources from the FHIR Clinical Reasoning (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/clinicalreasoning-module.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/clinicalreasoning-module.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/clinicalreasoning-module.html</a>).  I'm not aware of any tools that will help you author these using a graphical interface.  You may need to manually author them using a text editor (if you are on Windows, perhaps Notepad++ with the FHIR plugin).  As for authoring CQL, I noted how the CDS Authoring Tool could <em>potentially</em> be used for this, but since it is designed for CDS, it would still require some manual adjustments to the output.  I would recommend you try <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191359\">@Bryn Rhodes</span>'s suggestion and use atom with the CQL extension.  It means you will need to learn how to author CQL manually, but this is a worthwhile investment -- and CQL is designed to be easily learned.  I'd start by looking at the Author's Guide (chapter 2) of the specification at <a href=\"https://cql.hl7.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://cql.hl7.org/\">https://cql.hl7.org/</a>.</p>",
