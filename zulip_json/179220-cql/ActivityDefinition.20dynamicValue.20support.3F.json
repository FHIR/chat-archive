Following example from CPG-on-FHIR for \"send a message\".  After much trial and error, I dug into the code and it appears that only Boolean values are support for any ActivityDefinition dynamicValue (see ActivityDefinitionApplyProvider, line 134).  Any dynamic value other than Boolean will cause entire ActivityDefinition apply to fail.  Would it be appropriate to expand the list of result types to DateTime, String and others?</p>",
