I'm currently trying to create logic for a measure and have run into a roadblock when trying to create stratifications for the populations.  I've checked the HL7 CQL author's guide and the developer's guide (along with almost every page available on the CQL Release 1 site) but have found no hints on how to proceed.  Does anyone know how this is supposed to be done or could point me to an example that I can work off of? I would greatly appreciate it.</p>",
