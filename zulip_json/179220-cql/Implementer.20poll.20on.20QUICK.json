        "content": "<p>The current QICore implementation guide includes an authoring-focused view of the profiles called <a href=\"https://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/quick/QUICK-index.html\">QUICK</a>, which is intended to provide a consolidated, author-focused view of the profile for CQL authors. When QICore was first published, this was a useful view that was not available anywhere else in the IG tooling. However, the HL7 publication template now includes a new \"Snapshot Table (Must Support)\" view of each profile that provides exactly what the QUICK pages were intending to provide, and so we are proposing to remove the QUICK pages from the QICore IG in favor of this new Must Support profile view. To help inform the decision, we are polling the CQL authoring community to make sure that this change would not negatively impact authors and/or implementers.</p>\n<p>If you have an opinion, please respond to this short survey here: <a href=\"https://www.menti.com/zqx8azptik\">https://www.menti.com/zqx8azptik</a></p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>",
