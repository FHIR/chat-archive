The CDS Connect authoring environment can still be used to author the CQL originally, but packaging it within a Library and then referencing it from a PlanDefinition and/or Measure is a fairly manual process at this point. Examples of CDS Hooks services implemented by a PlanDefinition using CQL are available <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/cqframework/opioid-cds\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/cqframework/opioid-cds\">here</a> and examples of Measures are available <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/cqframework/hedis-ig\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/cqframework/hedis-ig\">here</a>.</p>",
