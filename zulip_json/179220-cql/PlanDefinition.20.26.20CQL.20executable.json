I'm aware of the examples available in PlanDefinition, but these examples are somewhat elliptic in that they do not provide the detail of the cql expressions referenced from PlanDefinition. Are there detailed guidelines on this FHIR to CQL binding somewhere, possibly with executable examples?</p>\n<p>Regards</p>",
