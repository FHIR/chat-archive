You can now validate CDA documents using the FHIR validator, and also use FHIRPath against CDA documents. </p>\n<p>I'm just listening to Oliver describe this now, and realising that this means that it's technically possible to use CQL against (C)CDA. I don't know exactly what that means for CQL - probably some rejigging of underlying assumptions, but I suspect it will prove to be a useful thing to be able to do</p>",
