In a Library resource you can refer to CQL with a relative path, URL, or base-64 encoded. At our Burden Reduction meeting on Wednesday. Someone suggested that relative paths should not be allow. Implying only base-64 or a full url be allowed. So, my question was if we require a full URL how does the auth work if any? I understand base-64 is still a best practice.</p>",
