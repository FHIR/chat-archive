However the standards used to represent in Electronic\nFormat are different , which leads to a lot of duplicate effort. CQL framework tries to solve the same problem by\nbringing the common pieces together.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>While I got the idea theoretically, I couldn't find an example use case of the same either on that page or any where else. Can someone please provide an example use case for the same. It would be better to have an example in the background section to help us understand better.</p>",

I think it will be helpful to have example while getting the introduction only from a scenario basis(or requirement basis) not really implementation. What I mean here if a person who is not really bothered about implementation level details but still can read and get the functional perspective. Something like below:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>The report/screening details\nThe output CQM looking for\nThe output CDS looking for\nThe common pieces for both\nThe specific pieces for both\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Lack of experience in HealthCare DecisionSupport/QualityMeasurement might be the reason I was finding it hard to relate, not sure what does others think.</p>",
