The valuesets can then be used with the operator \"in\" or with implicit filtering like [Encounter: \"Inpatient\"].<br>\n- can the valueset be implicitely be defined in the statement, like with: [Patient] A where P.gender in { Code '2.16.840.1.113883.3.560.100.2'}<br>\n- How can a valueset be defined that contains multple codes ? In the specification there are only examples that explicitely reference a valueset-id (e.g. \"Acute Pharyngitis\": '2.16.840.1.113883.3.464.1003.102.12.1011'). How would a valueset definition look like if the codes would be explicitely be mentioned in the value set definition, like with: valueset \"Acute Pharyngitis\": {'Code '66071002' from 'SNOMED-CT:2014'}<br>\nGreetings<br>\nGeorg</p>",
