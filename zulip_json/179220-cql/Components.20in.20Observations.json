For example, how would I find patients who's most recent BP observation occurred in the last year and has a systolic component that's greater than 140 or a diastolic component that's greater than 80? The first part of this seems straight forward - \"Last\" of an Observation with a BP code and effectiveDate of last year, but then I need to do a \"where\" type of test on each component of that observation to see if it has a code of SBP and a value &gt; 140 or a code of DBP and a value of &gt; 80. I've found a number of examples of BP measures, but they seem to assume that there aren't components even though components are part of both the QUICK and FHIR observation models.</p>",
