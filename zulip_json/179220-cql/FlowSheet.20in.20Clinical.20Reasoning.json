I'm really looking more for a way to say something like, \"this is the important data to display: Chronic conditions and their onset, Active medications, inpatient surgeries in the last two years, most recent BMI.\" In a pseudo-structured format, it might look something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>&lt;summary&gt;\n  &lt;items name=&quot;Chronic Conditions&quot; expression=&quot;ChronicConditions&quot; iterator=&quot;C&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;property name=&quot;name&quot; expression=&quot;C.code.text&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;property name=&quot;onset&quot; expression=&quot;C.onsetDateTime&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;/items&gt;\n  &lt;items name=&quot;Active Medications&quot; expression=&quot;ActiveMedications&quot; iterator=&quot;M&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;property name=&quot;name&quot; expression=&quot;m.medicationCodeableContext.text&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;property name=&quot;ordered&quot; expression=&quot;m.authoredOn&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;/items&gt;\n  &lt;items name=&quot;Inpatient Surgeries in Last Two Years&quot; expression=&quot;InpProceduresLast2Y&quot; iterator=&quot;P&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;property name=&quot;name&quot; expression=&quot;P.code.text&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;property name=&quot;date&quot; expression=&quot;P.performedDateTime&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;/items&gt;\n  &lt;item name=&quot;BMI&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;property name=&quot;value&quot; expression=&quot;LastBMI.valueQuantity&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;property name=&quot;date&quot; expression=&quot;LastBMI.issued&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;/item&gt;\n&lt;/summary&gt;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Like I said, I just made that up above, but perhaps it could potentially be approximated via CQIF Questionnaire?
