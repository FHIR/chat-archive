        "content": "<p>Hi Tien   Medication  Request  corresponds to \"Medication, Order\".   Medication Statement corresponds to  \"Medication, Active\".  Thus the former would relate to an order in the EHR versus the latter relating to the active med list.  EHRs often use a null medication stop date as the flag for an active med.  Clinicians 'add' a medication to the list as an order.  So Vitamin D  added to the med list 5 years ago as an order with an open end date would be captured on the Medication Statement but would not necessarily be in Medication Request filtered to current year.  I hope this is helpful  /PM</p>",
