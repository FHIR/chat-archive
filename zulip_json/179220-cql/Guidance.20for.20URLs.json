And should the canonical URL always be used in the depends-on relationships? There seems to be some inconsistency in the FHIR examples and connectathon resources. I see some depends-on relationships using a canonical URL such as <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/Library/FHIRHelpers|4.0.1\">http://hl7.org/fhir/Library/FHIRHelpers|4.0.1</a> and then others using  a resource and resource id such as Library/library-FHIRHelpers-4.0.1. I know both are technically valid, but I'm looking for best practice recommendation. I feel like maybe I should be making up my own URL prefix (<a href=\"http://company.com/fhir/\">http://company.com/fhir/</a> or something like that) and using that for all of the related artifact declarations.</p>",
