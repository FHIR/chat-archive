I was looking at Bryn Rhodes' Youtube videos from 2018 and 2020, and he mentions that CDS is being used for potential Opioid overuse, Antenatal care with WHO, and screenings for breast cancer, colon cancer, and other cancers.</p>\n<p>I found the Opioid overuse screener, but haven't seen the Antenatal care or the cancer screening use cases. Can anyone point me to those?</p>\n<p>I work for a primary care group -- I suspect those may all be good use cases for my company. If you are aware of others who are using CQL and CDS in primary care, please let me know what you have seen.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>-Daniel</p>",
