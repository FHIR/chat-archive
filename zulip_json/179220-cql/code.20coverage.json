We wrote a series of tests in CQL, and then have a process that converts them into <code>data.coffee</code> files that just contain a reference to the resulting ELM JSON.  Eventually I'll probably convert this over to just use straight up JSON ELM (e.g., <code>data.elm.json</code> instead of <code>data.coffee</code>) -- but this may still at least be a start at being helpful?  Note that the actual assertions, however, are still in <code>test.coffee</code> files.  <a href=\"https://github.com/cqframework/clinical_quality_language/tree/master/Src/coffeescript/cql-execution/test/elm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cqframework/clinical_quality_language/tree/master/Src/coffeescript/cql-execution/test/elm\">https://github.com/cqframework/clinical_quality_language/tree/master/Src/coffeescript/cql-execution/test/elm</a></p>",
