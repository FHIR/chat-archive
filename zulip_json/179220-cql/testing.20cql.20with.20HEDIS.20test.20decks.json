Everything work fine so far.</p>\n<p>Recently, I received a <code>HEDIS test deck</code> that doesn't look like a set of FHIR bundles.<br>\nI wouldn't like to re-invent the wheels. I wonder if somebody has already done solving the test decks.<br>\nIs it a good idea to convert it into FHIR format bundles or there is a better path I should go.</p>\n<p><a href=\"user_uploads/10155/SeeRb_siu49fE5E9d9439FHG/test-deck.jpg\">test-deck.jpg</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/10155/SeeRb_siu49fE5E9d9439FHG/test-deck.jpg\" title=\"test-deck.jpg\"><img src=\"user_uploads/10155/SeeRb_siu49fE5E9d9439FHG/test-deck.jpg\"></a></div><p>Thanks!</p>",
