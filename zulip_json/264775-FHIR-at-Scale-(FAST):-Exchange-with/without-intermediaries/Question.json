Here are my thoughts.  1) For large data sets, synchronous APIs are not always a good idea but the bulk data FHIR asynchronous model is.  It can use our approach as well without holding connections open for too long 2) We have, but we plan to handle that in a separate IG for 'intermediary scale'.  There are existing patterns that handle that well today that we can use.</p>",

SFTP and other protocols can handle large files well enough but given we are trying to improve interoperability through FHIR, I was wondering how that might work.<br>\n2.) Ahhh, OK. I'm new to the \"IG\" stuff. What is the existing pattern within FHIR to handle retries? HTTP/REST requires the individual hops to implement their own handling of retries. So, I was just curious about how this might work.</p>",
