I have two questions/suggestions dealing with the options that use headers. </p>\n<p>For the two intermediaries scenario, there is an option that uses HTTP headers, X-Originator and X-Destination, that contain the intermediary information. I'm wondering why instead of defining a new X-Originator header, the standard X-Forwarded <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded</a> header was considered? </p>\n<p>For the single intermediary scenario, no originator header is passed to the final destination. I'm wondering why? Tracking the originator could be important to the destination.</p>",
