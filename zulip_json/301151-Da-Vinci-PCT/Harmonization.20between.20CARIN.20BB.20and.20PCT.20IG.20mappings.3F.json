The worry is that anything that adds to the FHIR mapping and implementation work that Payers (and Apps) have already done under the CMS Patient Access API mandate, may take away from the FHIR adoption momentum we've achieved so far (especially given that FHIR is optional for the PCT mandate). Other thoughts welcome.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192054\">@Viet Nguyen</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"331378\">@Vanessa Candelora</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191884\">@MaryKay McDaniel</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"198783\">@Larry Decelles</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"195991\">@Tony Benson</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196791\">@Michael Gould</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191924\">@Linda</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"237264\">@Gary Gryan</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"295432\">@Caleb Wan</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191938\">@Durwin Day</span></p>",

This could be started now and be provided as specific feedback to the IG ballot along with justification so the community can evaluate the  importance, necessity and implementability of each item.</li>\n<li>Along with 2, we need a recommendation of the harmonization approach. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Who can support this analysis?</p>\n<p>There's a balance between  minimizing profile proliferation, while recognizing that new profiles must be created if existing one do not support the data and workflow needs of new IGs. I would also like feedback from other, non-BCBSA payers as to the need, utility and feasibility of any harmonization that we pursue.</p>",
