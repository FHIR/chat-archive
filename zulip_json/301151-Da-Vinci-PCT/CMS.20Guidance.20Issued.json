Diagnosis codes may not be required on certain GFEs -“A provider or facility is required to provide a diagnosis code only where one is required <br>\nfor the calculation of the GFE. For example, in situations in which a provider or facility has not <br>\ndetermined a diagnosis, such as for initial screening visits or evaluation and management visits; <br>\nor if there is not a relevant diagnosis code for an item or service, such as for certain dental <br>\nscreenings or procedures, providers and facilities are not required to include diagnosis codes on a <br>\nGFE. However, the provider or facility must include the expected charges and service codes for <br>\nthe items and services to be furnished during that visit, even when no diagnosis code is available. “, and also the NPI of the provider must be the one for the provider furnishing the service, and not a “group” NPI.  The guidance is available on the CMS NSA web site.</p>",
