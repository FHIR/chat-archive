If payers decide they wish to provide an AEOB via FHIR, in the spirit of reusability, couldn’t the CARIN BB IG be adapted to provide the AEOB?  This would allow payers and 3rd party developers to leverage code they defined for the Patient Access API, making adoption of a FHIR API for the AEOB much easier to implement.  Coding to the profiles currently defined in the PCT IG will require payers and 3rd party developers to write new code.  As a result, adoption could be low.  <br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192132\">@Amol Vyas</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"243554\">@Pat Taylor</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196791\">@Michael Gould</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"240289\">@Ranjith Kandur</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"195991\">@Tony Benson</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191924\">@Linda</span></p>",
