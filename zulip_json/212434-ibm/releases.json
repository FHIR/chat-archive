        "content": "<p>A few words on some of the features added in this release:</p>\n<h3>Overloaded fhir-model setters that take native Java objects</h3>\n<p>A common complaint with users of our visitable, thread-safe model is that the conflicts between FHIR class names and common Java classes like String, Integer, Date, etc is annoying.  We've had static factories that you can import in order to avoid needing to fully quality these FHIR class names in most places, but with this release you can forget those static factories and construct your model objects with those java types more directly.</p>\n<h3>Support conditional create-on-update via If-None-Match</h3>\n<p>We've had an implementation of the spec-defined conditional create and conditional update interactions for a while, but we're quite aware that our implementation cannot provide strong guarantees in the face of multiple conditional creates that come at once.<br>\nBy using this HTTP mechanism instead, we can more easily provide this guarantee, making it suitable for data loading scenarios where you want to conditionally create a resource without the risk of overwriting an existing resource.<br>\nIf this goes over well, I could imagine us proposing this option back to the HL7 FHIR infrastructure group as an alternative to the existing spec-defined search-based conditional interactions (which are trial use).</p>\n<h3>Support SMART authz policy enforcement for bulkdata operations</h3>\n<p>The FHIR Bulk Data Access IG prescribes the use of \"SMART Backend Services\" for bulk export, but we've never had a good way to enforce the authorization of corresponding access tokens from within the server.  With 4.10.0, the IBM FHIR Server's fhir-smart module can be used to enforce <code>system/</code>scopes before allowing access to the $import, $export, or $bulkdata-status operations.  Checkout <a href=\"https://github.com/Alvearie/keycloak-extensions-for-fhir\">https://github.com/Alvearie/keycloak-extensions-for-fhir</a> for one approach to implementing a SMART Backend Services-enabled Authorization Server that can grant said scopes.  I'd also like to make this easier to put together in the future, so stay tuned / contact me if you'd like to help.</p>",
