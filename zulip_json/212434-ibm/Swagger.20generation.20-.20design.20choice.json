        "content": "<p>In general, my goal for the IBM FHIR SwaggerGenerator was to emit a simplified FHIR schema that would make it easier for Swagger tools like IBM API Connect to ingest the definitions and display meaningful documentation and examples.<br>\nFor example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>FHIR supports extensions on primitive data types.  However, the JSON serialization for that is a bit \"interesting\", and these primitive extensions aren't used much in practice...so the generated swagger omits those.</li>\n<li>FHIR supports \"contained\" resources, and so each resource type could technically contain any other resource type within it.  However, that blows the schema out so that every endpoint would need to include every datatype.  Instead, we include just the elements for the resource(s) being generated.</li>\n<li>FHIR choice elements with a type of <code>*</code> (like <code>Extension.value[x]</code>) can technically reference any FHIR data type, including rare/obscure ones like those defined at <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/metadatatypes.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/metadatatypes.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/metadatatypes.html</a>. For simplicity, we omit these from the swagger definition unless the Resource has an explicit field with this type.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In all three cases, the IBM FHIR Server is fully capable of handling these, but the FHIR Model just doesn't lend itself real well to Swagger (or even JsonSchema) and so we've tried simplifying it to make it work better.<br>\nWe don't have a ton of experience with these simplified definitions yet, so your feedback on this approach is definitely appreciated.</p>",
