(i searched around internet and found some recommendation to using hapi-fhir server).</li>\n<li>currently i can setup IBM FHIR server on my own locally on eclipse, now i am looking for a webapp example (GUI) that can work with my local ibm fhir server. so do you know if there is any such kind of that example ? I see that for hapi-fhir server - it provides a public test server including basic webapp here: image.png <a href=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/resource?serverId=home_r4&amp;pretty=true&amp;_summary=&amp;resource=Patient\">http://hapi.fhir.org/resource?serverId=home_r4&amp;pretty=true&amp;_summary=&amp;resource=Patient</a><br>\n Thanks,</li>\n</ol>",

        "content": "<p>Hi Thuan.  On number 1, they are totally independent implementations of the same standard.  There's many design differences (and also some similarities).  We've tried to differentiate our project by providing a highly-configurable and more performant implementation that is more turn-key / closer to production-ready out-of-the-box.<br>\nOn number 2, you've correctly surmised that the IBM FHIR Server is an API offering...no UI.  If you just want to play with the API you can use our swagger ui page (e.g. <a href=\"https://localhost:9443/openapi/ui\">https://localhost:9443/openapi/ui</a> if you've installed it locally).  If you want to layer on a web UI we have an example/demo of how to do that at <a href=\"https://github.com/Alvearie/patient-browser/tree/master/chart\">https://github.com/Alvearie/patient-browser/tree/master/chart</a></p>",
