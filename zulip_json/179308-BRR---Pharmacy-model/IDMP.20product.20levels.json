We do need information models. UK dm+d has been mapped to SCT for years (and so could be put into CodeSystem), and it does cover the gross structure, virtual to actual packs and so on, but it's a necessarily incomplete mapping. </p>\n<p>Medication Definition is more than just a bunch of codes. Day-to-day prescribing may need just the codes it is true, and the very small Medication resource (often just a code and a coded form in there). For that you can just use SCT or NDC etc and it's fine. Maybe a CodeSystem full of codes is all you need to support that. </p>\n<p>But that is not the same use case as the Medication Definition resources, where you are giving the entire product data such as the strengths of the ingredients. </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191337\">@Dion McMurtrie</span>  There is overlap between Medication and the Medication Definition set of resources it is true, but they are a world apart. Medication is for the day-to-day prescribing cycle, the key basics. MedicationKnowledge is for data <em>about</em> medications - usage, context, guidelines, pricing etc. The Medication Definition set (so that is MedicinalProductDefinition, PackagedProductDefinition etc, here <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/medication-definition-module.html\">http://build.fhir.org/medication-definition-module.html</a>) are for the fundamental <em>definitions</em> of the medication items themselves - the intrinsics. And overlap does exist, but is managed by using the same structures in both. Both use the Ingredient resource for instance and both use ClinicalUseIssue for the indications. The MedicationKnowledge resource has an \"associatedDefinition\" link to a MedicinalProductDefinition resource that lets you hold the full data if you need to.<br>\nIt should also be possible to point a Medication at a MedicinalProductDefinition, if you choose to host your medication definitions in a structured FHIR format and want to use a reference (and not an indirect code lookup). And that will also show that there is prescribing of medication and there is definition of medication and they stand separate but connected. You cannot directly prescribe a MedicinalProductDefinition, you only prescribe a Medication that \"has-a\" MedicinalProductDefinition (just like it \"has-a\" SCT code often).</p>",

Don't take any of this the wrong way, I'm just trying to get my head around it so I know what bits to use for what, and why things are there.</p>\n<p>I get the use case for the Medication resource as it is. Perhaps it is a little over simplified, but it is a resource that provides simple yet sufficient identification and definition of a medication for clinical use cases (like prescribing, dispensing, recording...etc). Could just be a wrapper around a code which provides all the definition, or it might define the medication in the case of a compounded medication or extemporaneous preparation. Makes sense.</p>\n<p>MedicationKnowledge confuses me a bit, because it has some information like costs, monitoring programs, guidelines etc (which make sense), but it also has amount, dose form, ingredients, strengths which seem highly overlapping with Medication and/or MedicinalProductDefinition it references. To me that seems like redundant information that I'm not sure when to/not populate, and what to do if it disagrees.</p>\n<p>The Medication Definition resources seem to be for regulators and manufactures rather than clinical use cases? It seems to mirror IDMP which is very much in this space. I guess one of my questions is if IDMP exists, what is the benefit of replicating it in FHIR? Wouldn't the regulators/manufacturers just use IDMP because that's what it is for? It would be different if IDMP didn't exist and something was needed in that space, but IDMP does exist and seems to be progressing and have traction. So unless there are real deficiencies with IDMP doesn't FHIR just need a way to reference IDMP things, rather than redefine a rendering for them in FHIR? Perhaps I'm just missing a whole bunch of context and use cases. I'm far from an IDMP expert.</p>\n<p>However that aside, if FHIR does take on that use case, it feels like we have MedicationKnowledge, Medication and MedicinalProductDefinition (et. al.) considerably overlapping. Both Medication and MedicinalProductDefinition \"identify and define\" medications, and MedicationKnowledge doesn't set out to do that but has enough elements to put it in that space and be problematically overlapping.</p>\n<p>It feels to me that there is a single thing - medication -  that we are trying to identify and define, and then possibly attach some other non-defining information to for different use cases. I think those things - the identification/definition and the non-defining information - should be kept separate. I'd really like one way to identify and define things, and then structures that can attach information to that thing without overlapping.</p>\n<p>So I guess my questions are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>isn't Medication (identification and definition) really just a chopped down profile of MedicinalProductDefinition cleaving away the detail that is unnecessary to meet the clinical use cases?</li>\n<li>shouldn't the MedicationKnowledge (non-defining information) reference and add information to, but not attempt to redefine the defining parts of the identifying/defining resource it is referencing (whether that is Medication or MedicinalProductDefinition)?</li>\n<li>why are we replicating/rendering IDMP in FHIR rather than referencing it?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It may well be that I'm missing a heap of context that makes sense of this and I've really got it all wrong - I'm more than happy with that! If anyone can correct my logic above and help me understand it I'd really appreciate it!</p>",

So the Medication Definition resources cover that scope (but are not limited to it), and allow you to actually use IDMP. If you want to send IDMP using CSV files or in your own made up XML, you can. But people want to use FHIR.</p>\n<p>Medication is in effect a chopped down profile of the MedicinalProductDefinition resource plus the other Medication Definition resources, yes.<br>\nIt could have been physically a profile of that resource it is true and this was seriously considered as a design choice and discussed at some length by the committees. This approach was rejected because it would mean that Medication, a very key resource in FHIR would be appear much more complicated, for those new to FHIR. It would be a profile - and no core \"resources\" are profiles - and of something that seems very alien to a pharmacy person. The stuff in MPD resource is not that familiar to prescribers (we hear) and they don't need to have it up front. So this was simply a deliberate design choice to make FHIR easier to understand overall. Not a technical choice, a practical ease of use one. Yes it comes with some downsides.</p>\n<p>MedicationKnowledge does reference and not redefine some things such as Ingredient and ClinicalUseIssue (for indications etc). I would like to see more of that and there is ongoing work there. For instance the PackagedProductDefinition resource is being considered for the packaging parts, I understand. I think MK could evolve so the definitional parts are less to be honest, and it becomes more clearly about context. But that is just one opinion and this is all a process of discovering what works best for the people that actually want to use these things. Sometimes a small amount of duplication is better than having to use a huge other structure (you don't want to reference a whole other resource to have \"form\" (a code)). And sometimes it's not.</p>",

I see no problem with codes systems evolving to have more of the properties of information models, such as concrete data. And for fairly static things that is ok. Nether information nor terminology is perfect for all use cases and both will continue to co-exist I am sure. There does come a point when a model like FHIR is just easier to use than the SNOMED model though, imho. </p>\n<p>But the real difference is when you have dynamic data. When you are exchanging data about an evolving product, around different parties, who are updating different pieces (over months or years), you need an update-able model rather than one that is mostly intended to be read only distribution format. Then once you have that need, you have those definitional resources even if you don't intend to update them often. And people may want to use the same structures for both circumstances.</p>",

They need to add several types of elements - things like \"official prices\", \"existing literature\", \"history of recalls\", interactions..... And they need to do this on any level, not just the official IDMP levels.<br>\nThat boundary is already fuzzy enough, but even when prescribing, in some cases you need to tell more about the medication - for example in cross-border prescription you need to say</p>\n<p>I prescribed \"Italian prescribable code 12345\" - but I can also tell you this is acetaminophen 500 mg tablets box of 20.</p>\n<p>This wil make sure that the receiver side can understand what was prescribed even if they don't know the code.<br>\nthese cases are all in the \"priouct definition / specification\" and a flatter model, with one resource type, that can be profiled in the different concepts, works, and works better.<br>\n\"</p>",

Making it part of a dedicated resource called \"administrable product\" seems a convention (a design option).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If it turns out that it doesn't get used in a way that makes it need a standalone resource, we can get rid of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By \"get rid of it\" I assume you mean \"get rid of the resource type\" - that will be a good step. <br>\nMy bet: If you ask regulators/MAHs, they are bound to IDMP, they will love a standard really matching their roadmap. If you ask MPDs providers, I don't think you will have a clear answer.</p>\n<p>All I am asking is to entertain the alternative and support the variety we have out there - because that is much more known and certain that IDMP right now. For me the current approach is a misstep - which is arguable, and given the extensive work so far, I think it is best to move forward (I don't want to stop the train). But we should be aware it is one option, not the only thing that works.</p>",

This may affect the applicability of your outstanding Jira. You use a single MedicinalProductDefinition resource for: identifiers, names, form, routes, legal status, classifications, ingredients, package type, cross references, manufacturer, description and other characteristics. I expect that will cover most of the simpler use cases, and it is also of course still possible to use the richer structures when required.</p>",
