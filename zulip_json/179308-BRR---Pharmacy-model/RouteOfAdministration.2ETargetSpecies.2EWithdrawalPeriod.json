Your proposal as expressed in the JIRA issue is not very clear beyond a statement of reducing perceived duplication.  So create some diagrams and some examples that convey the existing resource data elements in your proposed new way.  If you want to express it as actual FHIR resources, that would be even better.  Once you are done, update your JIRA ticket with the diagrams, examples, and/or pointer to the FHIR resources.<br>\n2) Come to a BR&amp;R call to discuss your model proposal.  Explain how it achieves your desired end goal.  Based on the discussion, BR&amp;R may decide to accept your proposal, to reject your proposal, or to allow both proposals to be expressed in the build for implementer feedback.<br>\n3) Assuming that BR&amp;R agrees that your proposal has merit, then complete the work in the current FHIR build so that it can be dealt with at an upcoming FHIR connectathon.<br>\n4) At the connectathon, existing implementers will review, discuss, implement both proposals and provide their feedback back to the workgroup.<br>\n5) Armed with the connectathon feedback, BR&amp;R will either decide on one or the other proposals or they may allow both to go to ballot to get even wider feedback.<br>\n6) After ballot and before publication, the chosen proposal will be kept in the build.</p>\n<p>Hope this makes sense.</p>",
