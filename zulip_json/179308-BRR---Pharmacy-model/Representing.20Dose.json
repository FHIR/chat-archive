The medication code is a SNOMED code.</p>\n<p>The guidance for datatype Quantity has this text:  If the unit can be coded in UCUM and a code is provided, it SHOULD be a UCUM code. If a UCUM unit is provided in the code, then a canonical value can be generated for purposes of comparison between quantities. </p>\n<p>When evaluating a MedicationAdministration resource, how would an implementation know that a dose is represented as some multiple of the strength for the requested medication (10 mg) vs: a reference to the dose form (e.g. 2 tab)? Is the intent to find this information from the MedicationAdministration reference to Medication.ingredient.strength which is a ratio? </p>\n<p>Use case: transmitting cumulative dose information to a registry</p>",
