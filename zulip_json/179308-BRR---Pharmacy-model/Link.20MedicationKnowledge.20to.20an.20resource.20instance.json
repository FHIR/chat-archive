This one was raised by FDA. <br>\nYes the function of an ingredient is an intrinsic characteristic of an ingredient, because a FHIR ingredient is always in the context of a product (or at least some other thing that it is a part of). Otherwise it would be little more than a substance. <br>\nIngredients have strength, and this naturally is in the context of its use in something else - no ingredient truly has a strength in and of itself. The function is in the context of the same thing. <br>\nIf an ingredient has two different functions in two different products then yes that would be two ingredients. If it had a different strength in those two products then it would already be two different ingredient resources. The same substance can be an excipient or an active ingredient, and again that would be two different ingredients.</p>",
