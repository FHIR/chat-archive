        "content": "<p>Hi all,<br>\nThe one or the other might have heard that we from SAP together with Cerner (Europe) re-invent our patient management and clinical solution using a FHIR-native approach. Because the Encounter is THE central object for almost every of our use-cases we had a deep look into this resource-type (and struggled a lot with it). Therefore, we are really happy to see that this has not been carved in stone yet.<br>\nMajor requirements we currently struggle with are:<br>\n- Efficient calculation of length of stays. This includes the necessity to efficiently identify admission and discharge (the “dynamic” attribute length doesn’t solve the problem)<br>\n- Evaluation for Public List (DE: Pförtnerliste): where’s the patient now?<br>\n- Handling of e.g. planned discharges<br>\n- Handling of absences<br>\n- Defining relations to respective encounters in case of escorts, e.g. mother accompanies her child<br>\nIn addition, we see some inhomogeneous modelling with respect to time dependencies:<br>\n- In some cases, there’re attributes for the current value and a respective history node (e.g. class). For location there’s no such a differentiation.<br>\n- To serve the above-mentioned requirements best, time-dependency is missing for the serviceProvider (we interpret this as the department and a transfer from internal medicine to intensive care and back must not lead to interruptions of the encounter).<br>\n- Time-dependency for subjectStatus would be necessary as well (e.g. to calculate overall waiting times)<br>\nIn the area of admission- and discharge-reasons we see a distribution of the respective attributes across reason and reasonReference and within the hospitalization node. (Especially the hospitalization.preAdmissionIdentifier is totally unclear to us). Last not least we would need to be able to document not only the actual location, but as well the originally requested category, e.g. 1-bed-room.<br>\nAs a result, we composed a logical model with the following major changes:<br>\n- Introduce direct attributes for current values for all time-dependent fields<br>\n(status, class, subjectStatus, serviceProvider, location)<br>\n- Introduce one history-node containing a period plus all the above-mentioned fields for the historic values)<br>\n- remove encounter.length<br>\n- introduce a reason-node containing type, code and reference to all possible related causes and remove respective fields within hospitalization (code is necessary to express a fact described within the type, e.g. “re-admission” using legally defined code-systems)<br>\n- introduce a period node containing a period and planned-indicators<br>\n- introduce a separate absences-node with type, period and planned-indicators<br>\n- replace individual references to accounts, episodes-of-care and appointments by a new context attribute. In fact, we would like to get rid of the Account-reference at all and replace it by the introduction of a context attribute within the Account resource-type. This would better reflect the sequence of the business process and the ownerships of the resources. <br>\nPlease find the complete logical model attached. <br>\nMany of the changes are hard to reach via extensions and in principle we aim for plug-and-play integration scenarios. Therefore, we are eager to discuss our approach to make it ready for the next maturity level.<br>\nFinally: sorry for the lengthy text…<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/ZEMN8YxpwUxqxoZW-MXoVwL_/EncounterSAPProposalV1.StructureDefinition.xml\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"EncounterSAPProposalV1.StructureDefinition.xml\">EncounterSAPProposalV1.StructureDefinition.xml</a></p>",

Why not just create Encounter profiles that correspond to the transaction that you wish to perform, e.g. EncounterAdmit, EncounterDischarge? Otherwise you will push lots of business logic to the client who has to know how to communicate an \"Admission\" or \"Discharge\". These are business related operations, and they will likely have their unique models. This type of question goes for all business related operations, e.g. state transitions. </p>\n<p>Or am I misunderstanding the point of the twitter post? :)</p>",

That type of view normally comes from a very CRUDy view of REST where you always create (POST) or manipulate (PUT, DELETE) the full resource. I dont believe it is a good way to design APIs as it pushes loads of business logic onto consumers.
