I write this because to increase interoperability it is better if everyone uses the same \"system\"-URI if refering to the same real system. <br>\nIf I get your eMail-address correctly, you're from France, is that right? In this case (a) there is a profile on simplifier for French patients (<a href=\"https://simplifier.net/frenchprofiledfhirar/frpatient\">https://simplifier.net/frenchprofiledfhirar/frpatient</a>) and (b) there is a stream for France where you can ask about France-specific  matters, e.g. national identifiers. If I'm wrong about France, I apologize.</p>",
