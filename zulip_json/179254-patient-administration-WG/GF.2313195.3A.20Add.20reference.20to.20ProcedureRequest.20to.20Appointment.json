Once an MRI has been ordered, there is a subsequent appointment to determine when (and with what MRI) the order should be fulfilled. In imaging workflows this is a common use case, but it probably applies to other requested procedure types as well.\"</p>\n<p>There already is a proposed resolution:<br>\n\"Include a new property to appointment:<br>\nBasedOn 0..* Reference(ProcedureRequest)<br>\n(We will be happy for other request types to be included.)\"</p>",
