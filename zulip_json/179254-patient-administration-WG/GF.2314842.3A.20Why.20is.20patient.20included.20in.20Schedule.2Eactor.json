The schedule resource is meant to represent the availability of anyone who would be involved in an appointment.  Patients of course can be involved in appointments, and a patient Schedule can let systems know when the patient is available (for example, they have appointment already booked for certain times, so those slots aren't available for new appointments).</p>",
