We are interested in capturing this information (which is sometimes available in the EMRs) particularly to know status such as Living Alone, Living in Care Home etc.  Although I've found the HL7 FHIR list for same, I can't find a Resource field to hold it - where should this be used?  <br>\nKind regards, Alan.</p>",
