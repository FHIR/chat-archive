The PV1 segment has PV1-41 which is the the Account Status (defined helpfully as \"This field contains the account status\") but it's not clear how this may relate to other account related content (PID-18 for example, or a coverage or guarantor). In FHIR, Encounter.account references an Account resource, but given that account data may be distributed throughout different parts of a v2 message, how do systems combine that into something that might approximate an Account resource?</p>",
