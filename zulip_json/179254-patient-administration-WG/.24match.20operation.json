        "content": "<p>I am implementing a /Patient/$match operation which queries a standalone MPI system to find matching patient resources sourced from a separate EHR application.  Within the EHR, the same human person is likely to exist multiple times (as separate FHIR Patient resources) if they visit multiple practices or departments.  If the input demographics find a valid match in the MPI system, I would like the $match operation to return a Bundle containing all the Patient resources from the EHR <em>and</em> a Person resource representing the unique human as linked by the MPI.  Would this be considered compliant with the <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient-operation-match.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient-operation-match.html</a> spec?</p>\n<p>The description mentions the response should be a bundle of <em>Patients</em> but I feel that including the Person resource as well would better express the information we are trying to convey in this case.  We could format the MPI record as another Patient resource, but it would be only an empty \"shell\" Patient which has no meaning within the EHR itself and hence would never be associated with any clinical or financial resources.  So for this reason I feel the intent would be more clear to return this one as a Person instead.</p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>",

I'm not aware of specific wording to that effect for operations, but at least the behaviour you sketch appears to be in the spirit of how FHIR works. As long as the operation does at least that which is documented, it could return some additional information/resources.</p>",
