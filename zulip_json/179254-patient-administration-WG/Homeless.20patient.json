Note it's rather jurisdiction specific how one deals with addresses for homeless persons, whether they have a registered address at a shelter, etc. In a lot of EU countries you have to have a registered address somewhere (although still some people don't have one). If you're on the road in your motor home, assuming you're a law abiding citizen, you'll probably register at an address of a family member or a friend.</p>\n<p>The AU extension 'no fixed address' extension looks good to me..</p>",
