No properties should be included for a datatype with this property unless: Those properties themselves directly translate to a semantic of \"unknown\". (E.g. a local code sent as a translation that conveys 'unknown') Those properties further qualify the nature of what is unknown. (E.g. specifying a use code of \"H\" and a URL prefix of \"tel:\" to convey that it is the home phone number that is unknown.)\".</p>\n<p>But it is not clear to me how this applies to most of the cases where the binding is required and the datatype is code (maybe only for the FamilyMemberHistory.sex ?)</p>",
