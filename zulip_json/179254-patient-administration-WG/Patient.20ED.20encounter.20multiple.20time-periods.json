We are looking to map an ED (ER) Encounter from an EMR, where the Emergency Dept encounter has a few different start/stop timestamps -   arrived/discharged;  moved to Triage room / seeing a triage consultant;  moved to a Bed.  If two or three of these were recorded during an ED Encounter, how would we record it in FHIR - several .period entries?  sub-encounters?  </p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nAlan.</p>",
