Note that this is precisely the text so you can search and replace it in all resources if you want. While I'm at it, I noticed the the comments field on .active across the resources is some what inconsistant - some are quite useful while others only cover a subset of the information; suggest that you standardise across all of them where appropriate.</p>",
