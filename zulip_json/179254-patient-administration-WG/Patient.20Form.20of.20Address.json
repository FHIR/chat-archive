This solution however has a couple of downsides:<br>\n1. we don't have a standard qualifier for \"salutation\" to distinguish this prefix from <em>actual</em> name part prefixes<br>\n2. in German (and probably other languages as well), salutation is only half the answer, because basically every adjective needs to be gendered and even the salutation changes depending on casus.<br>\n3. it's not clear, how to use a prefix to express a patient's request to be addressed gender neutrally<br>\nTherefore we are leaning towards \"extension\".<br>\nQuestion: is this a potential candidate for standard extension, or is this something that should be defined with national scope?</p>",
