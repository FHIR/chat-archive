However, this is not known to the scheduler. The scheduler will know that Actor '#3' has rejected it. Actors #1 and #2 may already have accepted it. So would the scheduler just set the status of both to 'needs-action' ?<br>\nWe may need an actor-status parameter, to query for participant-status for some specified actor.</p>",
