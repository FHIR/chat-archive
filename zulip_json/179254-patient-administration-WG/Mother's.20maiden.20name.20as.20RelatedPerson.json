If it's important to capture more than just the mother's maiden last name, having the ability to use the HumanName data type would be helpful. This is coming up in a v2-to-FHIR discussion where PID-6 can contain more than just the last name (<a href=\"https://v2plus.hl7.org/2021Jan/data-type/XPN.html\">https://v2plus.hl7.org/2021Jan/data-type/XPN.html</a>) and we don't want to lose information by either just transforming the last name to the extension or stringing together other name components into a string value in the extension.</p>",

If you are needing to track KBA properties (like mother maiden name, first car, favorite sports team, etc.) it seems like putting those in either a common extension or maybe Observation makes the most sense.    Scattering the KBA properties across RelatedPerson and other resources seems undesirable, as an app trying to do KBA would need to 1) know where all the KBA answers are and 2) requests scopes for all those resources.</p>",

A RelatedPerson resource is primarily used for attribution of information, since RelatedPersons are often a source of information about the patient. \" the person need not be active in providing care and it is about attribution.
