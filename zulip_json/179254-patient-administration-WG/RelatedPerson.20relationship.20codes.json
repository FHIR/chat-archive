Would it be OK to state that these relationships is ordered the other way around.

It was actually a review of the preferred ValueSet (<a href=\"https://terminology.hl7.org/1.0.0/CodeSystem-v3-RoleCode.html#v3-RoleCode-_PersonalRelationshipRoleType\">https://terminology.hl7.org/1.0.0/CodeSystem-v3-RoleCode.html#v3-RoleCode-_PersonalRelationshipRoleType</a>) that made me reach out to the community in this matter.</p>\n<p>In my case the current state of the definitions actually gives me just the flexibility I need to define another ValueSet containing the norwegian codes that express the relationship in the opposite direction of what is stated in the preferred ValueSet provided by HL7. The wording in the preferred ValueSet is quite clear to me but as you write you need to interpret \"the subject\" and \"the scoper\" correctly according to the FHIR model. I to believe some additional information concerning these matters would be welcome to most readers of the FHIR definition. I will create a Jira issue to propose some information is added to the documentation to better guide the reader in these matters.</p>",
