        "content": "<p>Hello,<br>\nI am working in a trilingual country (Belgium: French/Dutch/German) and we often use English as our 'lingua franca' in ICT.<br>\nWhen a required valueset is only published in English on the HL7 pages, mostly it is not a problem.<br>\nHowever, when I look at  e.g. <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-patient-contactrelationship.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-patient-contactrelationship.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-patient-contactrelationship.html</a> I see there are also German and Dutch translations provided. Two questions:<br>\n-What is the route to add translations there?<br>\n-Would it not be better to also specify countries here? (When a valueset contains medical values translated to Dutch used in the Netherlands, these are not by definition the same as Dutch in Belgium. Same for France/Canada/Belgium, Germany/Belgium and I guess also USA/UK etc.)</p>",
