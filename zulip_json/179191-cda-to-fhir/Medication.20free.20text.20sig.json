The 2015 C-CDA spec says the sig SHALL contain one text, which SHALL contain one reference, which SHOULD (?) contain a value that points to the sig in the section narrative. Has anyone mapped this to MedicationAdministration? I'm presuming the sig would become dosage.text, but what should we do with the formatting in this case? It seems like stripping out the HTML might potentially garble the meaning...</p>",
