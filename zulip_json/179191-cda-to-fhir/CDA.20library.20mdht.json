Would be good to know whether mdht is a good choice for CDA-FHIR conversion going forward.</p>",

The project has support for CDA and FHIR but the CDA is much more mature and complete.  It used to support ONC CDA validation <a href=\"https://github.com/mdht/mdht/releases\">https://github.com/mdht/mdht/releases</a> here   There is no specific CDA to FHIR transformation support  - An option there is open source MDMI which supports CDA to FHIR using a model driven approach. As far as teh java doc - the build is part of eclipse which should generate java docs will look into it</p>",

Any idea?  thanks.</p>",
