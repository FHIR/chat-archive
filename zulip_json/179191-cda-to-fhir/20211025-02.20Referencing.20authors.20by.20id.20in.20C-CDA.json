This assignedAuthor SHALL contain at least one [1..*] id (CONF:1098-31473). Note: This id may be set equal to (a pointer to) an id on a participant elsewhere in  the document (header or entries) or a new author participant can be described here.  If the id is pointing to a participant already described elsewhere in the document,  assignedAuthor/id is sufficient to identify this participant and none of the  remaining details of assignedAuthor are required to be set. </p>\n<p>Proposed Resolution:<br>\nCF: Yes, this guidance is accurate and can be applied when determining the author.</p>\n<p>FC: create specific authorship where is known. Only use Provenance Author Participation for authors who are explicitly identified in a Provenance Resource associated with the information. Context Conduction may be used to minimize the redundant author information. referencing by id mechanisms may be used to minimize redundant author information.</p>",
