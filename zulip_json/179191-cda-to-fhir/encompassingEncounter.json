        "content": "<p>Hi FHIR community. We are looking for a reliable way to connect Encounters to clinical instances (e.g., procedure, condition, etc.) when converting CCD to FHIR. It seems that aligning CCD encounter clinical entry dates would not work in most cases and may lead to error. Generating a FHIR Encounter from a CCD encompassing encounter works nicely, but the resulting FHIR Encounter would lack required properties such as class and type, thus requiring a dataAbsentReason. Has anyone considered this approach? From a FHIR standpoint, does it seem reasonable? Thanks for any guidance you can give.</p>",

You might consider aligning based on date from encounter elements in the Encounter section when it is present.  Codesystemz for FHIR Encounter type and class are Example and Extensible, so you should be able to find an appropriate code value to use to express a physician encounter that doesn't carry the essential details about setting or specialty.</p>",
