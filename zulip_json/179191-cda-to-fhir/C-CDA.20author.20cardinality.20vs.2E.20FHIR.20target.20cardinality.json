For example, the Model-Based Transformation Service (MBTS) DRAFT Mappings for CDS Hooks Use Case has multiple instances in which the source C-CDA author element has a cardinality of 0..* according to a given C-CDA template, but the target FHIR resource attribute for the author information has a cardinality of 0..1.  Specifically the C-CDA Problem Observation template that the CCDA to CCDA-on-FHIR ProblemObservation to Condition.xlsx mapping pertains to indicates that the Problem Observation CCD Element should have its descendant author/assignedAuthor element data mapped to the FHIR US-Core-Condition.asserter; however, the cardinality of the author element within the C-CDA Problem Observation is 0..* vs. the cardinality of the FHIR US-Core-Condition.asserter which is 0..1.  I don’t see anything in the CCDA to CCDA-on-FHIR ProblemObservation to Condition.xlsx mapping that indicates how to resolve these differences in cardinality.  Am I missing something?  Have any standard rules been recommended for selecting the ‘preferred author’ when multiple author elements are encountered in the C-CDA document?  For example:</p>\n<p>•   When mapping from C-CDA Problem Observation authors to the FHIR US-Core-Condition.asserter, always prefer authors based on type (prefer PractitionerRole over Practitioner, and either of these over Patient…) and the most recent date/time (author/time/@value). <br>\n•   Some C-CDA author elements can be converted into a PractitionerRole (e.g., the author element includes an assignedAuthor/representedOrganization &amp;/or a Healthcare Provider Taxonomy code) while others may only be converted into a Practitioner.   <br>\n•   When resolving between PractitionerRole authors vs. Practitioner authors, always select the ‘practitioner’ (PractitionerRole or Practitioner) with the most recent author/time/@value.  If all author/time/@values are equal, prefer a PractitionerRole author over a Practitioner author.  If multiple PractitionerRole authors share the same most recent date/time, prefer the one that was 1st in order of appearance under the Problem Observation.<br>\n•   Always prefer an author that can be converted into a ‘practitioner’ (PractitionerRole or Practitioner) over those that can be converted into a Patient or RelatedPerson.</p>",
