We also have the feature of pulling CCD from different sources implemented using the XCA Query and XCA Retrive in hl7 V3 (RIM) . We are planning to get the incoming CCD and convert that into the FHIR bundle of type document. <br>\nI know this group have been working on similar objective. Please advise and help me by providing the guidance and any material available.</p>\n<p>Also, I am available to help anything team need here.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nDheeraj</p>",
