Thus all you need to do is create a section, add \"No Information\" in Section.text and leave the entries blank. </p>\n<p>The emptyReason element in Composition.section is a hold over from when we represented entries with a List resource. If you populate it, use this value set:<br>\n<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/valueset-list-empty-reason.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/valueset-list-empty-reason.html</a></p>\n<p>However, I believe SDWG voted at some point to remove that element in the next release of FHIR, so frankly I would just leave it off.</p>",
