These are large and deep templates, and possibly recursive. How do we manage this? </strong></p>\n<p>These entryRelationships have inversionInd=true. It means: these medications were administered (or ordered) because of the reaction the patient had.  Or: these procedures were performed or ordered because of the reaction the patient had.</p>\n<p>Proposed Resolution:<br>\nCF: Model small templates in line, especially if values depend on context. </p>\n<p>FC: use entryRelationships to other needed templates.  We'll need to consider each case to determine the correct typeCode, or consider if we can provide a general principle for when to use which typeCode and when inversionInd needs to be true.</p>",
