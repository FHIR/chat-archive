To further qualify the question, of most interest is the pattern of populating the value of “system” and the value of “value” in the FHIR identifier datatype associated with Resource.identifier, Resource.meta.id.identifier, and the Resource.somethingproperty(e.g. who).Reference.identifier.identifier when the source of the information is an entry in a CCD document. Any other comments or recommendations appreciated Thanks.   Ken L.</p>",
