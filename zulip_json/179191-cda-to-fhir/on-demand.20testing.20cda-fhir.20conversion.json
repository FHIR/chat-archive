To help understand the challenges in doing CDA conversion to FHIR, I put up a free testing tool online for anyone to try CDA-FHIR conversion, identify issues, and discuss here in the community. As a starting point, it can convert sample CCD documents from HL7.  If your CDA document does not convert to your needs, you may let us know what's missing. We will try to fix it and let you know to try again.  Hopefully, this on-demand testing approach may help people with CCD and any other types of CDA documents. <br>\nTest your CDA-FHIR conversion here: <a href=\"https://web2express.org/hdoc\">https://web2express.org/hdoc</a></p>",
