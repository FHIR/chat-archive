The patient mapping defined in FHIR points to EntityNameUseR2 (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v3-EntityNameUseR2\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v3-EntityNameUseR2\">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v3-EntityNameUseR2</a>). And these is no ConceptMap defined for these two value set.</p>",

Alignment (documented concepMaps between value sets) is a MUST HAVE requirement given the large-scale production use of CDA today (as evidenced by the quantity of CDA documents exchanged within the Carequality and CommonWell networks--not to mention DirectTrust and SHIEC.</p>",

Some of the mappings won't be great because there's misalignment.  But if misalignment exists, it's generally intentional.  Everything done in FHIR had full awareness of conventions in v2 and v3, so if there's a difference, it was to align with FHIR design principles.</p>",
