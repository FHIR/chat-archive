We also need guidance where this property conflicts with an allergy status observation.</p>\n<p>Proposed Resolutions:<br>\nCF: If the Allergy - Intollerance.effectiveTime data is usually not present, use the Status Observation.value to populate the Allergy-Intolerance.clinicalStatus. Recommend additional guidance in the Companion Guide to make the relationship between clinical status and effectiveTime of the Allergy - Intollerance Observation.</p>\n<p>Alternative Proposal CF: Propose a change to Companion Guide:  Use Allergy - Intollerance/Status Observation as the first source of Allergy-Intolerance.clinicalStatus. If Status Observation not present and there is a Allergy-Intollerance.effectiveTime/high, set Allergy-Intolerance.clinicalStatus = resolved.</p>",
