We have a JSON Schema for it, but don't know how we can capture this in the profile. </p>\n<p>There is no such thing as valueObject to store free form objects (which is probably a good thing) so we were thinking about valueString.<br>\nWe could just stringify the JSON and put it there, but this feels a bit hacky.</p>\n<p>I think this comes down to the need for a custom complex type and then use valueOurCustomType in the extension.<br>\nThis does feel like diving into a rabbit hole ... so it's worth verifying our approach here before we try this.</p>\n<p>Any advise on how to tackle this?</p>\n<p>PS: We're pretty new to profiling (tbh this is the first one we are creating), so forgive me if i'm missing the obvious. :-)</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
