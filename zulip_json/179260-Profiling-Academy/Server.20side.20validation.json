I understand the part of how to constrain the resources, add extensions and how to build IG so it can be readable for human. Where I'm really struggling is after uploading SDs and IGs to the server, it seems that the server does not use those resources at all. In example I took vanilla Patient resource and changed cardinality on birthDate from 0...1 to 1...1. After that I decided to create instance of Patient resource but it seems server hasn't checked it against the IG/SD I uploaded earlier. I'm kind of lost about what I'm doing wrong or maybe I miss something about the whole process. If someone could spare a while to explain how it has to be done to actually work I would appreciate greatly.</p>",
