Its cardinality is (0,*). <br>\nA first profile, we call it profile 1, adds a constraint on this attribute : cardinality (1,*). <br>\nA second profile, based on profile 1, adds another constraint to the same attribute : cardinality (1,1). We call it profile 2. <br>\nProfile 2 is inherited from profile 1, which itself is inherited from the Observation resource. </p>\n<p>Our question is the following. We consider the  element \"category\" of the snapshot of profile 2. Should its  base.min be equal to 0 or 1 ? In other words, should the base of an inherited profile be the original resource, or the profile it is based on ? </p>\n<p>I hope my question is as clear as possible, please don't hesitate to ask if it is not. </p>\n<p>Thanks a lot for the feedback, </p>\n<p>Elsie</p>",
