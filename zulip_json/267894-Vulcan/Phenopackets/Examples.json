I saw this blog post (<a href=\"https://fhirblog.com/2014/08/08/creating-examples-in-fhir/\">https://fhirblog.com/2014/08/08/creating-examples-in-fhir/</a>), which appears interesting, but I am not sure how I would integrate that into the example code. Also, do I need to create XML, JSON, and Turtle versions of each example or is there some way to do that automatically?</p>",
