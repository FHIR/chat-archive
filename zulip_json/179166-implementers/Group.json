I happen to know what Entity.determinerCode is, so I think I know what it does, but that's a rather esoteric fact to know these days<br>\n- is quantity a definitional or descriptional aspect of a group?

We'd definitely want to add species as veterinary is a primary use-case<br>\n3. Don't understand.  Current model lets you say \"include males\" or \"exclude males\".  If you want to say \"include males\" + \"include other\", then you'd repeat characteristic twice.<br>\n4.

This differentiates \"Crate of chickens #5\" vs. \"All chickens within 5 miles of intersection XYZ\"<br>\n6. It depends on the value of the actual flag.  If you're defining a study group, you could say \"50 male mice between 6-9 months old\" with actual = false and have it be definitional.  Or you could say \"Test group A contained 48 male mice between 6-9 months old\" with actual = true and have it be descriptional<br>\n7. It means that you've defined the group by characteristics but identified the matching candidates - e.g. you've now figured out which chickens fell within the 5 mile radius</p>",
