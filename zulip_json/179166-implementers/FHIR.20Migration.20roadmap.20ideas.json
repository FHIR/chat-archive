I think there are some interresting things that can be learned from looking at this prior 'art'. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Ft7lU0E8EHSiw9AW2S7vL_0cGrFiNB-DMyZHT1NCSk/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Ft7lU0E8EHSiw9AW2S7vL_0cGrFiNB-DMyZHT1NCSk/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>",

Our approach is to try the new specifications during our national projectathon once a year and hope we get to the maturity that we can use then these specifications for the ordonnace, but we have to live with coexistencing standards in a few areas.</p>",

This is a headache case that is the source of many of questions here. V3 and <a href=\"http://Resource.id\">Resource.id</a> do not mix. Managing OIDs and URIs is a pain in the a**. The last couple of years we have consistently 'designed' our V3 efforts in tandem with our FHIR efforts because compatibility does not come for free. We will likely have V2/V3/CDA for 15 more years or so if our millions of Edifact messages  since 1989 are any sort of measure.</p>\n<p>We are also starting a broader vision on APIs with our ministry of health and several other partners. We currently do this use case by use case, and that serves us well on a per use case basis, but we experience how hard it is to find alignment between use cases and we recognize that there are infinitely more use cases than we will ever be able to work on. So we need smarter solutions going forward and we think the maturity in thinking about this, has the right momentum.</p>",
