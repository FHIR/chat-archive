Sure would be fantastic if the spec supported multiple \"security metadatas\" instead of one (eg: user vs system vs patient) -- for cases like mine where there is just one resource server, but multiple authorization endpoints.</p>\n<p>I am also trying to support dynamic registration.  I'm having trouble navigating this...  it seems that the idea is that the client finds out about the auth server via the metadata / well-known endpoints. How did the client find out about those endpoints??</p>\n<p>Curious if others have one client registration that works among its tenants, or are client credentials managed on a per tenant basis?</p>",
