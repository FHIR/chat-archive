So the user can set the graphic with differents ranges of times so for this reason I need implement the best effience way to draw this data in the graph in live, is important know that is for a global solution around the world.</p>\n<p>At this point also need return average calcs for the same graph with a very good time of response (perfomance), is a good idea use FHIR por all this topics? Eg: avg operations in the FHIR Server...return observations with summary function...</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

It has a number of capabilities to filter the resultset and to return calculated statistics.  Plus, if you have control over the relevant servers, you have the option of defining custom operations.  In terms of response times, it'll depend on the server and how much data you're going after.  It's hard to provide more guidance without knowing in more detail exactly what you're trying to do.</p>",
