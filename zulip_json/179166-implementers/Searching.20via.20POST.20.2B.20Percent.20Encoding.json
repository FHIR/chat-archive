Standard % escaping still applies, such that these URLs have the same meaning:\n\nGET [base]/ValueSet?url=http://acme.org/fhir/ValueSet/123,http://acme.org/fhir/ValueSet/124,125\nGET [base]/ValueSet?url=http://acme.org/fhir/ValueSet/123,http://acme.org/fhir/ValueSet/124%2CValueSet/125\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Does this equivalence also apply to <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>content in the body (when searching via POST)? E.g., should we accept <code>:</code> as a literal (even though it should be escaped based on the content type)?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>",
