        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"218656\">@Robin Bosman</span>, yes, this is correct.<br>\nFHIR introduces a set of special meta-data extensions for <code>StructureDefinition</code> and <code>ElementDefinition</code>, e.g. to specify custom binding constraints, as in your example. However the Forge UI does not yet support such meta-extensions; they are not visible in the UI, and the author cannot add or edit them. However you can add them to a profile by manually editing the XML/JSON. Simplifier rendering logic does not yet display such meta-extensions. The .NET profile validator also does not recognize/verify custom constraints expressed via meta-extensions. So the actual benefits of using such custom meta-extensions are currently still quite limited.</p>",
