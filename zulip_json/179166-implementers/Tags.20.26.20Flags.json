For example we might want to tag/flag patients that have taken part in a clinical trial, so we can easily re-identify them in the future to check on health outcomes. In the FHIR model there are many ways of doing this. For example you could <br>\n- Create a Group with the characteristic of being part of a trial<br>\n- Create a Flag to flag the patients who were in the trial<br>\n- Create a List of Patients that participated in the trial<br>\n- Use Patient.meta.tag to tag the patients of interest<br>\nIs there an accepted practice for flagging/tagging patients of interest?</p>",
