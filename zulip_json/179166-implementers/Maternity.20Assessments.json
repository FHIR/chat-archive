Examples - VTE assessment , Tissue Viability  etc.</p>\n<p>So far , I have seen 2 structures that come close :<br>\nClinical Assessment : <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2015Jan/clinicalassessment.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2015Jan/clinicalassessment.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/2015Jan/clinicalassessment.html</a><br>\nRisk Assessment : <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/riskassessment.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/riskassessment.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/riskassessment.html</a></p>\n<p>Am I in the right direction ? Also ,  I have seen a comment in Clinical Assessment link which says :</p>\n<p>There is another related clinical concept often called an \"assessment\": assessment Tools such as Apgar (also known as \"Assessment Scales\"), and this is different to the scope of the \"clinical assessment\" resource. Assessment tools such as Apgar are represented as Observations, and Questionnaires may be used to help generate these.</p>\n<p>Haven't found any link to \"Assessment\" mentioned above. I feel perhaps \"Assessment\" is the right structure since we are dealing with assessment scales like MEWS (Modified Early Warning Score or Modified Early Obstetric Warning Score). Is it possible to get a link to it or any guidance in this regard ?</p>\n<p>Thanks ! </p>",
