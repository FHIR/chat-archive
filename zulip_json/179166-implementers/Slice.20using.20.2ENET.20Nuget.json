        "content": "<p>Hi Jakob - \"slicing\" is something that is defined in \"profiles\" (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html</a>) - basically a FHIR definition mechanism for adding additional constraints and validations on top of the FHIR \"core\" resources.   In the C# implementation, the C# classes are generated from the \"core\" resources, not from these additional profiles, so there is no reflection of the slicing you might define in a profile in the generated C# classes.   Assuming you want to express your slices \"statically\", that is.</p>\n<p>I could also read your question as being about defining a set of criterion ad-hoc (in code here) and then running them \"live\" on an instance to group the contents of a list into sub-groups.  This is not possible <em>yet</em> but I am looking for ways for you to do this in code, instead of having to create a profile. This is however still in the early stages.  Ping me if you'd like to know more.</p>",
