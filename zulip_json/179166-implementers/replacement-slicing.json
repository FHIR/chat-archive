Instead it is fully replaced by a slice with<br>\n\"id\": \"FamilyMemberHistory.relationship:relationship\", and the modification \"mustSupport\": true (and sliceName and base)<br>\nWhy is this defined as a slice instead of just modifying the field and noting it in the differential?  is it valid to remove the base field like that (and therefore have slicing rules on a field with a slice)?</p>",
