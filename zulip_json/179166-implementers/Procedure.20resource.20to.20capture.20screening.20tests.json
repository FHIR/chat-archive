For example, I did not find snomed code for cervical cancer screening,prostate cancer screening test, gonorrhea screening test,lung cancer and  osteopenia. Also, there are many tests for a particular screening process. Which one should I pick the process or the test? If it is the process, there are no snomed codes for the above mentioned disorders. Is there any alternate code other than snomed code? Thanks in advance</p>",

If you are after a set of SNOMED CT concepts for ordering you could check out the Australian work on this, where they mandate SNOMED CT for orders, and have a process for creating new concepts in the Australian extension. <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/ncts/#/access\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/ncts/#/access\">https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/ncts/#/access</a>  Looks like you require an account on the Australian NCTS site for access now.
