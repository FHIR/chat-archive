Forge then renames the type slice to <code>valueQuantity</code> and allows you to put an extension on there.<br>\nNote that In R4, the <code>valueQuantity</code> type slice introduces specific constraints for Quantity values but does NOT constrain the list of allowed types. To actually disallow other types, constrain the types of the sliced <code>value[x]</code> parent element to only <code>Quantity</code>. Also note that Forge R4 will NOT rename the sliced <code>value[x]</code> parent element, even if constrained to a single type.</p>",
