In addition to having the proprietary raw data file I also want to convert the raw data to something non-proprietary, but keep the original raw data. Is there any guidance on how to best use the facilities of FHIR to express such a data structure? Should I create a Bundle containing 1. DocumentReference with attachment for the PDF, 2. a Binary for the proprietary raw data, and then 3. also incl. an Observation with the FHIR-based sample data and an interpretation? It seems SNOMED-CT has appropriate codes for the things that the AI could detect.</p>",

Only hesitation is the AI generated data, is this also contained in the PDF ? If the PDF doesn't contain it, could it then be said that the third expression is the same (in terms of information content) as the other two expressions ? (that's  a judgement call)</p>",

        "content": "<p>thanks for the ideas! I was starting out my thought process with the Observation, because the FHIR ECG example is based on Observation. Both the PDF and the proprietary raw data contain the AI result, so I think they are equivalent in content. I had not looked at DiagnosticReport before, that seems to be a good way to combine a few binary media objects and a \"conclusionCode\". I'm admittedly a bit hesitant with the FHIR ECG example, as numerous other formats seem to have a head-start when it comes to ECG storage (DICOM ECG, aECG, ISHNE, etc.).</p>",
