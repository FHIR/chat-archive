        "content": "<p>It may be helpful to think of FHIR as a 'foundation' for standards.  FHIR standardizes everything where there is consensus across its scope.  However, its scope is vast - inpatient, outpatient, veterinary, social services, public health, research, claims - in every country in the world.  As a result, there's a limit to what constraints can reasonably be imposed.  We can't say that <a href=\"http://Patient.name\">Patient.name</a> is mandatory when the patient might be a chicken, someone who arrives unconscious at the ER, or a record submitted as part of anonymized reporting.</p>\n<p>However, by defining the building blocks, the technical architectures for exchange, and the process for specifying constraints on the spec when it's used in specific contexts, FHIR drives considerable re-use and consistency and means that the starting point for discussions around interoperability in a particular healthcare discipline, a particular country, or some other context don't have to start from ground zero.  Furthermore, it greatly increases the likelihood that different implementers solving similar problems in different places will come up with solutions with a much better impedance match than they would if they'd simply written their own JSON schemas.</p>\n<p>The other key part of FHIR is the community (e.g. this forum) where, even in the absence of specific guidance in the FHIR core spec, implementers improve their alignment through talking about issues, searching to see what others have done, leveraging and aligning with the work of other IG creators, and providing feedback that evolves both the core spec and the IGs.</p>\n<p>FHIR is definitely not a panacea.  There is no guarantee that two systems defined completely independently  will share say \"drug prescription\" information out-of-the box.  Different choices will be made around drug codes or the level of detail in which to encode dosage.  One might choose messaging, another REST.  However, it's still going to be less work to get those systems to talk to each other than it would have been with HL7 v3, or even possibly HL7 v2.</p>",
