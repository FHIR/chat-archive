The Forge UI is not yet ready to let you create reslices. But if you manually edit the profile XML and add reslices (e.g. with slice names of the form \"other/XXX\"), then you should be able to open and edit the profile in Forge. We're planning to implement full support for re-slicing in Forge ASAP, but currently our main priority is to get STU3 release ready for the may WGM in Madrid.</p>",
