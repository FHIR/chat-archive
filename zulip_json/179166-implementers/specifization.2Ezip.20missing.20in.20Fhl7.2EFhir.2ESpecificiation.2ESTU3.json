Previously, we used an install script that ran after installation of the NuGet package, but this use has been deprecated by Microsoft &amp; the newer NuGet format (since 3.3) has support for explicit transitive includes.  This should improve the behaviour (in fact, the old behaviour is supposed to be completely broken now), but if you still encounter issues, we'll have to track down what's going on.</p>",
