What constitutes a distinct Condition instance vs. a change to an existing Condition instance is really a question of local business rules.  (Similarly, FHIR doesn't place rules one what sort of changes can be handled as updates to a prescription and which must be handled by cancelling the original order vs. creating a new one.)  From FHIR's perspective, if you want to update a Condition to change the patient, the author and change the Condition.code from lung cancer to diabetes, that's totally legitimate.  However, it's likely that any one of those changes, let alone all of them, will violate the business rules in many environments.</p>",
