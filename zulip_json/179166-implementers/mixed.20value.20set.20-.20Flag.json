Codes in the value set include the patient can meet up directly at the hospital instead the normal procedure of going through ER/GP; a special doctor should be contacted if something happens to the patient (to prevent ex ER to start some treatment on their own), or based on experience a special way of treatment (which is not the standard way) is recommended for the given patient.
