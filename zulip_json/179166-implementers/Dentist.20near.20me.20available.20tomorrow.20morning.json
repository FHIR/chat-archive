If you're deploying your own system to support this kind of thing, you'll want to document your modeling choices clearly, so clients can follow along.</p>",

Genesis of my query is the India's proposed national \"Unified Health Interface \"  UHI. It is envisioning to enable such services .  <br>\nI was exploring if we had to implement similar queries using FHIR how difficult and appropriate it would be.  <br>\nSince Consultation paper is out  for feedback and suggestions, I am evaluating the fitment of FHIR APIs in scheme of things. So that we can recommend use of FHIR APIs/services in UHI . </p>\n<p>See the consultation paper here :  <a href=\"https://ndhm.gov.in/publication/consultationpapers\">https://ndhm.gov.in/publication/consultationpapers</a></p>",
