One change that I do not understand  is that SearchParameter.Base has changed from a ResourceType to IEnumerable&lt;ResourceType?&gt;.  Could someone please explain the reason for this change?  I can't see any SearchParameter definitions that reference more than one Resource and I am not even sure what that would mean.  Also, is a null in the IEnumerable significant or does it just denote the absence of a value? i.e. is [Person, null] the same as [Person]?<br>\nThanks,<br>\nAndy</p>",
