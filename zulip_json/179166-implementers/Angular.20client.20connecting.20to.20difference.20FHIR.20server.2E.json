For example, Cerner server enforce conditional update. So I must add If-Match header. HSPC server doesn't allow conditional update. So I must remove If-Match header. These differences cause lots of if-else blocks in my code. And I don't even want to think about DSTU2 vs STU3.<br>\nI am just wondering, as a client implementer, how do you solve this problem?<br>\nThanks</p>",
