Learn about any potential solutions that translate FHIR and HL7 v2 messages which will allow me to focus on maximum dependency on FHIR based integration layer 4. Learn architecture patterns for hosting of my integration layers (FHIR server) in cloud and /or on-prem hosting  5. Any introductory / educational / certification sessions that speak for HIPAA and HiTrust</p>",

For 2 - 4 the connectathon is an option but can be rather overwhelming since the connectathon tracks are often at the very front of the development of FHIR itself. A better fit IMO is <a href=\"https://www.fhirdevdays.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.fhirdevdays.com/\">DevDays</a>. I haven't seen 5. as a separate topic on either - it is more generally applicable than just in the FHIR realm.<br>\nThat being said I definitely encourage you to go to the connectathon to see the breadth of FHIR and because you can contribute to the standard from your own experience. FHIR is not just a standard, it is also a community and the connectathon is a good place to become a part of it.</p>",
