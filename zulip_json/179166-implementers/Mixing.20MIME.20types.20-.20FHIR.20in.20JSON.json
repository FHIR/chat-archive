I've noticed that several \"FHIR touching\" (for lack of a better term) specifications define some sort of JSON envelope with (sometimes) a FHIR resource inside (e.g., <a href=\"https://cds-hooks.org/examples/\">CDS Hooks</a>, <a href=\"http://fhircast.org/events/imagingstudy-open/\">FHIRcast</a>, and current projects like FAST).</p>\n<p>How are people implementing this?</p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, developers tend towards FHIR libraries which require custom serializers and parsers (e.g., HAPI, Firely, etc.).  Also as far as I can tell, those libraries do not allow for generic parsing and serializing of objects (e.g., protocol XYZ envelope object).</p>\n<p>If people are not using FHIR libraries, <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/json.html\">FHIR JSON</a> has some differences (small, but <code>important!</code>) from standard JSON... Are these differences being accounted for?</p>\n<p>Any input would be appreciated, thanks!</p>",
