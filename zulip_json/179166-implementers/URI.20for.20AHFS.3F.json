        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194183\">@John Silva</span> Categorizing things is a complicated business and is driven by the use case. In addition for drugs, we need to decide if the focus will be substances which are easier to link and collect (think Active Ingredient), or products which can have MANY ingredients that restrict the therapeutic intent. I'm focused on substances but understand that means there are some very important outliers.  IMO there are three major use cases for drug category concepts: 1) grouping drugs by therapeutic intent so that clinicians can be presented a list of options once they have decided to treat.  2) Grouping drugs based on cross-reactivity to be used for substance avoidance. 3) Grouping drugs based on a common characteristic because you need to do some common thing across the group. Such as engage a CDS tool or find common clinical impacts. The work I'm involved with for opioid management is a good example of this last one. There are some big nasty issues in using terminological ontologies to represent these types of categories (particularly those for allergies) but all of these <em>REQUIRE</em> that the class concept be linked to a set of drug ingredients which can lead to orderables and products, and sometime drug products directly. This is not runtime stuff.</p>\n<p>If a clinician wants to use \"a drug class\" to say something about a particular drug they have ordered, then I wonder what they really want to accomplish. The mostly likely thing is they want to represent therapeutic intent <em>for that particular drug for that particular patient</em>. I wonder if that is in part what you are hearing. If so, then I'd strongly suggest capturing as therapeutic intent and using a condition with a likelihood or risk of or something to capture that the patient may not even have the thing yet (think vaccine or preventative care.)  I look forward to the discussion tomorrow or whenever. I have a conflict for the call but will try to be there.</p>\n<p>As for the SCT hierarchy you linked. It does not meet the criteria I see as needed: it does not link to actual products (and SCT will not do this because its hard, changes, and is realm-specific) and it looks likes lots of therapeutic intents to me which as I noted, can be useful for classifying but as such are fraught with maintenance issues. I'm more interested in using SCT for concepts like <a href=\"https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&amp;conceptId1=404642006&amp;edition=en-edition&amp;release=v20190131&amp;server=https://prod-browser-exten.ihtsdotools.org/api/snomed&amp;langRefset=900000000000509007\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&amp;conceptId1=404642006&amp;edition=en-edition&amp;release=v20190131&amp;server=https://prod-browser-exten.ihtsdotools.org/api/snomed&amp;langRefset=900000000000509007\">Substance with opioid receptor agonist mechanism of action (substance)</a> but finding all of them simply is a challenge.</p>",

You could argue that this should be associated with the Medication, but if that is from the 'formulary' then it might not work because a specific drug, in a specific use (admin) is being used at that point for a specific therapeutic reason.  I'm a technologist, not a clinician,  but I believe drugs have (or can have) multiple therapeutic uses, so I imagine these multiples being associated with the Medication.

Because the base FHIR specification is not intended to support every single use case from every single implementation.  That was the downfall of v3, and to a lesser extent, one of the criticisms of v2.  The extension mechanism in FHIR is a normal means of supporting specific use cases and is, in fact, how FHIR tends to support most use cases.   As I mentioned in my earlier answer, that is why we need to have implementer feedback to see if anyone supports categorization of the <em>administration</em> in general and if they support multiple categorizations specifically.</p>",

It is conceivable that the prescriber could indicate the order is for both inpatient and discharge, or that the medication (e.g., an single-dose antibiotic) can be administered in a clinic, at a pharmacy, or in another community setting.  In both cases, multiple category entries allow for the option of multiple \"types.\"</li>\n<li><strong>MedAdmin.category</strong>, on the other hand, indicates where the medication was/will be administered or consumed.  (\"will be\" is necessary if MedAdmin.status is not \"completed\".)  There may be multiple \"categories\" in the MedRequest, but there can only be one in the MedAdmin.  For the single-dose antibiotic example, the administration will occur in one place.</li>\n</ul>",
