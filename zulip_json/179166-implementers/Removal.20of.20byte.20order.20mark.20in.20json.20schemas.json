The schema files contain a byte order mark (BOM), which can also be seen as &lt;U+FEFF&gt; in some editors. Unfortunately the BOM makes the json validators fail because the BOM is not part of the json spec. I have made my system work by manually removing the BOM, but this can cause errors later on if the schema files are changed and the person who does that has no knowledge of the BOM.<br>\nWould it be possible to remove the BOM from json schema files in the future, or is there a reason for its inclusion?</p>",
