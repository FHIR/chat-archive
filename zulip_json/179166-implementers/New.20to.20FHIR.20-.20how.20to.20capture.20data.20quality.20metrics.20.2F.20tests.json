Not specifically clinical quality measures, but more like frequency distribution of values in a  field in an RDBMS (not from an EHR directly, but as part of projects interested in the  secondary use of EHR data) - examples: distribution of Race values in a data set and data completeness. <br>\nI've seen a few resources related to medical device measures but wanted to see if anyone in the community had any thoughts or experience in this area? Thanks very much!</p>",

So Measure to capture the test (e.g. completeness test) and MeasureReport to capture the result ( e.g. # of missing values for a specific field in a table).</p>",
