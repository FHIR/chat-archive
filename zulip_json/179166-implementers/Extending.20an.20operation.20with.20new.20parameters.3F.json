However, the details for Observation.base say \"Indicates that this operation definition is a constraining profile on the base\" and \"A constrained profile can make optional parameters required or not used and clarify documentation\" which sounds like 1) new parameters are not allowed and 2) if new parameters were added, they could not add additional functionality.  Is that really the case or is that documentation out of date?</p>",
