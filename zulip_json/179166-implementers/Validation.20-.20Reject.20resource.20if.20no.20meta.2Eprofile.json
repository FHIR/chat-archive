We have loaded our own StructureDefinitions into the PrePopulatedValidationSupport and want to only validate against these. This works if the resource contains a profile-url in meta.profile. But if the client does not provide a meta.profile-url, they can get around validating against our provided StructureDefinitions. </p>\n<p>Is it possible with HAPI (or the validator) to reject any resource that does not conform to our provided StructureDefinitions?</p>",
