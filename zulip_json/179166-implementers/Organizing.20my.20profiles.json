We have clinical parameters like, Body weight, birth weight, mother weight, father weight. They all have different snomed ct codes.  All these are except the body weight are one time parameters. (patient has only one registration ideally) Birth weight is measured in grams. Most of the time body weight is measured in Kilo grams. But there are incidents where gram is also used.  mother weight, father weight are always given in Kgs.  Only Body weight has an additional attribute called, State of dress ( whether the patient is naked, half dressed, with shoes, etc)   When creating profiles to above parameters what is the best approach ?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create individual profiles for each parameter ?</li>\n<li>Create one profile for all of these and add the code using a value set ?</li>\n<li>Create a WeightCore profile without specifying any code. Create 2 derived profiles using the core profile eg: WeightLIte profile &amp; WeightRelative.  WeightLite has a value set as the code and support both Birth weight and Body weight. WeightRelative has a value set including the codes of father weight and mother weight.</li>\n</ol>",

There is no link to parents medical records to get those values. Staff just enters those values in Child's medical record as measurements of Parents.  Now I'm creating profiles for weight of biological mother, Weight of biological father and  etc. When creating observation profiles can we use the standard vital sign profile of FHIR to derive my profiles  ? I have this concern because these are not vital signs of  the patient, but his parents.</p>",

Currently LOINC is the preferred coding system, so to follow the spirit of the vitals sign profile you could try and use the LOINC codes for 'Weight of the biological father/mother' if LOINC equivalents exist. If not, you can extend the value set with SNOMED codes.</p>",
