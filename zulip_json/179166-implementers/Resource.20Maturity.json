I would say that Consent has mostly met FMM 2. It has been a part of FHIR Connectathons for almost 2 years. I think the thing holding it back is the statement in FMM 2 that it has been tested with 80% of scope. Due to the added scope beyond the intent of CBCP of Privacy. The adding the other types of Consent has been very hard to model,  As we have not even seen these use-cases brought to committee. There is some work on Research Consent, but even that space has been hard going. Consent has well established Privacy Consent coverage. So if we could remove these other consents from the scope, we could likely go much higher in FMM. Until then we are at the mercy of the experts in these other kinds of Consent.</p>",
