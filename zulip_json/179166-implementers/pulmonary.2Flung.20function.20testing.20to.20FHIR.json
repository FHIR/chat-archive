We came up with the following options:<br>\n1) Using Observations for each LFT parameter (directly linked to the DiagnosticReport). Link Observations with a Procedure (coded either in LOINC or SNOMED CT for the section, e.g. \"Spirometry (procedure) | SCTID: 127783003\").<br>\n2) Using Observations with components. Coding an observation directly in LOINC or SNOMED CT for the section, e.g. \"Spirometry (procedure) | SCTID: 127783003\", and have the measured values/parameters in the \"components\". <br>\n(We are aware of the detailed notes and recommendations at the FHIR-Observation website for when to use components or not. A single value may be interpreted without the others, but some values may also depend and interrelate to each other)<br>\n3) we also considered to use 2 levels of Observations using the hasMember-property, e.g. having Observations for the LFT sections (at 1. level) and use the hasMember property to create observations for the LFT parameters/values (at 2. level).</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/XAIntXoQTQIYm7HjIiKpp3rJ/lufu_fhir_1.jpeg\" title=\"lufu_fhir_1.jpeg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/XAIntXoQTQIYm7HjIiKpp3rJ/lufu_fhir_1.jpeg\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/M17Gs8JR5saDuA618XU2eSzy/lufu_fhir_2.jpeg\" title=\"lufu_fhir_2.jpeg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/M17Gs8JR5saDuA618XU2eSzy/lufu_fhir_2.jpeg\"></a></div><p>As additional information, there is a LOINC mapping for the PFT/LFT panels available (<a href=\"https://loinc.org/81458-2/\">https://loinc.org/81458-2/</a>). <br>\nWe use many of the LOINC codes for the actual parameter coding (in observation / component). <br>\nWe have found though that some codes do not reflect our understanding or are not complete for our purpose, so we only use them where applicable.</p>\n<p>Any comments or support on which approach to choose over the other is highly appreciated. We had several discussions, decided for 2) a last, <br>\nand it would be great to have your feedback.</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nJan</p>",

On this page are some example reports as they are produced (menu on the left e.g. for \"obstruction\" shows the case with pre- and post-values): <a href=\"http://lungfunction.net/interpretation/normal-findings.htm\">http://lungfunction.net/interpretation/normal-findings.htm</a>. At some point I also wasn't sure if this sort of \"mapping these sections\" does make sense at all. And wether the very first (and simplest) approach could be just enough. Especially in terms of using the data later on for analytics.</p>",
