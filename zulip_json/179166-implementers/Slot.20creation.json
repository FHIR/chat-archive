Whether you accomplish this by creating a full set of static open slots for the next 12 months, or whether you support this 'dynamically' (i.e. responding with open slots that don't even exist yet, vaporware slots, that are only really instantiated if their status goes to anything other than open) is entirely up to a server. The advantage of 'dynamic' slots is that if someone were to go for an appointment which has a non-standard duration, you could simply instantiate a slot for the requested duration. There are probably other ways of doing this as well.</p>",
