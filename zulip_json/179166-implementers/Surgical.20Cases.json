There is one surgical case (i.e. one visit to the OR) with multiple procedures performed on various injured body parts while under anesthesia.</p>\n<p>Option 1:  Use <strong>EpisodeOfCare </strong>where the individual procedures have both an encounter + episode of care reference<br>\nOption 2:  Use <strong>Encounter </strong>(which is part of a larger inpatient Encounter, for example).  The individual procedures would only reference the surgical encounter / case (and the surgical encounter / case is part of the inpatient encounter).<br>\nOption 3:  Use <strong>Procedure </strong>where the individual procedures are “part of” a larger procedure (but there is no procedure.code for the case – the case would have an identifier/case number)</p>\n<p>As a side note, regardless of which Option is preferred, we have multiple time periods captured at the case level (whereas the aforementioned resources basically have a single period).  For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anesthesia period.  We ruled out using MedAdmin for a couple reasons.  First, anesthesia period differs from med admin dates in that the anesthesia period represents the time that is charged by the facility, which is when anesthesia comes into the room with the patient until they have transferred care to the nurse in PACU.  Second, there could be multiple anesthesia methods used within the case (e.g. case starts with an Epidural for a Caesarean Section and then in that same surgical case the patient transitions to General Anesthetic for a Hysterectomy)  </li>\n<li>Surgery period.  Surgery start is the incision / scope entering body for the first procedure whereas end is closure / scope removed of last procedure.</li>\n</ul>",

Those timestamps can include \"Patient arrived in OP room\", \"Patient left OP Room\", \"Cut\", \"Suture\", ... but also timestamps regarding anesthesias, as can be seen in a recommendation paper I linked from the German VOPM:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/81ciaB9rVc53iJplxNqkbUbX/image.png\">image.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/81ciaB9rVc53iJplxNqkbUbX/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/81ciaB9rVc53iJplxNqkbUbX/image.png\"></a></div><p>I would therefore interpret the flow (very simplified) as of now like so:</p>\n<p>A patient is arriving in the hospital. A doctor is doing a diagnosis and documenting this in a Condition. If necessary an operation has to take place, so the doctor is requesting this via a ServiceRequest, where he also documents the code, of what has to be done on the patient. </p>\n<p>Example: 160007     Removal of foreign body of tendon and/or tendon sheath</p>\n<p>An Appointment is created to terminate the following Procedure. On the day of the Appointment the ServiceRequest is then filled by a Procedure, which completes the ServiceRequest and carries out the code 160007. While carrying out this code though, a few steps are necessary, which are the timestamps, which should in my opinion be documented in the procedure. This includes the duration of the anesthesia.</p>\n<p>I would find it very problematic, to create a huge number of procedures, for one code that should be carried out, only to document, that a procedure had a number of phases --&gt; timestamps. Imagine a procedure with a very thorough documentation of up to 36 timestamps....</p>\n<p>FYI: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191450\">@Simone Heckmann</span>  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191451\">@Patrick Werner</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"251639\">@Stephan Sommer-Schulz</span></p>",
