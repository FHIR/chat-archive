While the portal will be available beyond this week, the ability to register as an Okta trusted developer so you can request access tokens for use with the API calls to ~7000 synthetic veterans (and growing)  may only be open to all this week. Once you are a registered with Okta, you will be able to request tokens beyond this week. Visit the Getting Started page on the portal for more details. I will be upstairs on the mezzanine from 10-11 today to answer any questions. If you can't find me, you can reach me at 321-272-9516.</p>",
