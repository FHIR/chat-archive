I’m looking for and evaluating projects that transform HL7v2 to FHIR.</p>\n<p>I’m aware of the 2-to-FHIR project (<a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/OO/2-To-FHIR+Project\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/OO/2-To-FHIR+Project</a>.) It seems like it is more about the mappings, rather than an engine that actually does transforms.<br>\nI see the 2-to-FHIR code in GIT (<a href=\"https://github.com/HL7/v2-to-fhir\">https://github.com/HL7/v2-to-fhir</a>) which looks like it might do conversions, but I can’t see how you would run it. Is there any engine which uses the mappings in this repo to actually do transforms? Or are these just specifications and tooling.</p>\n<p>There is Microsoft’s FHIR-Converter conversion engine. (<a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter\">https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter</a>) This seems to be relatively complete for a few messages, and has a lot of resources defined.  I’m perplexed at the two major branches: the original Handlebars+Node.js, and the more recent Liquid+.NET. I can’t figure out the move to .NET (other than it’s MS).  It seems to me Node.js is a more common platform.</p>\n<p>There is LinuxForHealth hl7v2-fhir-converter (<a href=\"https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/hl7v2-fhir-converter\">https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/hl7v2-fhir-converter</a>). Java based, with YAML templates. Handles four V2 messages.</p>\n<p>HAPI has v2 parsing and validation as well as FHIR validation, but I don’t see any converters there.</p>\n<p>Is there any other v2 to FHIR open source library / engine that I’m missing?</p>",
