I am currently building the FHIR bundle in C# code using this library and am trying to figure out how to build the race part of the patient demographics.

If there is a better way to transform CDA to FHIR than doing it in code I would be interested in knowing about it. It seems like a common scenario. Thanks.<br>\nMiguel.</p>",
