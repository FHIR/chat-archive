Is there any way to make SAML work with FHIR, by passing on the SAML assertion tokens to FHIR? or perhaps an abstracted way of generating an OAuth2 token from SAML assertion that is created using Athena Health id, secret pair? One of the OAuth2 profiles has a way to form an OAuth2 token acceptable by the Reliable Party from the SAML assertion. Did anyone from this group try this out to support SAML with FHIR?</p>",
