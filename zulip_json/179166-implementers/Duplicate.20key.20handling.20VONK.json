During processing these messages, I am getting errors as I'm referring in all bundles to the same organization. In the logging, I can see the issue is caused by a duplicate key inserting in the vonk.entry table. I see this behavior for the Organization resource and Practitioner resource, which makes sense as those are recurring FHIR resources. </p>\n<p>In the case I process bundle by bundle manually, the bundle is accepted without any problem. So no error message is reported related to the existence of a duplicate key, referencing to an Organization and Practitioner FHIR resources.</p>\n<p>I already changed the VONK repository from SQLite to SQL, but the problem remains.<br>\nBecause I can process FHIR bundles one by one manually, the content of the bundle seems to be fine. Unfortunately, processing multiple bundles in batch (+-70) introduces some errors.</p>\n<p>Is it possible in VONK to manage somewhere this behavior?</p>\n<p>Kind regards,<br>\nWerner</p>",
