You either need to craft a process that restricts the valueset of the noted codes to only those that describe \"after event\" timing, then only allow positive offests, and the same for the \"before event\" codes with a negative offset. Or you can allow either positive or negative offsets and restrict the timing concepts to those that only describe the event without a timing element added. You can't do what Lloyd suggested where you get to ignore the timing element of the concept while using the event part. That would be like using the concept \"Acute renal failure\" for any type of renal failure and adding the chonicity into some other attribute. You get the picture - No bueno! While I like the code system (latin - I'm a doc and all) if you chose to represent the timing part via the offset +/- and the event alone, I'd suggest a different set of concepts as these latin phrases are really used as timing+event ideas - no one alive would refer to a meal as \"cibus\". </p>",

While it might be slightly weird to say \"do something 10 minutes before the end of lunch\" and extremely weird to say \"do something 2 hours before the end of lunch\", the meaning of it is clear - and I don't think we're abusing the terminology in any way by doing so.  The offset needs to be able to be negative to support reasonable requirements.  The fact it enables \"weird\" requirements can be addressed through usage notes, but shouldn't prevent us from meeting the reasonable use-cases.</p>",
