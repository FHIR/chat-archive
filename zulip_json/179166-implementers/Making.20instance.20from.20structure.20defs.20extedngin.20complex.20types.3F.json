It was an instance of this that I am looking to make in XML, however are you saying that it is invalid to produce such a structure definition? This is an example of such one: <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/ELabNetwork/Coding2\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://simplifier.net/ELabNetwork/Coding2\">https://simplifier.net/ELabNetwork/Coding2</a></p>",

Technically, extensions aren't really extending - they're slicing - and thus constraining - the existing generic extension element that's present in the base data type.</p>",
