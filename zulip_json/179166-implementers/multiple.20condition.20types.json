        "content": "<p>Social history is more a status for observations than conditions.  \"chief complaint\" is a relationship of a Condition or Observation to a particular Encounter or Claim, not something that's intrinsic to the Condition or Operation itself.  Similarly, Reaction is something that's asserting a relationship between a Condition and a medication or some other intervention and would typically be captured by linking from AllergyIntolerance or AdverseEvent.  CognitiveStatus and FunctionalStatus are categories that can apply to observations. I suppose you could use them in Condition.category as well if you wanted.  'problem' and 'diagnosis' are already existing category codes.</p>",
