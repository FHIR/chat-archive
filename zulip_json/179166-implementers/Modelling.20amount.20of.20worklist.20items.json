Suspicious measurements 3. ECGs 4. Overdue tasks (i.e. \"Call a patient\") 5. Especially observed patients  --&gt; We would like to implement a FHIR interface in order to send those data to other systems. Could you give a us a hint which resource types would fit best for that? We already considered \"ServiceRequest\" and \"Task\" for that but haven't figured out how to combine these resource types with search parameters. We want to send the amount of items per worklist only, not the actual content. Thanks for any help.
