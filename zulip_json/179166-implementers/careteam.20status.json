I am looking at the spec, here (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-careteam.html#mandatory-search-parameters\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-careteam.html#mandatory-search-parameters</a>), which states:</p>\n<p>\"SHALL support searching using the combination of the patient and status search parameters\"</p>\n<p>But property 'status' has cardinality 0..1 (it is flagged as Must Support, but I take this to mean that the property does not need to be populated if the data is not available).</p>\n<p>So the question is, how is this intended to work (i.e., a search must be supported for data that does not need to be present)? Would allowing the search (i.e., do not return an error) but returning no results suffice?</p>",
