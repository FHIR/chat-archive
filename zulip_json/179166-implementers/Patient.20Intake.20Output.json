P.o., i.v. etc. are the methods how the substance is given to the patient. For that, you have MedicationAdministration.route and if you use SNOMED (which is a question of license) you may also use the example value set, which means \"47625008\" for i.v. or \"26643006\" for p.o. and so on.</p>\n<p>Output in the sense of the examples you mentioned would be represented in an Observation, e.g. as a code for a symptome (like \"Diarrhea\" or \"Blood in urine\") or posssibly a quantity (like in quantity of urine)</p>",
