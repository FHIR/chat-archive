The proposed name changes would be:  <br>\n'Revoked' would be used instead of 'Cancelled'.   Rationale for change:  Revoked is generic and does not distinguish between whether the Order was actually started.  In some systems it is important to just state the order is not to be carried out and it doesn't matter ( or is unknown)  whether the order has started.  </p>\n<p>1.Another issue to be discussed separately is that in other systems it is important to distinguish between Cancelled e.g. with my Pharmacy hat on, the use of cancelled would mean the order is cancelled prior to any administrations occurring; and Stopped e.g. with my Pharmacy hat on, the use of stopped would mean the order is stopped at some time after  'some' administrations have occurred.  </p>\n<p>2.On-Hold would be used instead of Suspended</p>\n<p>1.Rationale for change:  On-Hold is the more common name in use.  </p>\n<p>1.Are there any concerns if Workflow renames Aborted and Suspended in the Event.status value set.

Bottom line from a committers perspective is we map them to set of statuses in the build which I don't think is aligned to workflow statuses.  It would be nice if the workflow statuses were aligned there.</p>",

The question John is asking whether \"on-hold\" would be a better name than \"suspended\".  On our call, I thought the proposal around stopped/cancelled for orders was to use \"revoked\" as the general term and pharmacy would add the notions of \"cancelled\" and \"stopped\" but those wouldn't be for general use because they require knowledge of the state of the event, which the authorization generally shouldn't have.</p>",

On the workflow call we suggested that Pharmacy see whether they cared about any of the other Task statuses and whether it might be better to have a contained Task within the order if there's a need to convey significant information about workflow state.  However, if the determination is that they only need \"cancelled\" and \"stopped\", that it's legitimate for them to add those - they would both map to the \"revoked\" request state.  </p>\n<p>We can't treat adherence to the workflow patterns as having higher priority than meeting business needs - though when there's a need to diverge, that should be discussed with the workflow group to make sure there's an understanding of the requirement and to see if we can find a way to meet the need <em>and</em> align.</p>",
