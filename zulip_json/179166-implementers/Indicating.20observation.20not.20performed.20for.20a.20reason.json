Current R4 Observation modeling uses a specific Observation.status value set which is different from the Event.status value set.

Resources such as Procedure allow a .status = not-done and statusReason for indication of rationale for not performing the procedure.  For the QI-Core implementation guide ballot reconciliation I am seeking advice about whether to consider Observation with an extension to address not-done status or if Procedure.status is more appropriate.

My preference is to avoid insistence of a value for Observation.value.<br>\n2.a.) If we must value the Observation.value, we would need to value the \"result\" for all of the QI-Core/FHIR resource profiles that enable \"not performed for reason\" - that includes MedicationRequest, MedicationAdministered, Observation, Procedure, Communication, ServiceRequest, Communication.
