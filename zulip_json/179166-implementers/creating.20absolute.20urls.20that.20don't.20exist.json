So for example: <a href=\"http://example.com/fhir/Patient/123\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://example.com/fhir/Patient/123\">http://example.com/fhir/Patient/123</a> does not exist, but I want to create the Document Reference record. I would have thought it would be possible to create a Document Reference using this absolute URL. Is there any way to achieve this?</p>",
