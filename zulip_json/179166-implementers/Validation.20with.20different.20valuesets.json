I'm looking into just replacing a ValueSet with a new ValueSet.  I'm thinking that I need to understand two different approaches.  One, to use my own ValueSet and the other to just use an different published ValueSet (ie., administrative-identity -&gt; gender-identify for Patient.Gender)</p>\n<p>So far, I've copied profiles.resources.xml onto my classpath and modified is so that gender-identity is specified instead of administrative-gender.  But that doesn't seem to change anything in the behavior of the validation.</p>\n<p>Can anyone help point me in the right direction?</p>",
