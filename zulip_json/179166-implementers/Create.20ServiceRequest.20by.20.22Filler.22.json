Because we did not receive any ServiceRequest - we do not have any ID from a requesting system.<br>\nIf we want to send this observation back to HIS/EMR an ID (HL7V2 \"Placer Id\") for the this observation/service is required, which should be generated by HIS/EMR.</p>\n<p>Are there any tpyical Profiles/Scenario defined?
