We have a requirement of displaying medication schedule for specific times of day for a period of days/weeks. </p>\n<p>For example - Take 1 tablet three times daily( 1 at breakfast, 1 at noon, 1 before dinner ) starting November 23, 2016</p>\n<p>Looking at the repeat section in the Timing datatype, It looks like representing something like this is not possible at the moment. Has anyone represented schedule into a MedicationStatement or MedicationOrder? Would an extension be good for this? </p>\n<p>We want something along these lines?
