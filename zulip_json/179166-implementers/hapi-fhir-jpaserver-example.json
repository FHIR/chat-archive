How is upgrading supposed to work? </p>",

I'd assume it's either that another instance still running or possibly a non-clean shutdown.</p>\n<p>You could try deleting the .lck files from the Derby directory to force it to start.. That said, HAPI FHIR 1.5 has a bunch of database column and index changes/improvements in it. Derby is kind of a pain to migrate databses in, so it might be easier to just wipe the whole directory when you upgrade to 1.5 and repopulate the Derby DB.</p>",
