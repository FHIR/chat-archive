But in data aggregation scenarios there's a distinct desire to know when data are <em>stale</em>, e.g. with something like a <code>currentAsOf</code> extension, so even data that hasn't changed could be marked with the time they were last refreshed by the aggregator from primary sources. <a href=\"https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/smart-scheduling-links/issues/16#issuecomment-799954590\">https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/smart-scheduling-links/issues/16#issuecomment-799954590</a> has an example.</p>\n<p>But... If an aggregator actually populated this extension it'd be <em>causing</em> an update, and presumably Meta.lastUpdated would tick up because of this. On this evaluation, it seems fine for aggregators to just skip the currentAsOf extension and repopulate lastUpdated as $now each time they refresh content.</p>\n<p>Anybody have a different take?</p>",
