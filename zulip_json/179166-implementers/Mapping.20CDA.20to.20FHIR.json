However, I see the value set of Encounter.diagnosis.use are very different (it has Preferred type):<br>\nAD Admission diagnosis <br>\nDD Discharge diagnosis <br>\nCC Chief complaint <br>\nCM Comorbidity diagnosis <br>\npre-op pre-op diagnosis <br>\npost-op post-op diagnosis <br>\nbilling Billing<br>\nDo you think Primary and Differential type will fit here? Please let me know what are your thoughts on this?</p>",

Sorry for the confusion, so for example if radiologist concluded that a patient has a primary diagnosis and few of the secondary diagnosis, I guess encounter.diagnosis.rank will cover this concept (with primary diagnosis ranked as 1 and subsequent rankings for the secondary diagnosis..)</p>",

A differential diagnosis can be the primary diagnosis for an encounter.  Differential just indicates that it's a candidate diagnosis that hasn't yet been ruled out or confirmed.</p>",
