This seems like a \"Please do my homework for me\" sort of question.  Please spend some time reviewing the FHIR spec, particularly the page that lists the available resources and some of the domain overview sections.  The mappings for several of your concepts should jump out at you as pretty obvious at a quick glance.  Several of the others will only take a bit of reading/digging.</p>\n<p>If, after reading through the section overviews and looking at the available resources in the relevant categories and reading their descriptions you're still having trouble mapping a few of them, feel free to re-post here and tell us what you've done and what options you're considering and we'd be happy to provide guidance.  (It may also be helpful to provide a description of what the concepts you're mapping are defined as and what sort of data you capture for them.  The same name can mean different things to different people and can potentially map to different places depending on how the name is being used.)</p>",
