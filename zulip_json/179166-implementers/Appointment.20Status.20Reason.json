In our usecase there are valid reasons like 'The Patient is Hospitalized', 'Patient transferred to another service provider', 'Personal Emergency' etc... There are few Resources that have a statusreason (like Goal) attribute to document this. Can we propose a similar attribute for Appointment as well?</p>",
