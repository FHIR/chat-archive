As well, sometimes the choices aren't codes, but are things like numbers and dates and there's a desire to retain those data types.  I understand that two ways to do the same thing adds complexity and it's possible we'll change it again once we have more implementer feedback, but that's the reason it exists as it does now.</p>",
