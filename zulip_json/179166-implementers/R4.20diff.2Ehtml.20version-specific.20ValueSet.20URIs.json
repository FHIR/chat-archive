Is there an expectation that all R4 and later profiles and resource instances use version-specific ValueSet and CodeSystem and StructureDefinition URIs now? What was the reasoning for adding version-specificity to the diff.html, and what are the potential implications of this?</p>\n<p>For example, \"Address.use: Change value set from <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/address-use\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/address-use\">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/address-use</a> to <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/address-use|4.0.0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/address-use|4.0.0\">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/address-use|4.0.0</a>\". Will all future release notes/diffs need to reflect the new release version then, e.g. <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/address-use|5.0.0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/address-use|5.0.0\">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/address-use|5.0.0</a> or even <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/address-use|4.1.0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/address-use|4.1.0\">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/address-use|4.1.0</a>, etc?</p>\n<p>Thanks for any insight you can provide!</p>",
