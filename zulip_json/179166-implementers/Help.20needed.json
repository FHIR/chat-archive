I just wrote a piece of c# to check if a Resource conforms to a particular stucture definition: </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>        public static bool ConformsTo(DomainResource resource, FhirUri uri)\n        {\n            if (resource?.Meta != null)\n                foreach (string p in resource.Meta.Profile)\n                    if (p == uri.Value)\n                        return true;\n\n            Log(EnumLogType.Warning, $&quot;Resource doesn&#39;t conforms to {uri.Value}&quot;);\n\n            return false;\n        }\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I use this to check if an organisation conforms to : <a href=\"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-organization\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-organization\">http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-organization</a></p>\n<p>This works but I also want to check if a particular Address resource conforms to: <a href=\"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-address\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-address\">http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-address</a></p>\n<p>The problem is: Address doesn't have a Meta parameter to check. Is there an other way to do this?</p>",
