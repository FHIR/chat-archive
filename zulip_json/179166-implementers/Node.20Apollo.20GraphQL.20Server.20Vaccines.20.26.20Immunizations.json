In so doing, I have a back-end server that relies on the NodeJS and Apollo Server Express. I am using express to store session data, but I'm not sure this is the best workflow. Moreover, I am not sure what would be the best way for patients to connect to their FHIR Smart Card profile. <br>\nI'm sorry if these are obvious questions, but I can't seem to find guides for integration, or where to even begin finding a smart card provider. <br>\nIdeally, the clients would simply sign on to our app, and we would determine what their patient Id is, and fetch their immunization and vaccine records.<br>\nAny help is appreciated. <br>\nThanks in advance!</p>",
