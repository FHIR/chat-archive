This is the culmination of a lot of work by many of us, and it's now completely possible for any other server to do the same<br>\n- if you want updated java code (see other thread about the java reference implementatoin) or updated pascal code, you can get them from my server rather than the formal frozen copy. HAPI and DotNet users etc will have to wait for the maintainers to update their releases accordingly (though they may not be affected by changes only to the expressions).</p>\n<p>this means that the technical base for the reference implementations is different to the official version on which the connectathon is based. The *only* differences are in the expressions, and a couple of fixes I made to XPath statements as I went. The structures, value sets, profiles etc and the narrative is the same, and the expressions have only been changed to match the intent of the official version. Any questions, feel free to ask</p>",
