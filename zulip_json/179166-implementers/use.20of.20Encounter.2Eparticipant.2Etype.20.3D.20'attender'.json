Clinicians often distinguish between an \"attending physician\" and a \"supervising physician\" as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Attending physician - A provider who may oversee care provided by medical residents (physicians in training). Can sometimes be referred to as a faculty physician.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Supervising physician - A provider who is responsible for overseeing care provided by non-physician ordering providers (e.g. NPs and PAs).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Which code in the encounter-participant-type value set is most appropriate for each of these scenarios? I was leaning towards using ATND (\"attender\") for both, but I wasn't sure if there was a more appropriate code to distinguish between these clinical scenarios.
