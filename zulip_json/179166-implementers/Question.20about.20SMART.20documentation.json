        "content": "<p>Thanks Josh! Is it correct to say SMART is primarily authentication/authorization and is not so much concerned with the content of what information is sent between the server and the client.  SMART on FHIR uses SMART for authentication/authorization and FHIR for messages sent by both the client and the server.  I would imagine that there are also hybrid solutions where the client sends a FHIR message and the server returns content that can be directly rendered by the client (e.g. HTML5).  Is this correct?</p>",

        "content": "<p>It sounds like I somewhat conflated Smart with CDS Hooks.  Also, it looks like neither of these are suited to our use case.  We have an existing web application that is called from an EHR.  The EHR currently just opens the url in a browser.  We would like to integrate the existing web page directly into the application.  It sounds like the easiest way to implement that would be to simply open the web app in a native widget for displaying html in the EHR (e.g. Java) using something like OAuth for authentication.  Is there something that FHIR/CDS Hooks/Smart would improve upon this type of solution (with out having to rewrite the entire existing web application to use FHIR messaging)?</p>",
