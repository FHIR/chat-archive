This is currently taken from \"Include codes from <a href=\"http://snomed.info/sct\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://snomed.info/sct\">http://snomed.info/sct</a>  where concept is-a 404684003 (Clinical finding) and is generated 19 Apr 2017. \"  If I was to make this value set binding = \"required\" does this mean that only codes contained within the value set would be included in a message?  If I didn't make this value set binding \"required\" does that mean the message could still be sent even in the absence of any (SNOMED CT) codes?  Can I change the contents of the value set and control them myself?  I'm concerned at how quickly out of date value sets such as these might become as SNOMED CT updates (e.g. inactive codes no longer in the active hierarchy).  Thanks in advance for any guidance.</p>",

(You'd be free to include ICD9, ICD10 and other codes as translations too if you wanted.)  The allowed set of codes would evolve as SNOMED CT evolved.  Validation of legacy data would need to take into account codes that were once valid but had since been retired.</p>\n<p>If the binding strength was \"extensible\", then you'd be expected to use a SNOMED code from the value set if one applied.  However, you'd be free to send just text or some other code if none of the SNOMED codes could cover the concept.</p>\n<p>If the binding strength was \"preferred\" or \"example\", you could send whatever you liked.</p>",
