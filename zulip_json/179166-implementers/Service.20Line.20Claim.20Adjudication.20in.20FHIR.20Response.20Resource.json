There are two elements in Claim Response resource - item and another is addItem. Both providing adjudication elements. addItem also provides way to write service line item code (Procedure code) and original fee for this service. Same is not available in item. Definition of addItem says- Insurer added line items. Not clear what it is. Could someone guide difference in these two elements and which one to chose for writing service line amount adjudication data. thanks. Aditya</p>",

Yes, theoretically you could have the same service listed twice, but only in special circumstances - for example is code 12331 was for 1 unit of service and 12332 was for 5 units of service then if a patient received 7 units of service you may have to bill for 1 x 12332 and 2 x 12331. Otherwise generally a service to the same body pat will only occur once or you will need to provide an override code - patient breaks arm and has a cast applied, walks out of hospital and falls down breaking cast, re-enters hospital and has a cast applied.</p>",
