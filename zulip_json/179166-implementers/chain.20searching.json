Servers SHOULD reject a search where the logical id refers to more than one matching resource across different types. For example, the client has to specify the type explicitly using the syntax in the second example above.\"<br>\nWhere is says \"Servers SHOULD reject a search where the logical id refers to more than one matching resource...\" Does reject mean to return a HTTP error code and possibly an OperationOutcome, or does reject mean to ignore the chained search parameter but process any other valid parameters?</p>",
