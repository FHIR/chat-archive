For R4, there is a <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-mimetypes.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-mimetypes.html\">MIME-Type ValueSet</a> that gives the coding system as <code>urn:ietf:bcp:13</code>. However, for STU3, the binding I have seen just refers to the set of all MIME-types by giving the URL to the RFC (<a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp13.txt\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp13.txt\">https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp13.txt</a>) and does not specify a coding system. What is the correct way of defining a ValueSet sub-set in this case? -If I read the spec right, there is no way to sub-set a ValueSet by listing specific codes without giving a system, but  <code>urn:ietf:bcp:13</code> only seems to turn up in connection with R4.</p>",
