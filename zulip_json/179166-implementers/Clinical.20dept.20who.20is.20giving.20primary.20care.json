Here in Oman government hospitals, clinical care providers are grouped under units/dept concept. Patients are never directed to a specific consultant instead, he is under the care of a group . Any of the consultant within the group will take care of the patient. So \"hospitalization\" mandatory specify the dept who is taking care of the patient primarily. Secondly, the history of records should be available to record the handovers between dept to dept.</p>",
