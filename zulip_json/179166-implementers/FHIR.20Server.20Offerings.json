The confluence pages that allow someone to add their products might be okay. The problem that standards organizations have gotten trouble in the past is when the SDO organizes a publication that lists products. This is an endorsement by the SDO of a product.   This is a lesson so strongly learned by DICOM, that they verbally start every meeting with a warning to not speak of products (pricing or customers).</p>",
