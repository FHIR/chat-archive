The mapping specifies that HealthcareService.serviceType.type from R2 is converted to HealthcareService.type in R3, however at a closer look at the FHIR Release 3 and the associated value sets,  the HealthcareService.specialty from R3 is the equivalent of  HealthcareService.serviceType.type from R2, and HealthcareService.type in R3 has a different meaning.  Is this true, or is it just an error on the webpage?</p>",
