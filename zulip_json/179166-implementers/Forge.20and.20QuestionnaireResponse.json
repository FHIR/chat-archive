It seems the Forge tool does not like this - it creates a new element, but not sub-elements (linkid, text, title etc). Am I approaching this incorrectly? If I edit the XML (adding a nested group element) by hand and load it into Forge, it sees the group as a slice and displays it with all the elements. </p>\n<p>Has anyone achieved something similar - if so, can they steer me in the right direction:</p>\n<p>To demonstrate:<br>\n...<br>\nQuestionnaireResponse </p>\n<p>root</p>\n<p>- group element - sliced</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre>       -  Section 1 (sub-group)  - slice\n             - question 1.1\n             - answer 1.1\n\n       - Section 2 (sub-group)  - slice\n             - question 2.1\n             - answer 2.1\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>...<br>\netc</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nDuncan</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi Duncan, thank you for reporting this issue! I think I can reproduce it in the current Forge 14.4.1 release. If I slice QuestionnaireResponse.group.question and add a slice, then Forge does not generate child elements (linkId, text, answer) for the slice. Same issue if I try to slice QuestionnaireResponse.group.question.answer. However slicing the identifier element works correctly. I'll investigate the issue.</p>",
