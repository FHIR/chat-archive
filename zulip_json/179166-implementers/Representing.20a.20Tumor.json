Another challenge is that tumors can  split, two tumors can merge, and a tumor can spread to new parts of the body.

There is standardisation work going on internationally (ICCR) which involves many colleges of pathology and UNMC. For the cutting edge, I direct you to the SNOMED CT international confluence pages: <a href=\"https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/iPaLM/Cancer+Synoptic+Subgroup\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/iPaLM/Cancer+Synoptic+Subgroup\">https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/iPaLM/Cancer+Synoptic+Subgroup</a> . You will need to create an account there if you don't already have one. Essentially the team at UNMC are encoding the CAP cancer worksheets (synoptic reports) with fully modeled SNOMED CT concepts and then submitting them to both SNOMED international and LOINC. So the codes will be LOINC and there will be Observable expressions in a reference set map which will be published jointly by SNOMED International and Regenstreif.</p>",

I'm going to keep the cancer type in the condition, have condition reference multiple body sites (including in the case of mets), with the body site code and qualifiers only representing the location.

M category shows that it has metastasized, and it might reference two unconnected BodySites, but in this situation I can't tell which was primary and which was secondary, particularly where it metastasized to the other breast or other lung (maybe something with timestamps but thats not obvious). Should mets be a second Condition? </p>\n<p>Were you guys thinking 'kind' would be 'required' bound to a simple value set like [anatomicalStructure, morphologicalAbnormality], or an extensible CodeableConcept that an implementer could bind to a concept like 'metastasis from malignant tumor of lung'?</p>",
