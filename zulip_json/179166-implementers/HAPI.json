Could you elaborate on what you mean by a context, or point me to the docs?<br>\nI've been thinking of appending the query parameter to limit the result to only a few, but if there's 100 patients, then the HTML query will probably be too large. So I've thought of post-processing the result, but it might get too expensive on the DB in case I'm filtering out after the original query has been executed. So SQL filtering has to be best approach. I guess the best approach for me, from all the help I've received so far would be to just add it in the API, correct? <br>\nI've had trouble figuring out the implementation. Are there examples similar to what I seek? And where, in which part of the code do I implement there? The codebase of HAPI, where would I add in this implementation?</p>",
