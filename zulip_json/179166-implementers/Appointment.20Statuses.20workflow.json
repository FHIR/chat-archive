Can the admin(Role:Admin) move an Appointment directly from 'Booked' to 'Fulfilled' state bypassing the 'Arrived' state?<br>\n2. If any of the Participant mistakenly marks an appointment to 'NoShow',  Can he/she change the status of Appointment back to Fulfilled?<br>\n3. Can an admin/patient cancel a booked appointment?</p>",
