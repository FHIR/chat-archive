For PDE, it's pretty easy and straightforward, after doing more digging into the actual data and your answer matches up for that (Part-D Event).  For Carrier Claims, it gets more difficult.  A carrier claim will have multiple claim lines that end up composing the entire eob structure.  Currently I do have all the different providers being listed in the eob.careTeam correctly.  However, the eob.provider is required in R4 and it's hard to determine which of the providers to use for this field as there 'may' be different providers per line item that are associated with the single eob.  Does that make sense?  Thoughts?</p>",
