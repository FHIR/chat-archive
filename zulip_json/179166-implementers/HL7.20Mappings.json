Are there plans to include HL7 mappings for RGS-3 and GT1 segments? We currently use the RGS-3 field to determine department info for an appointment. The FHIR model suggests that possibly a mapping to the Appointment.participant.actor of reference Type Location is appropriate but on the HL7  mappings page, actor is mapped to AIL, PID, AIG and AIP segments. In addition we use GT1 segment fields to determine guarantor information for a patient. The FHIR model suggests the Patient.contact with a PatientContactRelationship of guarantor is appropriate but the HL7 mappings page maps Patient.contacts to NK1 segment fields.</p>",
