In the absence of that I probably wouldn't expect this to work (and even if it was defined, the tooling might not be supporting it).  There was originally a notion that where an implicit \"all codes\" value set hadn't been defined the code system url could be used, as you are trying to do, but I think we're expecting to get away from that and apparently it isn't supported in the tooling.  So yes, as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191451\">@Patrick Werner</span> said, probably you will need to use (and define yourself, if you still can't find one) an explicit SNOMED CT \"all codes\" value set.</p>",
