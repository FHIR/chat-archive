Chiefly to match test scripts and FHIR Specification.  However, the Test Platform also has a role to validate the capability statement, what if the fhirVersion published is found to be invalid (e.g. FHIR VERSION: 1.5.0) according to FHIR Specifications - any Testing Platform would need to be able to validate/verify the FHIR Server version/Implementation conformance or interoperability and report accordingly - do folks agree?<br>\nRecommendation/Suggestion: FHIR Server Capability Statement must be an active part of any testing such that they are validated prior to any test platform undertaking test execution - this to ensure the information available to a FHIR Client would not result in non-interoperable exchange of information.</p>",

        "content": "<p>A message to the FHIR Implementers who on occasion \"test\" their FHIR implementation(s) - at the most recent HL7 WGM in San Antonio, TX and during the FHIR side chat Monday evening we discussed to what LEVEL validation and testing should be done with respect to FHIR published Value-Sets.  Our team works' to support the FHIR Test Platform Touchstone Project, and is creating \"real world\" integrated ecosystem(s) which exposes implementers to near \"real world\" scenarios to test against.  We work hard to support both client-side, server-side, and peer-to-peer testing. One of the questions/concerns which was raised during the FHIR-side Chat was to what degree should \"value-set\" values be tested, e.g. also \"value-set\" display value(s).  Example: system value=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/identifier-type\"/  with a value of \"FILL\" - would have a display value \"Filler Identifier\".   As discussed it is indeed valid for a FHIR Client/Server to reject messages in which the display value does not conform to the published value set.  I want to confirm my accurate reporting of our discussion here - the group did concur (consensus) that this was a valid/correct  action by the validator(s) and test platforms.</p>",
