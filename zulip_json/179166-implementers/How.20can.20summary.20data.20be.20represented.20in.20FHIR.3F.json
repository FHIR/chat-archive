We also need to capture a summary/total of the Insulin administered per day. We are unable to capture this in MedicationAdministration again because it will lead to data duplication. Is there any way to handle this in the MedicationAdministration resource? Or can we use a different resource like MedicationStatement to capture the summary? Since this data is coming from a device I am not sure MedicationStatement is ideal. Any inputs are highly appreciated. <br>\nThanks!</p>",

You wouldn't have a duplication issue because the partOf relationships would differentiate the 'detail' records from the 'summary' record</li>\n<li>you could use MedicationStatement as your summary and would need to use an extension to indicate the source as a Device (feel free to submit a change request to add Device as an allowed informationSource in future versions).  That's probably more granular than what most systems would expect MedicationStatement to be used for, but it could work.</li>\n</ul>",
