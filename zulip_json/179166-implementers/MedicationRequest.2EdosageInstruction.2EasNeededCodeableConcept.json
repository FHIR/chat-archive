Our current solution is to model this as a single MedicationRequest resource with multiple dosageInstruction repetitions (each with an asNeededCodeableConcept representing one of the PRN reasons) due to the 0..1 cardinality constraint on Dosage.asNeededCodeableConcept, but we're worried that may cause some confusion about the total number of prescribed doses. Do you have any recommendations/suggestions on how to represent such a MedRequest?<br>\nThanks!</p>",
