        "content": "<p>Hi,<br>\nI'm using  IG Publisher v1.1.2 to create an IG which has a dependency on a package published on Simplifier. To do so, I include the following snippet in my ImplementationGuide resource:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code> <span class=\"nt\">&lt;dependsOn&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;uri</span> <span class=\"na\">value=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;http://nictiz.nl/fhir/zib2017/prerelease&quot;</span><span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;packageId</span> <span class=\"na\">value=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;nictiz.fhir.nl.stu3.zib2017-prerelease&quot;</span><span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;version</span> <span class=\"na\">value=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;2.0.0-beta3&quot;</span><span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/dependsOn&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>(the uri is made up).</p>\n<p>The resulting qa.html contains a lot of errors about the generated HTML pages for profiles (so about the FHIR profiles themselves), in the form of \"unable to parse character reference ...\". Upon inspection, this seems to be caused by generated Simplifier links like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">li</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">a</span> <span class=\"na\">href</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;https://simplifier.net/resolve?scope=nictiz.fhir.nl.stu3.zib2017-prerelease@2.0.0-beta3&amp;canonical=http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-patient&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-patient<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">a</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">li</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The ampersand is not properly escaped here. This is about the link that is on the \"Text Summary\"</p>",
