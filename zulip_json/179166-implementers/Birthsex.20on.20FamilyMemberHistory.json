        "content": "<p>I'm concerned about the renaming of \"gender\" to \"birthSex\" on FamilyMemberHistory.  I'm worried that it doesn't reflect what systems actually prompt for and what patient's necessarily report.  I recognize that what's <em>desired</em> is typically the genetic gender of the family member in order to trace inheritance-related risks that are y-chromosome or x-chromosome-specific.  However, if the patient will not always know the birthSex of a relative and if the data that existing systems have captured doesn't already reflect the birthSex of the relative, then the FHIR standard should align with existing practice - i.e. that the gender reflects reported gender which may or may not correlate with chromosomal gender.  My preference would be to keep the name of the element as \"gender\" but to note a preference for capturing chromosomal gender; to note that \"full\" chromosomal gender (e.g. XYY) should be captured as an observation; that relationship type and gender won't necessarily correlate (\"Aunt Sue\" might be captured as male) and that reported gender and actual chromosomal gender may differ.</p>\n<p>However, I'm curious whether my beliefs about what current EMRs actually do is accurate.  Do existing EHRs prompt specifically for birthSex and only capture the gender if the birthSex is known?</p>",

From what I've seen in the market, it's only the newest or largest of systems that are built with genomics in mind or give consideration to birthSex/gender.  There's a huge long-tail of ancilary systems that are still on the M/F/O/U model.  Not to mention that the birthSex value has a bunch of political baggage and agenda associated with it; and isn't entirely reflective of the underlying biology (i.e. AIS as an example). </p>\n<p>Instead of renaming, would a \"OneOf\" option be possible?</p>",
