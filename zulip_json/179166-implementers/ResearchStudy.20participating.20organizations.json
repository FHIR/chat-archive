I see at the moment to possible ways to model this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>- Creating an additional location resource for each already existing organization resource and referencing the organization in the location and the location in the research study.\n- Creating an extension for participating organizations in the research study resource.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>What would be the preferred way to go? Or is there another way to model this?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for the responses and best regards.</p>",

Participating location seems like it should be an Organization as it's about responsibility, not about physical walls.  If a clinic was participating and they moved across the street, they'd still be the same \"participating location\" - they'd just have a new address.  I.e. the Organization would be the same even though the Location would be a distinct instance.</p>",
