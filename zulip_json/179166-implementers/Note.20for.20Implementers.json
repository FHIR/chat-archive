Content from IHE and DICOM is moving out of the build and will be replaced with references to their web sites. But the build still needs the content internally, so it will still have copies of the resources. In order to assist implementers, all the resources that are handled this way will be placed in a file external-resources.xml/json, in case you want access to them when generating code or initialising terminology servers. Note that this file will not be accessible from the web pages, but will be in examples.zip etc</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191367\">@Brian Postlethwaite</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191328\">@Ewout Kramer</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191319\">@James Agnew</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191339\">@Pascal Pfiffner</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"195036\">@Carol Macumber</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191611\">@John Leitch</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191364\">@Peter Jordan</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191343\">@Michael Lawley</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191375\">@Alexander Henket</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191404\">@John Moehrke</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191380\">@Elliot Silver</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191982\">@Ted Klein</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191405\">@Rob Hausam</span></p>",
