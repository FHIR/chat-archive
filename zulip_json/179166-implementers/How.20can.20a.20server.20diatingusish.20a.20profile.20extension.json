Its resourceType follows the base type is extends (e.g. DiagnosticReport in this example)</p>\n<p>And <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2016Sep/search.html#profile\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2016Sep/search.html#profile\">http://hl7.org/fhir/2016Sep/search.html#profile</a> Indicates that a serach parameter is supported to locate this profile :<br>\n'''<br>\nGET [base]/DiagnosticReport?_profile=http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/lipid<br>\nGET [base]/DiagnosticReport?_profile=Profile/lipid<br>\n'''<br>\nSo the server is capable of selecting this kind of profile. Can anyone explain how to achieve this target? Will it depend on a primate key as an identity? or will it depend on the check of the structure definition followed by fhir specification? thx</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192319\">@yiwang</span> Can you explain a bit more what you're trying to do?  _profile allows you to filter to only include resources that declare a specified profile.  Profiles and extensions are not the same thing.  Profiles are a collection of constraints that a particular instance might be compliant with.  Extensions are additional elements that might be present in an instance (and which could be mandated to be present or otherwise constrained by a profile).  The specific example you pointed to doesn't declare a profile in the instance, so you won't be able to find it by searching by profile - even though in this case it should be conformant with the lipids profile.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  I'm sorry for using the word 'profile extension'. Actually I only concern about profile. I just wonder how the search param works and how can we distinguish a specified profile (e.g. lipids profile) from the original(or the base type) (e.g. DiagnosticReport) They are both with key referenceType='DiagnosticReportâ€˜ and I did not find any tagged symbol/token to indicate it is profiled as lipid profile ones. : (</p>",
