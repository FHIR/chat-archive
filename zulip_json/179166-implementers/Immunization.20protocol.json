For one, being able to specify an Age-based timing would have uses everywhere Timing is used. And more importantly, the useContext is intended to be used to specify an appropriate Age range for potential usage of the ActivityDefinition, where the timing element in the ActivityDefinition itself is used to specify the template value when generating the actual activity resource for a specific subject. For example, the useContext might specify \"This ActivityDefinition is appropriate for ages 50-54\", but the timingAge would specify the value for the timingAge element of generated Activity, usually as an expression.</p>",
