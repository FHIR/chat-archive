There is no search parameter for the 'diagnosisreference ' field in the resource. I am trying the revinclude option to fetch me the Condition resources referenced in ExplanationOfBenefit resource. The query is as follows:<br>\npd-fhir-viewer:8080/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir/Condition?_revinclude=ExplanationOfBenefit:Patient/PGXC12  When am executing this it returns all the condition resources in the server, rather than returning the specific Condition resource as referenced in the ExplanationOfBenefit resource. I am using the HAP FHIR and am going to post there as well but just wanted to check if the approach is right or if there is a better way of doing this. Thanks.</p>",
