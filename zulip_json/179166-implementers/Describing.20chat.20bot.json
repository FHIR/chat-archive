I'm looking to describe a chat bot as participant of patient's encounter. I feel it should be part of <code>Individuals</code> in Administration module, however I'm not sure if it is the correct to way to approach it, or should it be rather a modifying extension for practitioner resource type(as the bot is capable of carrying out triage). I would appreciate if someone could point me in the right direction. Thanks!</p>",
