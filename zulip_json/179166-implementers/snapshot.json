Then, on the left, is the expansion from the Java tool, on the right the expansion by the .NET generator. As you can see, the Java tool has copied the definitional stuff from SimpleQuantity over into the referenceRange.high, but I don't think it should, since this overrides the more specific definitions from Observation.referenceRange.high, and you are not really moving into the SimpleQuantity type, just fixing the value.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/bZcGpu9UHE1cYjK46PdSxOZ7/pasted-image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"/user_uploads/10155/bZcGpu9UHE1cYjK46PdSxOZ7/pasted-image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/bZcGpu9UHE1cYjK46PdSxOZ7/pasted-image.png\"></a></div>",
