I see the column that says SNOMED yes/no; do you have a version of this spreadsheet that lists the SNOMED codes you found ?   Also, do you have a mapping of the equivalent HL7 V2.x Repeat Patterns (table 0335) for these?  It would be very helpful in mapping HL7 Med messages to FHIR.</p>",

I'm not sure that UK SNOMED CT definitions are the same as international ones so each individual country should check their own definitions.
