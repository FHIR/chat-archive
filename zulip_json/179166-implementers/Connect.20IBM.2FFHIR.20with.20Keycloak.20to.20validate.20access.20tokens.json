I just enabled <code>oauth</code> in <code>fhir-server-config.json</code> file and set the auth server endpoints but i am not sure which files should i modify to connect the keycloak server from the IBM/FHIR project. Is there any documentation, blog post etc. about it or can somebody guide me about the issue? Thanks for your support!</p>",
