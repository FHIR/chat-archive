When the target of a canonical reference is a contained resource, the canonical reference will have a fragment as part of the URL:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>... but can a <code>Reference.reference</code> also play this trick? For example, can I have a <code>DiagnosticReport.subject</code> like <code>{\"reference\": \"Observation/123#pat\"}</code> (a hypothetical contained Patient inside an Observation)? </p>\n<p>I see the following on <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/references.html#contained\">http://hl7.org/fhir/references.html#contained</a> that this <code>#pat</code> reference would seem to violate:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>References to contained resources are never resolved outside the container resource</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>... but then again, the <code>#vs1</code> example <em>also</em> seems to violate this rule, so I'm not sure I'm interpreting the prohibition on \"never resolved outside the container\" correctly :-)</p>",
