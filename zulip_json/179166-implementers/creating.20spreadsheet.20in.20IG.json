Your profiles might well include some which will include components to convey additional nuances/qualifiers of the main observation that wouldn't make sense on their own.  Once you've got your profile boundaries figured out, you can figure out how you need to organize those profiles in your IG.  If you use one of the frameworks used by one of the existing HL7 IGs, you'll end up with a few pages for each profile and will then link/organize them with the ad-hoc pages that provide the navigation for your IG.  If that's not going to work for you, you'll have to get more into the guts of how the IGPublisher works and define your own framework.  That's going to mean getting familiar with how Jekyll works, how the existing frameworks work, what different fragments the IGPublisher can produce, modeling out what you want  the eventual HTML to look like and then putting it all together.  (And that whole process isn't really one we can walk you through here - it'll probably take you anywhere from one to several weeks of messing around if you want to build your own framework.)</p>",
