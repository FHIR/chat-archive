Our current plan is to have one of our C-CDA implementers produce a document, run the transformation on it, and then have a FHIR system consume the resulting Composition Bundle and see how it fares.</p>\n<p>This is a shout-out to the FHIR implementer community to see if there are implementations out there who can potentially consume FHIR Documents and would be willing to be a test system for us during the Implementation-A-Thon.  The Implementation-A-Thon will be in the DC area at the Kaiser Permanente Center for Total Health but if you are unable to attend, we can accommodate you attending remotely for the period where we discuss this.</p>\n<p>Please let us know by contacting Dave Hamill at <a href=\"mailto:dhamill@hl7.org\" title=\"mailto:dhamill@hl7.org\">dhamill@hl7.org</a>.  More details about the Implementation-A-Thon can be found on the HL7 website: <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/events/c-cda/implementation/2018/08/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hl7.org/events/c-cda/implementation/2018/08/\">http://www.hl7.org/events/c-cda/implementation/2018/08/</a></p>",
