Many resources allow that to be a choice of CodeableConcept or Reference(Condition), but I think OO decided that wasn't terribly common in the diagnostics space.  SupportingInformation is intended to convey information that's needed in order to perform the observation.  E.g. patient weight, pregnancy status, liver function or other things the lab or observation peformer needs to know in order to perform the test</p>",
