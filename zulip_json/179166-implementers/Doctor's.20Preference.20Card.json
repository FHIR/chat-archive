Specifically, the DPC will have at least a provider and a procedure in the header, and a list of items (such as equipment, supply, etc.) . See an example here (<a href=\"https://app.prefcards.com/r/b745fda2-c957-49be-bc7a-fe41bada759c\">https://app.prefcards.com/r/b745fda2-c957-49be-bc7a-fe41bada759c</a>)</p>\n<p>FHIR doesn't have a native resource for that, so we are considering the following options:</p>\n<p>1, Using a FHIR List resource</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Using a FHIR Group resource</li>\n<li>Build a custom resource based on the FHIR basic resource.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm wondering if anyone in the community has gone through this and have some advices? Really appreciate it!</p>",
