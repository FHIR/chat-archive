Or should we use other resources like ClinicalImpression?</p>\n<p>And about the terminology;<br>\nIn ICD-10, there is a code like Z00.0 General medical examination or Z02.4 Examination for driving license, but I can't find codes for the same purpose on SNOMED CT. Or just a code that say the patient is healthy. Are there SNOMED CT codes for these situations?</p>",

The condition resource may be used to record a condition following a procedure, such as the condition of Amputee-BKA following an amputation procedure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though the Condition documentation doesn't address the \"healthy\" or \"well\" states explicitly, they are included by implication in the statement above.
