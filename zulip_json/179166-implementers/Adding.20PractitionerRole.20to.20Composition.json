This is where these two Resources 'look' very similar, although their similarity is only at this metadata level. Any delta in this metadata level is likely not proper, and when it is it should be strongly justified. Yes, IHE has submitted a CP to add PractionerRole to DocumentReference author. I initially put it in as <a href=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13266\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13266\">GF#13266</a>, but simply adding PractitionerRole may be the solution.

The only information that's not super-relevant is the period and status information, but frankly that wasn't terribly relevant when we referenced Practitioner either.</p>",
