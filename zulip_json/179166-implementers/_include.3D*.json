The other FHIR guidance on the meaning of _include (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#revinclude\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#revinclude</a>) aside, this is not explicitly linked to the CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.searchParam elements.</p>\n<p>The CARIN group was thinking about explicitly requiring those searchInclude values, explain that the _include=* meant the minimum of those specified (though a server could add more). The means for which to implement that would be left up to the server (one option being they could add those references as search parameters).</p>\n<p>Any concerns about this approach?</p>",
