The clinical context is of an outpatient appointment containing both history and new observations in support of a diabetes consultation. The source XML is presently aorund 3500 lines.</p>\n<p>The first thing is that this document or consultation can happen over a short period of time and by mulitple authors. Depending on where you draw the line of the \"composition\" it could either be a bundle of documents, each of which has the context of the date, location, coded clinical context plus a series of observations, or alternativly one large all encompassing structure. </p>\n<p>The important point is that the blob is designed to self contained with not external references. We do not have yet have a fully operation FHIR server (and are building to that), but in the short term can we develop standardised approach to our documents that paves the way for meaningful reuse in the future. And that's where the use of the com[position resource bothers me as it (as i understand it) is not supposed to be self contained snapshot. I think I am describing the output of a compostion resource operation. </p>\n<p>Thoughts welcomed...</p>",

The first resource within that Bundle has to be a Composition that lists all other resources contained in there.

You still can have a Composition resource that keeps them together. And you can even generate a Bundle on the fly from that Composition using the $document operation.
