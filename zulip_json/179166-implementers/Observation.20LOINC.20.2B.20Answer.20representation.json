I've been looking around for examples for what I'm trying to do, but I haven't had much luck there so hoping maybe someone here can point me in the right direction?</p>\n<p>I am trying to craft an Observation resource with code=http://loinc.org|9855-8 (<a href=\"https://loinc.org/9855-8/\">https://loinc.org/9855-8/</a>).  This code has an associated Answer List (<a href=\"https://loinc.org/LL740-2/\">https://loinc.org/LL740-2/</a>), one of which is \"Other, Specify:\" (LA46-8).  I want the resultant Observation to indicate this answer, and specify some text associated with it.</p>\n<p>Does that make sense?</p>\n<p>What would such an Observation look like?  Would it just be a matter of adding a component to this Observation with code=http://loinc.org|LA46-8 and valueString=\"whatever\"?  Is it that simple?</p>\n<p>Thanks for any assistance and please let me know if anything didn't make sense.</p>\n<p>Matt</p>",
