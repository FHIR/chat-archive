        "content": "<p><a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/search.html#revinclude\">http://build.fhir.org/search.html#revinclude</a> states: (qoute) Both _include and _revinclude use the wild card \"*\" for the search parameter name, indicating that any search parameter of type=reference be included. Though both clients and servers need to take care not to request or return too many resources when doing this. Most notably, using iterative wildcards inclusions might lead to the retrieval of the full patient's record, or even more than that: resources are organized into an interlinked network and broad _include paths may eventually traverse all possible paths on the server. For servers, these iterative and wildcard _includes are demanding and may slow the search response time significantly.  (end qoute)</p>\n<p>On the assumption that \"<em>\" was meant as a literal string - how does one use this in a search? None of the servers that I tested with seem to be aware of such a syntax, e.g. GET /Patient?identifier=123&amp;_include=Patient:</em> - what's the intent of the above documentation, or how is this supposed to work?</p>\n<p>If the literal \"*\" appears only in the parameter <em>definition</em> then the above wording needs an update, for that's not what it currently states.</p>",
