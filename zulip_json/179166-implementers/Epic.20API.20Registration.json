I'm not an attorney, but requiring ONC Certification would make providers whose APIs depend on Epic for registration non-compliant because the criteria I listed at the beginning have nothing to do with the API's security or technical specifications.</p>\n<p>Another thing that comes to mind is HIPAA's Privacy Rule, which requires a covered entity to provide the individual with access to its PHI in the form and format requested, if readily producible in that form and format. In this case, providers already have a perfectly functioning API capable of transmitting PHI, but Epic's ONC certification requirement could be seen as limiting the individual's right of access to it, which is illegal.</p>\n<p>I would like to know what the FHIR community thinks about this, especially those of you who are developing consumer apps in the U.S. and are non-covered entities as defined by HIPAA.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I've always found this language puzzling, because it seems to assume that <em>client</em> applications would for some reason be exposing data <em>as servers</em> (i.e., Epic seems to be imposing on client apps the same obligations that ONC imposes on certified EHRs, which I find puzzling). I've personally clicked through the agreement in the past because it was the only way for me to get <a href=\"https://github.com/jmandel/my-health-data\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jmandel/my-health-data\">my own FHIR data</a> from MyChart.</p>",

The client record doesn't need to be approved, isn't reviewed by anyone from Epic (or anywhere else), and is automatically deployed to Epic's customers within hours of its creation.</li>\n<li>Epic's primary motivation for collecting information and attestations when a developer creates a client record is to do our best to protect patients' privacy while complying with regulations.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, I will not be able to debate the specifics of the language on open.epic, I'm just sharing the intent behind it.</p>",
