If not we will likely reject the proposal. </p>\n<p>For each resource returned from a read, vread, search, or other operation; each valid instance level operation on that resource is returned as a link associated with the resource. The relation of the link identifies the operation, the URL is the URL to follow to perform that operation.</p>\n<p>For type level operations such as create, the same approach is followed with the create operation being returned associated with the search bundle. The conceptual model behind this is that create is an operation performed on the list.</p>\n<p>Example: A read of an observation that the user is able to update.<br>\nGET /fhir-dstu2/obsevation/5<br>\nWould return a HTTP Link header such as:<br>\nLink: &lt;/fhir-dstu2/obsevation/5&gt;; rel=\"update\", &lt;/fhir-dstu2/obsevation/5&gt;; rel=\"read\"</p>",

Thus there is a method of communicating actor/context specific security labels, use the Bundle meta.security. This said, the overall proposal is more broad and useful...</p>\n<p>First, the Link: header would only be returned to trusted clients able to utalize this. Thus where there is minimal trust the header can be not provided. The Link header is just advice, it is not a guarantee that the client will be able to do an 'update'. As long as these are clear, it should be okay to provide this method of improving the client side processing.</p>",

It clearly would be a policy choice on the server to calculate and offer the link header. I would expect that some systems will find it trivial to add the link header, especially when it is just a reflection of the OAuth scope (which is my worry that it is just another path for the same data)... Thus I think I am agreeing with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191912\">@Michele Mottini</span> that the most useful implementation would be expensive. That is where the response recognizes not just OAuth scope but also other business rules such as, but not limited to, consent status.</p>",
