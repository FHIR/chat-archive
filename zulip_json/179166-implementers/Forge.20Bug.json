Please hold on, as publication of the next Forge release is scheduled for this week. Also, note that there is a specialized Zulip stream called \"conformance\" that is more suitable for discussing profiling and tooling issues. Cheers!</p>",

When I reload the profile, the valueQuantity returns to a value[x] and all my work is moved into a component element. It's driving me nuts. I re-create the valueQuantity, copy the stuff I had entered from the component element fields back into the fields where they belong, only to lose them again on some future re-load. If I save directly and re-load, the error does not happen. I do not know what it is I need to do to cause the error yet.</p>",
