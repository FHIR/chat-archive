After some searching I was thinking to create a HAPI Fiir JPA Server   (<a href=\"https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/docs/server_jpa/introduction.html\">https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/docs/server_jpa/introduction.html</a>) to process the message and save them to a database. Unfortunately the hospital still uses hl7 2.4, but I guess this shouldn't be so hard to create a mapping hl7 2.4 -&gt; hl7 fhir. As said it will only be a demo so I won't have to cover every single event there is but should give the hospital an idead of what it could be like to use a cdr. <br>\nSo I thought I'll ask if you guys if you agree on doing this way or maybe see better solutions.</p>",
