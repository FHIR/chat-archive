It would. be included under medicationRequest.dispenseRequest - which is the element that provides information to the dispenser.   This kind of information would need to be included on each medicationRequest that it applies to.   You could add an extension for now, but I would suggest that you add a change request for the Pharmacy Work Group to consider.  Please make sure you explain your specific use case in the change request.</p>",
