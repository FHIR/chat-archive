However, from my experience, V2 is far too wild to ever come up with a \"one-size-fits-all\" mapping. I guess it'll always be a case by case thing depending on the V2 source system and the use case requirements. So your best bet is to pick an integration engine with a neat UI and push through the tedious work of mapping field by field. If you're lucky, you'll be able to reuse most of what you've done and just need some tiny changes, every time you redeploy with a different source system/different FHIR server/different use case</p>",
