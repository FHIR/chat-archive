        "content": "<p>Hey all! This chat was linked to from the <a href=\"http://hl7.org\">hl7.org</a> site. Can I ask general HL7 questions here? If not, where can I?</p>\n<p>Specifically I am looking for HL7 v2 messaging schemas. I found these XML schema downloads on <a href=\"http://hl7.org\">hl7.org</a>: <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=213\">https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=213</a> ... however, I think there may be a bug in the 2.7.1, 2.8 and 2.8.2 downloads. In 2.5.1, in datatypes.xsd, the CX.9 field has a type of \"CWE\":</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"XML\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;xsd:attributeGroup</span> <span class=\"na\">name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"CX.9.ATTRIBUTES\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;xsd:attribute</span> <span class=\"na\">name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"Type\"</span> <span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"xsd:string\"</span> <span class=\"na\">fixed=</span><span class=\"s\">\"CWE\"</span><span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;xsd:attribute</span> <span class=\"na\">name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"LongName\"</span> <span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"xsd:string\"</span> <span class=\"na\">fixed=</span><span class=\"s\">\"Assigning Jurisdiction\"</span><span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/xsd:attributeGroup&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I believe this is correct. I am cross-referencing it with this site: <a href=\"https://v2plus.hl7.org/2021Jan/data-type/CX.html\">https://v2plus.hl7.org/2021Jan/data-type/CX.html</a></p>\n<p>However, in the 2.7.1, 2.8 and 2.8.2 downloads, CX.9 has a type of \"CX\":</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"XML\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;xsd:attributeGroup</span> <span class=\"na\">name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"CX.9.ATTRIBUTES\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;xsd:attribute</span> <span class=\"na\">name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"Type\"</span> <span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"xsd:string\"</span> <span class=\"na\">fixed=</span><span class=\"s\">\"CX\"</span><span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;xsd:attribute</span> <span class=\"na\">name=</span><span class=\"s\">\"LongName\"</span> <span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">\"xsd:string\"</span> <span class=\"na\">fixed=</span><span class=\"s\">\"Assigning Jurisdiction\"</span><span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/xsd:attributeGroup&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This appears incorrect to me. I don't think a recursive field makes sense.</p>\n<p>So I am wondering where I can report issues about HL7 org downloads? Is there a public JIRA or something like that? And then where can I get correct/complete schemas for HL7 v2 messages?</p>\n<p>It looks like the HAPI library has correct version 28 schemas: <a href=\"https://hapifhir.github.io/hapi-hl7v2/v28/apidocs/ca/uhn/hl7v2/model/v28/datatype/CX.html\">https://hapifhir.github.io/hapi-hl7v2/v28/apidocs/ca/uhn/hl7v2/model/v28/datatype/CX.html</a> </p>\n<p>And this website is generating HTML version of the schemas: <a href=\"https://v2plus.hl7.org/2021Jan/data-type/CX.html\">https://v2plus.hl7.org/2021Jan/data-type/CX.html</a></p>\n<p>So where is HAPI and <a href=\"http://hl7.org\">hl7.org</a> getting their information from? Is there an official/canonical source for HL7 v2 schema (in a machine readable format e.g. XML or DB export)?</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for any help!</p>",
