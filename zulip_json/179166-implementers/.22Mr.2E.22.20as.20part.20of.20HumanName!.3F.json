There can be different types of prefixes and suffixes that indicate a variety of things - gender, marital status, professional status, education, etc.  If you just have \"prefix\", there's no way to tell what the meaning is.  There are extensions that can let you differentiate though.

In Sweden they check whether the national person number is odd or even, which is an indication of gender and thus an indication of whether Mr or Ms should be used. Quite often for minors the use of Mr/Ms is omitted, and the full given name is used. All of this is supported by the FHIR datatype, how one uses it is up to the context.</p>",
