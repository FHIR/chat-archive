So I was assuming a a message bundle with a focus on a Communication resource containing a contentReference in the payload.  I was suggested to me that the focus should potentially be a DocumentReference instead, because that can encapsulate a reference to a document and references to related attachments which I needed.  </p>\n<p>The issue for me became that I needed a place to put the recipients that I would have put in Communication.recipient.   MessageHeader.destination.receiver seemed the obvious place, except for the cardinality of 0..1 and the fact that the documentation states that the possible receivers don't allow for CareTeam, which I would need.</p>",
