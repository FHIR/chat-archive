Our use case is this: there is an application in which you can find the nearest practitioner and make an appointment with him. However, we were faced with the following question: who should be an actor in the resource Schedule.actor? We think that it is necessary to create 2 actors: patient and practitioner.<br>\nThis option works well if the practitioner provides services at one point (Location). We often find that a practitioner provides services at several points (Locations) and then we cannot say for sure which Location his schedule belongs to. We thought of using a PractitionerRole to separate, but a practitioner with one role can also provide services in two Locations. This again does not provide a binding to a specific schedule at a particular point. We can enter constraints that the PractitionerRole referenced to exactly one Location. But maybe there are some other solution options and someone solved this problem?</p>",

Yes, you're right, but Location has hoursOfOperation, which determines its availability. We considered the option you proposed, but there is a use case when a practitioner has two different roles in one Location, for example, a gynecologist and an ultrasound practitioner.<br>\nEach role, in this case, should have its own schedule.</p>\n<p>A PractitionerRole may be suitable for this. However, according to information from DevDays, there is a risk that this resource may be combined with a Practitioner.</p>",
