        "content": "<p>I just attended FHIR Dev Days in Boston, what a great event! As I sit on the train back to NY today, a lot of information is swimming in my head and I'm trying to make sense of a few things. I wonder if someone could shed some light on the following. There are some questions in here, but also a few statements that summarize my understanding of key concepts. Comments on whether or not I'm on/off base would be appreciated <span class=\"emoji emoji-1f600\" title=\"grinning\">:grinning:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Implementation guides</strong> - I've heard a lot of talk about these. The Argonaut guide comes to mind, along with US Core. <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/index.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/index.html</a> Since a lot of work has gone into these guides, it doesn't feel right to start over. What would be the recommended approach to using, for example, the US Core implementation guide as a base, but customizing it to fit our use case in clinical research?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Profiles</strong> - these appear to be super important when coming up with agreed upon contracts with respect to data exchange. They also seem to go hand in hand with an implementation guide, which from what I have seen just summarizes profiles, extensions, search parameters, capability statement. Is this accurate?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Extensions</strong> - Used to define valid requirements not part of the core FHIR specification. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the above seems like where we need to start if we want to have meaningful dialogue around an exchange mechanism for clinical research use cases. Hopefully some FHIR experts can weigh in!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194077\">@Matthew Koch</span>.  Glad you had a good time at DevDays.</p>\n<p>1. There are two approaches to \"using\" U.S. Core or any other IG.  One is to derive your IG and profiles from those defined in the parent IG.  In that case, you inherit/have available what the other IG has defined and are bound by whatever constraints they've made.  If the parent IG says 1..1 or fixed value or fixed binding or \"must support\", you can't loosen that.  But you can add additional guidance, add further constraints, introduce additional extensions, etc.  The other possibility is to be \"aligned with\" or \"informed by\".  In that case, you create your own parallel IG/profiles and you do your best to follow the patterns and constraints in the base IG, but you might diverge from time to time because your context is different.  For example, if I was creating a Canadian equivalent of US Core, I'd try to stay pretty close - because we want solutions that work in the US to work in Canada with minimal modification, but we'd have to change a few things, such as the notion of race &amp; ethnicity (which are very US-centric), change bindings from RxNorm to the appropriate Canadian code system, etc.  That wouldn't be a derived IG, but it would (hopefully) be an 'aligned' IG.  Note that 'alignment' isn't a formal assertable/testable thing.  It's just an intention you can have and maybe document in text.</p>\n<p>2. Implementation guides collect a set of profiles, extensions, search parameters, capability statements, examples and other conformance resources together into a package that gives guidance to implementers on how to use FHIR to solve a particular problem/set of problems in a particular context.</p>\n<p>3. Extensions - yes.  Essentially extensions are used to keep all implementers from having to worry about edge cases that are important to only a limited subset of implementers.</p>",

The HL7 IGPublisher is free, but it can be pretty involved to set up.  You're best off to start from an existing IG and tweak than to start from scratch with just the documentation.</p>",
