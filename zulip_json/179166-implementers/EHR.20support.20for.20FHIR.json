        "content": "<p>Hi all,<br>\nI work for the Michigan Center for Effective IT Adoption (M-CEITA) and am doing some research into EHR readiness/compatibility with FHIR.  I am not sure if this is the correct place to get answers, but it was suggested I use this resource; please feel free to re-direct if needed.  As a Client Services Manager, I help clinicians and health systems pursue Meaningful Use/Interoperability, specifically in regards to the Medicaid incentive program.  I am compiling a resource for my clients to use regarding their EHRs ability to use FHIR to help meet Meaningful Use measures, and since my clients use a variety of EHR products, I'm trying to cast a wide net while I research.  If you work for, or know of a contact at, an EHR vendor and can help provide information, please message me.  I am interested in the following information:<br>\n1)  Is your CEHRT product FHIR compliant?<br>\n             a. If yes, are multiple products available? <br>\n                  i.Which ones are FHIR compliant?<br>\n             b.If no, are you in the process of becoming FHIR compliant?</p>\n<p>2)  Is anyone currently using FHIR to access your data?</p>\n<p>It may be best to have a conversation offline, but any assistance is much appreciated. Thank you for your time,      Lauren</p>",
