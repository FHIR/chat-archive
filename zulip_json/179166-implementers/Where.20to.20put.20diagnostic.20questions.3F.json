The main thing of a radiology order is the diagnostic question such as \" Are there signs for a tumor?\", \"Is the head of the femur broken?\" etc. reasonReference allows only for condition, observation and diagnostic report: What is the correct way of implementation? Thanky a lot for suggestions.</p>",
