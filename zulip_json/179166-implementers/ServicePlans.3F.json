We've been using FHIR tasking to enable vaccination campaigns, indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria control, etc.   In this context, borrowing form the CarePlan idea we came up with something called a Plan (considering renaming this to ServicePlan) that allows you to define activities and associated tasks for a practitioner to complete.  These tasks can be applied to patients or locations in our data model.</p>",

The focus here is more on the orchestration of service delivery by providers and not so much from a patient centric / CarePlan approach.   I hope this makes sense.  Any insights on this would be very helpful.  Thank you.</p>",
