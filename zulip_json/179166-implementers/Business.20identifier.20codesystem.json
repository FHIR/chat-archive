For example, if I wanted to add a health plan member ID as a patient identifier I am not sure what code system would be appropriate for this identifier. In my example the business identifier I am trying to use would not be globally unique but it would stay the same over time. Would I be able to use a code system that is not published, e.g. <a href=\"http://www.acme.org/patient\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.acme.org/patient\">www.acme.org/patient</a>? </p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
