        "content": "<p>Good Afternoon FHIR Folks!</p>\n<p>I am writing this post to hopefully get some clarification on the \"_include\" query parameter, and what to expect from the resultant Bundle returned from the server. For this, I am using the HAPI baseR4 test server  ( <a href=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/\">http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/</a> ).</p>\n<p>I am a bit confused working with it now, as it seems to return to me only the base resource called is returned in the bundle and no additional resources that were requested with the _include command. </p>\n<p>The baseR4 server seems to reflect that this is a possibility, per their capability statement (see image below):</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/cahbAWgfdCBwBGNQbA6trY5s/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pasted_image.png\">pasted image</a></p>\n<p>However, none of my calls seem to retrieve a Patient resource in the same bundle as the Condition resource called, despite the Condition resource in question clearly having a Patient reference as an element under \"subject\". </p>\n<p>The following queries were, for me, unsuccessful: <br>\n- <a href=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Condition/17926?_include=Condition:subject\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Condition/17926?_include=Condition:subject\">http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Condition/17926?_include=Condition:subject</a><br>\n- <a href=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Condition/17926?_include=Condition.subject\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Condition/17926?_include=Condition.subject\">http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Condition/17926?_include=Condition.subject</a> (I have seen folks using the single dot . syntax so I figured I would try it)<br>\n- <a href=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Condition/17926?_include=Condition:patient\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Condition/17926?_include=Condition:patient\">http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Condition/17926?_include=Condition:patient</a><br>\n- <a href=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Condition/17926?_include=Condition.patient\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Condition/17926?_include=Condition.patient\">http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Condition/17926?_include=Condition.patient</a><br>\n- <a href=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Condition/17926?_include=Patient\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Condition/17926?_include=Patient\">http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Condition/17926?_include=Patient</a></p>\n<p>For all the above endpoints, I am simply returned the single Condition resource (see image below - notice that there is indeed a Patient reference in the \"subject\" element\" ) <br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/edToStgG11R4RmPJj6yLed-_/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pasted_image.png\">pasted image</a></p>\n<p>I noticed that this gentleman had found a way to get the entire base resource as well as the \"included\" resource in his response bundle. This is what I am shooting for: <a href=\"https://github.com/FHIR/fhir.js/issues/121#issuecomment-419844202\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/FHIR/fhir.js/issues/121#issuecomment-419844202\">https://github.com/FHIR/fhir.js/issues/121#issuecomment-419844202</a></p>\n<p>I have a feeling there is a simple, small step that I am not utilizing, so I thought I would broach the subject with this community because you all have been so helpful and patient in the past. I look forward to any and all advice I can get on this! Cheers <br>\n- Mike</p>",
