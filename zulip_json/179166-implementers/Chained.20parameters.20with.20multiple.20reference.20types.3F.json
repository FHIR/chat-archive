Because the Diagnostic Report subject can be one of a set of different resources, it's necessary to limit the search to a particular type:<br>\n<code>\nGET [base]/DiagnosticReport?subject:Patient.name=peter\n</code><br>\nThis request returns all the lab reports that have a subject which is a patient, whose name includes \"peter\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does this mean that for <code>GET [base]/DiagnosticReport?subject.name=peter</code><br>\n1. the server should fail the search since it does not limit the search to a particular reference type.<br>\nor <br>\n2. the server should process the search: there are four valid reference types for DiagnosticReport.subject - Patient, Group, Device or Location, only Patient and Location have \"name\" as a valid search parameter, so the server returns all reports that have a subject which is a patient or location, whose name includes \"peter\".</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
