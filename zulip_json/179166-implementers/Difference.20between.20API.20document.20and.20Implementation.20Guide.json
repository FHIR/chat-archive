The Implementation guide seems to cover what our FHIR server will implement- but it will reference USCore and other IGs. I'd appreciate any clarity on how to be able to easily generate API documentation for our FHIR server- I know all the resource profiles I need. They will mostly point to the USCore profiles. What are people using out there? Thanks so much!</p>",
