Could you please give an advice on how to better map such table on a Fhir resource, maybe there are some examples? We are currently considering Group resource, and each group will consist of providers list registered with some health plan. We were thinking to reference health plan as Reference/Organisation, but there is no such reference object in Group resource. We would like to suggest you extend Group resource with a group.subject field which will be a reference to any Fhir object.</p>",

Each entryDefinition can be for example lab procedures. So you can have a list of the lab procedures that this institution supports, and how they are defined.</p>",
