The name is long in order to be explicit, and exclude the radiotherapy procedures, which is analysed by another group from Codex: Radiation Therapy Treatment Data for Cancer: <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/Radiation+Therapy+Treatment+Data+for+Cancer\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/Radiation+Therapy+Treatment+Data+for+Cancer</a>.<br>\nWe modelized the Radiation Summary for CT, X-Ray and NM using Observation profiles (one per use case): <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-radiation-dose-summary-ig/archi.html#profiles-relationship\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-radiation-dose-summary-ig/archi.html#profiles-relationship</a> . I think this can bring you ideas if you want to use the same modelization technique. We have not used procedure, as the matter for the Radiation Dose Summary IG is about reporting, and not about following the patient treatment; that is why the Codex team was more  about using Procedure than Observation resource (maybe things had changed, since our last discussion with codex team).</p>",
