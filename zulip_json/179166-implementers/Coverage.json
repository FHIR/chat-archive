We're hoping to be able to query what insurance provider(s) a patient is using, and so we were thinking we would be able to do GET /Coverage?subscriber=patient-id, but it doesn't seem like that is part of the standard. Anyone familiar with Coverage have any thoughts? I know it's still at maturity level 0 but it doesn't seem like an accidental omission.</p>",
