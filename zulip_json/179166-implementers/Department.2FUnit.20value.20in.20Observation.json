A clinical parameter has a department/unit/Location value to indicate where the registation was taken place.  Or it can be the responsible unit of the registation of the clinical parameters. Which eliment in observation profile i can use for this purpose ? Can I use the Observation.performer:PractitionerRole?</p>",
