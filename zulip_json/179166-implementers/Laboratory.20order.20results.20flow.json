I mean flow like some external organization or practitioner make an order to our laboratory for some patien for some tests. This external system should be able to recieve status of this order and retrieve results as soon as they ready. I found some examples but seems it is dstu2. If any for version 3 exists? </p>\n<p>Thnx alot.</p>",

This is something that will need to be nailed down in jurisdiction-specific implementation guides (and in some cases might vary between human, veterinary and environmental lab scenarios. </p>\n<p>In a pure REST scenario, a the Patient, ProcedureRequest and other resources would be on the placer's server or possibly some intermediary.  The Task would be posted into some location where the lab would be aware of it (either because it's posted directly to their system or posted to a system they monitor.  The lab would then update the Task to indicate whether the request had been received, accepted, rejected, etc.  However you could also make things work in a traditional messaging approach where you package up a whole bunch of resources and transfer them at once.</p>",
