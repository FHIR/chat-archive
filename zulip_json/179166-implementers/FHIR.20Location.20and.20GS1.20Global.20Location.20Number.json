We are looking to have a common identifier for physical locations in hospitals that can be used both for clinical logistics as well as service logistics and supplychain? I know the NHS works with GS1 GLN in that way, but I am not aware that they have implemented APIs with the FHIR location resource in such a context. Any information or experiences would be greatly appreciated.</p>",
