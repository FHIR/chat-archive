I could imagine adding a google translate fallback after that, as a suggestion to a human reviewer.<br>\nThis does not return a FHIR resource, but writes to an xls file in the format demanded by the MVC project.</p>\n<p>For the Dutch SNOMED translations, we have a selfbuilt service that can deduce a likely translation based on prior translations of the attributes/parents of the concept, but I don't think that will help here either. One of the options that we avoid for the sake of concordance, but as you already mentioned might be able to be of use, is an API connection to google translate. I don't know about your language, but the Dutch translation of most of the codes in <a href=\"https://terminology.hl7.org/1.0.0/CodeSystem-v3-MaritalStatus.html\">https://terminology.hl7.org/1.0.0/CodeSystem-v3-MaritalStatus.html</a> seems pretty viable to me.</p>\n<p>As to a service that assists in automated calls to google translate based on a FHIR CodeSystem... I'm afraid that would have to be a new DIY solution. I can imagine there is a demand for this! The API is no longer free AFAIK though...</p>",
