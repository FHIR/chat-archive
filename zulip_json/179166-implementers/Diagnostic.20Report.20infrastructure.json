As part of the requirement we are supposed to handle the Labs and Investigations (Orders as well as Reports)</p>\n<p>My understanding of FHIR Diagnostic Report is that it contains the data post the report is generated.. I wanted if any one has implemented this scenario where in one has to capture both Labs and Investigations orders as well as report details..</p>\n<p>I would like to know if there is a way to implement the whole infrastructure expecting it to be more an EHR system.</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nTrinadh..</p>",
