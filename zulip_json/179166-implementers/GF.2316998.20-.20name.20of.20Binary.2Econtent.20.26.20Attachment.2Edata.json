The simple answer is Binary name was driven by 'content-type' alignment where as Attachment.data was driven by alignment with the name used in the V3 data types. Neither of those are great reasons, and it would be nice to align them in a small way. But I don't think alignment justifies the cost of change in this case. Does anyone disagree?
