Every hospital at least in Germany needs to document timestamps of the operation as it unfolds (Cut, Suture, Anesthesia Start, Anesthesia End, ...), which is possible in every major Hospital Information System there is. Therefore I thought to create a thread for this, as this mandates a specific discussion in my opinion.</p>\n<p>Right now we ware creating an application, which urgently needs to support this feature and FHIR doesn't seem to have a straightforward way to do this, or at least there is some confusion about this topic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An extension has been made to support Incision time in a Procedure: procedure-incisionDateTime</li>\n<li>Some people recommend to create a number of procedures to for each phase --&gt; Bad, as there are many timestamps, which would each result in a Procedure for the same Procedure.Code that is being done on the patient (36 timestamps, in the standard we are using, ...)</li>\n<li>Some people talk about using the Procedure, but adding the timestamps in a later revision of FHIR</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Right now we are following this process (Simplified):</p>\n<p>1. Patient enters the hospital. Doctor diagnoses the Patient and creates a \"Condition\"<br>\n  2. Patient needs to be treated, doctor creates a ServiceRequest with the specific code that heals the patients \"Condition\"<br>\n  3. An appointment is set, when the ServiceRequest should be filled<br>\n  4. A Procedure documents the operation and fills the ServiceRequest with the same code.</p>\n<p>Major problem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No possibility to fill real timestamps in Procedure, like Cut, Suture, Anesthesia Start, ...</li>\n<li>No possibility to document planned timestamps in Appointment</li>\n</ul>",

Of course I want to track things like used material,  peformers, locations, but that is all there and can be done in one procedure. That way I also only have to track and update the status of one procedure, as it in preparation, in-progress and completed. </p>\n<p>I am able to track all performers that took part in the procedure and I really like that logic. The same I would like to do for timestamps, as they give a more detailed view on the \"in-progress\" status part of the procedure. </p>\n<p>In my understanding one procedure tracks the fulfilment of one Procedure.code, which might be a Snomed, OPS or ICD-10-PCS code. So I would like to say:  </p>\n<p>We are operating Patient A with the following procedure, which is documented in Procedure.code. This procedure goes through the lifecycle, as documented in Procedure.status. As soon as I set my Procedure to \"completed\" in Procedure.status, I know that the patient has undergone that Procedure. I don't want to look in multiple other 18 procedures or manage 18 other procedures. What I would do is, to create another Procedure, if two Procedure.code are operated on the patient in the same appointment, maybe even in parallel. That would make total sense and would be possible to handle from a data perspective. </p>\n<p>I could use the extension  progressStatus, but in my opinion, tracking timestamps for a procedure is a core requirement (As tracking timestamps is a legal requirement in Germany) and using the extension would definitely disqualify using the Procedure resource as a data saving format (Which I would very much like to do),  as it is not very suitable for performant queries.</p>",

To clarify a few questions. I will write a more complete reply in JIRA once I find time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Procedure.code should be used to name the code of the procedure, so what is being done on the patient. It would be confusing to insert a timestamp here in contained resources, as we are using Procedure.code in the main Procedure correctly</li>\n<li>I guess instead of occurence[x] you meant performed[x]?</li>\n<li>I would only need to specify which timestamp I am referencing and performedDateTime. Procedure.status is required, but I really don't want to track the correct status as of now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In my opinion this is not a clean and explicit solution, but a possible one anyway!</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>{\n    &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;Procedure&quot;,\n    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;mainSurgery&quot;,\n    &quot;contained&quot;: [\n        {\n            &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;Procedure&quot;,\n            &quot;id&quot;: &quot;prep&quot;,\n            &quot;partOf&quot;: [{&quot;reference&quot;: &quot;Procedure/mainSurgery&quot;}],\n            &quot;status&quot;: &quot;completed&quot;,\n            &quot;code&quot;: {\n                &quot;coding&quot;: [{&quot;code&quot;: &quot;#preparation&quot;}]},\n            &quot;occurrencePeriod&quot;: {\n                &quot;start&quot;: &quot;xxxxx&quot;,\n                &quot;end&quot;: &quot;yyyyy&quot;\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;Procedure&quot;,\n            &quot;id&quot;: &quot;anesthesia&quot;,\n            &quot;partOf&quot;: [{ &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;Procedure/mainSurgery&quot; }],\n            &quot;status&quot;: &quot;completed&quot;,\n            &quot;code&quot;: {\n                &quot;coding&quot;: [{ &quot;code&quot;: &quot;#anesthesia&quot;}]},\n            &quot;occurrencePeriod&quot;: {\n                &quot;start&quot;: &quot;xxxxx&quot;,\n                &quot;end&quot;: &quot;yyyyy&quot;\n            }\n        },\n...\n        {\n            &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;Procedure&quot;,\n            &quot;id&quot;: &quot;recovery&quot;,\n            &quot;partOf&quot;: [{\n            &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;Procedure/mainSurgery&quot;}],\n            &quot;status&quot;: &quot;completed&quot;,\n            &quot;code&quot;: {\n            &quot;coding&quot;: [{&quot;code&quot;: &quot;#recovery&quot;}]\n            },\n            &quot;occurrencePeriod&quot;: {\n                &quot;start&quot;: &quot;xxxxx&quot;,\n                &quot;end&quot;: &quot;yyyyy&quot;\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;completed&quot;,\n    &quot;code&quot;: {&quot;coding&quot;: [{&quot;code&quot;: &quot;#Appendectomy&quot;}]},\n    &quot;occurrencePeriod&quot;: {\n        &quot;start&quot;: &quot;xxxxx&quot;,\n        &quot;end&quot;: &quot;yyyyy&quot;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div>",
