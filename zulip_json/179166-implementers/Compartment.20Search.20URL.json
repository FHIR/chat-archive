What I understood about asterisk * that there would be multiple parameters. correct me if I am wrong? I am curious because it is the only place where the asterisk * is appearing in the URL pattern in search sections of spec.</p>\n<p>Q2. If I am right at Q1 then why not simply \"[id]{?[parameters]\" as \"parameters\" is written, which is also referring to multiple parameters?</p>\n<p>Q3. Why there is an extra forward slash \"/\" after \"[id]\" why not like this \"[id]{?[parameters]\"</p>",
