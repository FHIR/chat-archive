Michele is right that patient facing applications cannot be forced through validation. A patient has the right to chose an application of their choosing to access the data. NPRM calls out that health systems have the final authority on connected applications, but vendors cannot force themselves in the middle of that process. Applications that aren't validated are not listed on the app store. The app store is not a requirement to obtain access to the APIs, but some health systems do prefer to know that the app has been validated.</p>\n<p>With regards to statuses and safety. There is an oversimplification of the problem, and potentially clarification on what the daily life of an EHR vendor is like. I think there is a level of ambiguity on expectations around client/server query and response behaviors. In the example listed in this thread, we returned all medications that have a statuses. We <em>DO NOT</em> under any circumstances return medications that we do not know the status for even though unknown is in the value set. It is clinically unsafe, and we would be putting patient safety at risk. As an EHR vendor, we have responsibilities and processes in place that require us to  to take all preventative measures to mitigate these risks and liability. Another example would be data that has been changed to \"entered-in-error\". We do not return any fields to mitigates concerns around unintended re-disclosure of health information. We return an ID, a status, and all other required fields return displays of \"unknown\". This is done to understand state change, but nothing else. We will never expose additional details because of concerns around comments/notes that may lead to someone learning information that they shouldn't have known in the first place.</p>\n<p>I would ask that instead of trying to \"fix\" the behaviors of the different servers, we take a moment to understand scenarios in which EHRs would \"hide\" data, and why it is done. This would then allow the collective community to propose viable options that both mitigates risks, increase patient safety, and improve the exchange of data.</p>",

More specifically, I had an app for which historical med data was important -- so one vendor's choice to return only active medications caused some confusion in testing.  Developers of interoperable applications (like SMART Apps) cannot read the documentation of <em>every</em> Health IT product w/ a FHIR interface.  The point of standards is to allow some basic assumptions to be made -- and this specific topic (behavior of search queries) falls into that category for me.</p>\n<p>IMO, If we want to allow vendor variance in areas like this, then the FHIR spec should explicitly call out these areas where vendors are allowed to add their own rules.  That way responsible app developers who <em>do</em> know and understand the FHIR specification aren't burned and know to program more defensively in those spots.  And if this is allowed, then I think there needs to be a mechanism for the client to know that additional non-standard rules have been applied.

The EHRs created their interface with a presumption that it was going to be used by patient-centric apps and focused on meeting meaningful-use criteria - specifically the ability to share a list of a patient's active medicaitons.  But the MedicationRequest query endpoint isn't intrinsicly use-case specific and there are lots of valid use-cases for retrieving things other than the active med list (and for performing queries that aren't patient-centric).  It is certainly ok to have limintations in query parameters that focus on the initial use-cases for a first release, but default filtering for a presumed use-case is more problematic.  Lack of search parameters doesn't prevent a use-case from being satisfied, it just makes it inefficient.  But automatic filters can prevent a use-case from being predictably satisfied at all.  Eventually, the EHR MedicaionRequest endpoints will likely need to expose draft ordrs, recommendations that came in as part of a referral response from 5 years ago and all sorts of other MedicationRequest instances that have no relationship to the \"active medication list\" at all - but for which there's absolutely a valid use-case for exchange.  (And as that evolution happens, we'll start to see some of the pain of not having List to filter the sets of records that are truly part of the active med list as opposed to being resources that are part of the record for other reasons.)</p>",

They just want data, an if we gave that to them in a CSV, custom JSON/XML, HL7v2, or valid FHIR response, they wouldn't care either way.  They will never be parsing CapabilityStatement in a meaningful way.

Here are my observations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>One of the <em>most important principles</em> in safety is consistency. This is the entire point of Atul Gawande's book, The Checklist Manifesto. No matter the intention, we are actively creating and perpetuating a patent safety issue if the standard is inconsistently applied.<ul>\n<li>The example given by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191356\">@Jenni Syed</span> is perfect: \"I can provide the stat that 0 times has any app made it through our validation without an issue found\" - this is exactly the outcome I would expect with inconsistent implementations across vendors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>On the issue of the implementation itself, I don't have a super strong opinion. The current convention of passing along all data if no status is specified seems to be the most logical and future-proof (i.e., if a new status is ever added in the future, it would still work as expected), but explicitly requiring statuses would also be acceptable assuming it was implemented by everyone consistently.</li>\n<li>EHR vendors can't make assumptions about how data will be used by apps that consume the API. We ran into this early because some EHR vendors assumed data would be queried each time and never persisted. As has been mentioned, this is why returning entered-in-error and inactive status is critical vs simply not sending anything anymore.<ul>\n<li>As an example, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191764\">@Cooper Thompson</span> pointed out that one of their goals is to ensure that the data \"returned in the API matches what is shown to clinical users inside the EHR.\" This is reasonable on its face, but makes the assumption that all apps will behave like their EHR, or has the same access to historical data as their EHR.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Agree with comments above by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191469\">@Chris Moesel</span> that reading the documentation of all vendors doesn't scale. Does anyone believe that OAuth 2.0 implementors read the documentation of every site where it has been implemented, or do they refer to the IETF specs? Same should be true here - the US Core or Argonaut IGs should be the source(s) of truth for documentation.</li>\n<li>Data is not the responsibility of health systems or EHR vendors once it leaves the system, assuming the app developer is not a business associate of the covered entity. This question has been laid to rest ages ago and is described in more detail on <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/3009/does-a-hipaa-covered-entity-bear-liability.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/3009/does-a-hipaa-covered-entity-bear-liability.html\">the OCR FAQ page here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Where do we go from here? Some thoughts:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We should align on one approach. I agree with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191315\">@Josh Mandel</span> that it makes the most sense to do this as part of the base spec, although having the conversation as part of the Argonaut R4 discussions would also be fine, assuming the outcome was applied to the base spec.</li>\n<li>It would be more valuable to provide a comprehensive safety overview/how-to for inexperienced developers along with a consistent API than it would be to attempt to protect developers from themselves in inconsistent and dangerous ways (which is current state). Agree with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194368\">@Julie Maas</span> that we should try something like this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tagging <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197491\">@Dave deBronkart</span> as well.</p>",

        "content": "<p>This is such an important topic! I fully agree that apps should understand and properly handle the full resource life cycle, especially the entered-in-error status. With regard to apps that locally persist resources, I think we also need to look carefully at other ways resources may become \"invalid\" with respect to an app's use case where resource status might not communicate this. A few observations:<br>\n1. It seems to me that any time a resource element that is a Reference is updated, this could cause resources to no longer be valid for the app's use case, and could also prevent the app from receiving any future updates about status changes. In the simplest example, if an Observation resource is updated to change the subject reference, it will no longer be a valid Observation for the original patient and will simply disappear for an app that only has access to the original subject's Observations (i.e. the app will not receive a status change).<br>\n2. I expect some will argue that a server should never allow the subject of an Observation to be updated, and should instead mark the original resource as entered-in-error and create a second resource with the correct subject reference, but I don't think that this part of the formal FHIR spec (? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> ). It gets more difficult to manage when apps rely on chaining in their searches, so if such a rule were imposed in the interest of safety, it should probably be extended to prohibit changing any element of an existing resource that is a reference. I don't think such a rule would be very popular.<br>\n3. It gets even worse if an app is \"deauthorized\" from a particular resource after it has retrieved it, because if that resource's status is later changed to entered-in-error or the resource is otherwise changed in a clinically relevant way, the app will not receive the update.<br>\n4. Patient unmerge/unlink: similar to #1.<br>\n5. Given the above, it seems that there is no easy way for an app to be certain it is synchronized with a server's database using only RESTful calls; to be fully protected from the above, it may need to repeat queries for all data it wishes to persist every time and remove or otherwise invalidate any locally persisted resources that had \"disappeared\" from the search results. It seems like this might be a best practice from a safety perspective. Grahame touched on this earlier in the thread in the context of medication lists.<br>\n6. It follows from 5 that apps that use a _lastUpdated parameter in their searches set relative to their last search would have no way to determine that a previously retrieved resource had disappeared, and are vulnerable to persisting data that becomes clinically invalid for one of the above reasons.</p>",
