When I down and up db container, I lost data which I register manually and have data which exist before I register anything. For example, when I start the container first time I have a lot of patients. I deleted all patients and register only one using fhirbase_create function. Now I execute docker-compose down &amp;&amp; docker-compose up -d and I have all of patients I deleted and the patient I register before is lost!</p>\n<p>I checked volumes at docker-compose.yml but it seems it is correct. What I am doing wrong??</p>",
