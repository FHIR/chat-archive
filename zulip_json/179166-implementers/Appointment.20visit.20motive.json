Sure, my visit motive is linked to my appointment but it is also a standalone resource in my app because you can CRUD it. A value set doesn't allow me to do all these actions on my visit motives that is why I can't use one and why I'm asking to create a \"new resourceType\". Here is the schema of my \"visitMotive\" a.k.a reason : <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/nECvfxqh\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://pastebin.com/nECvfxqh\">pastebin.com/nECvfxqh</a> </p>\n<p>I've started a post on StackOverflow for this matter and already talked with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> about it.
