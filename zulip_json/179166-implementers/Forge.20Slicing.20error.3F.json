One for the Sensor Device and another for the PHG Device. I tried slicing the Device reference within the PCHAObservation Profile (<a href=\"https://simplifier.net/PCHAprofiles/PCHAObservation/rendered\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://simplifier.net/PCHAprofiles/PCHAObservation/rendered\">https://simplifier.net/PCHAprofiles/PCHAObservation/rendered</a>). The Forge tool tells me that I either needs to add a Discriminator or a Definition for the slice (my guess is that the Definition is called Description within the Forge tool because if I make a description the error message goes a way). My description says that one reference sould reference the SensorDevice and the other should reference the PHGDevice. So far so good.</p>\n<p>However If I save my profile and load it back into the Forge tool, the Description is missing and I receive the same error that the slice needs a Discriminator or a definition, so I have to add the description/definition every time i load up my profile in the Forge tool. I guess this is a bug. </p>",

We are planning to publish a new release and this fix will be included. As for the eld-1 validation message, the text is taken from the official definition of the eld-1 invariant on ElementDefinition:<br>\n<a href=\"http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/elementdefinition.html#tabs-ElementDefinition\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/elementdefinition.html#tabs-ElementDefinition\">http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/elementdefinition.html#tabs-ElementDefinition</a><br>\nI see how this can be a bit confusing. Maybe you can submit a QA issue to GForge in order to update the description of the eld-1 invariant from \"definition\" to \"description\"?</p>",
