First thing we're doing is getting a list of appointments for the day, and from there we'd need to get the demographics of the patients for all appointments. Should we send a read request for every patient id, or is there a better way to get a bundle of all of them in a single request? Maybe use an _include in the appointments search?</p>",

Unfortunately the server doesn't support _include, and also returns an error when using the multiple _ids parameter in the search query (sigh). I think i'll just manually READ every patient, sending multiple asynchronous requests and getting the responses. :)</p>",
