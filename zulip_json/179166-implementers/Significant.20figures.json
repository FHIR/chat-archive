In the examples of number search, specifically for the first and third examples (Values that equal 100, to 3 significant figures precision, so this is actually searching for values in the range [99.5 ... 100.5)) and (Values that equal 100, to 1 significant figures precision, so this is actually searching for values in the range [95 ... 105)) seem to be contrary to the definition of significant figures. <br>\nFor #1, In my experience, leading zeroes in a decimal and trailing zeroes in an integer do not count as significant (ie 100 is 1 significant figure, not 3)<br>\nFor #3, all the other examples of sig figs in the FHIR Number Search examples  seem to take the sig figs, add one significant digit of 5 in either direction. However, the third example adds two significant digits and then 5. (ie i think the range should be [50, 150) )</p>",
