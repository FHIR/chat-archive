Location indicates the URL of a redirect, while Content-Location indicates the direct URL to use to access the resource, without further content negotiation in the future. Location is a header associated with the response, while Content-Location is associated with the data returned. This distinction may seem abstract without examples.\"</p>\n<p>I searched this page <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/http.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/http.html\">http://build.fhir.org/http.html</a> for location header, but found no mentioned of Content-Location.</p>\n<p>what should we use?</p>",
