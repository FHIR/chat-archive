Think the backend side is covered quite well, so the blanc spot is still frontend. What would help would be a Blog or story that explain about frontend like this story does for storage <a href=\"https://www.health-samurai.io/articles/should-you-use-fhir-resources-as-your-data-storage-format\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.health-samurai.io/articles/should-you-use-fhir-resources-as-your-data-storage-format\">https://www.health-samurai.io/articles/should-you-use-fhir-resources-as-your-data-storage-format</a>. </p>\n<p>Anyway we found out about FHIRJs <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-fhirjs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-fhirjs\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-fhirjs</a> and for instance Meteor <a href=\"https://github.com/clinical-meteor\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/clinical-meteor\">https://github.com/clinical-meteor</a>.  Think there will be more tools that we should know about, so we would be glad to hear.</p>\n<p>Think it is a steep learning curve..:-), but we are getting there. Many thank to the Zulip users anyway!</p>",
