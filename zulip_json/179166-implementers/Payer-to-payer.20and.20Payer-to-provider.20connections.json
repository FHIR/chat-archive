The patient would need to provide their prior plan's coverage information, including member id, to the current plan. This information will be forwarded to the old plan and used to help identify the patient in the old system. Once the information is received by the new plan, the new plan will store this information on behalf of the patient.</p>\n<p>Based upon what I said above, it seems that each data holder will need to develop an application, register that application with every other data holder, and then this payer-to-payer/payer-to-provider exchange network could function. Until these connections are built I am not seeing how this will work. Even in a world with automatic registration, the sheer volume of connections is staggering. Am I missing a key component that makes this process a lot easier than it currently seems to me? </p>\n<p>The converse approach, which does not require every single data holder to connect with every other single data holder, is to have a patient store all information on their device and share it as needed. I am still learning, but the legwork to build out the network (connections/registrations/endpoint awareness) for all data holders seemed best approached as infrastructure.  </p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

This only conflates my original question, as now we are supporting the same number of connections, but using a bulk API as well. The only way I could wrap my head around supporting that number of connections to a FHIR server would be to use an Open Auth method, like SMART. </p>\n<p>It sure would be nice to allow a trusted application, that has already done the leg work of building all the connections, to publish information as needed to either payers or providers. This would limit the number of connections drastically. This would also prevent the health insurance companies from becoming a gatekeep for a patient's data.

I am basically proposing that for this to work, everyone would at least need to use an identity and authorization method that we can all agree upon. Otherwise this becomes untenable. This ruling must be applied by each impacted payer, which can be burdensome for smaller plan, e.g. a state based Medicaid plan.

(Not an expert, just my hot take) For payers that create B2B relationships and trusted connections would be able to use the PDex IG. Without the B2B relationship, maybe we could also meet this requirement by beefing up the CARIN BB claims API. This could involve defining how to represent prior authorizations in a uniform way, that 'everyone' agrees to honor.

        "content": "<p>I am just catching up on this thread so forgive me if I haven't absorbed everything. But let me start with some of the assumptions that have been made around PDex and Payer-to-Payer exchange to see if that helps this discussion.<br>\nPDex did not address the endpoint discovery and credentialing of payer access to other payer endpoints. <br>\nI believe this is something that could be addressed through some FAST initiatives (if they are FAST enough... :.) sorry - couldn't resist!)<br>\nThe CAQH Endpoint Discovery initiative seems to be moving oil the right direction. If it is coupled with certificates that utilize UDAP to perform trusted Dynamic registration we have the start of a solution for discovery. The issuing of certificates then becomes largely a policy/Trust issue between payers.<br>\nPDex addressed the first step of Payer-to-Payer by defining a member-match operation that would enable payers to utilize patient demographics and coverage information to determine a unique match. This is something payers do everyday, or they wouldn't be able to settle claims. PDex did not try to define HOW payers accomplish the match, just to provide the inputs and specified an output from a unique match.<br>\nThe result of a unique match should return a Unique member id for the payer (and most likely an access token) that would enable the requesting payer to access the Patient Access API to access USCore/PDex profiles for the specific patient.<br>\nThis all pre-supposes that: 1) The member at the requesting plan has provided the prior coverage information. 2) The payer has access to an endpoint directory that can identify the FHIR endpoint for the $member-match based on the coverage plan details.<br>\nWould the member portal or plan url found on many voergage cards be a good value to search an endpoint directory on?<br>\nPDex also did not prevent the use of Bulk FHIR . We see that as something the industry might move towards as Payer-to-payer exchange expands. Could payers support a /Patient/{id}/$everything operation that could gather all information for a patient. Could that optionally be returned as ndjson? <br>\nWe attempted to define the $member-match transaction so that payer-to-payer could be handled via alternate exchange mechanisms that payers may have in use.<br>\nOne area I think we do need to consider is how a plan can validate an access request sent via a payer on behalf of a member. There are some edge cases that could be problematical. For example. How does a plan enable a parent to request Data on behalf of a minor. And how do the plans determine that the requesting parent is authorized to have access to the Childs data. This can be an issue in the case of divorced parents.<br>\nWhen I think about Payer-to-Payer exchange the problem comprises three parts. 1) the Interaction - this is what we attempted to address with PDex using $Member-Match (which is now in the HRex IG since it is planned to be used across multiple IGs). 2) Discovery - How do I find the right endpoint to be able to perform the required interaction. and 3) Policy/Contract - How will plans enable access to a trusted plan once the endpoint is identified.<br>\n$member-match is not trying to define the follow -on exchange of data. It simply determines if a payer is able to find a unique match for a member and if so how to reference the member in their system. Individual IGs will then handle the data queries based upon the use cases they are supporting. This was successfully proven when PCDE and PDex both used $member-match to support different  data exchange use cases.</p>",

My thought exercise is below, I hope this can be helpful. </p>\n<p>Regarding identity: when systems are talking with each other the primary means of sending the identity of the application user is by using OAuth. Since the current healthcare system will have a unique identity within each system, additional effort is required to match the identities between systems. This is similar to how I have a Gmail identity and a Yahoo identity. Both of these identities are describing the same person, but from a systems perspective I have multiple identities. In the absence of an identity token a similar effect could be achieved by communicating patient demographics and identifiers through a trusted connection (UDAP). Assuming that the system receiving a PHI request can trust the identity information of the system requesting PHI, the system fulfilling the data request may perform a patient match operation to help workaround the lack of a universal identity. This allows both systems to associate an identity in their system with the request, if the match is successful.</p>\n<p>Regarding authorization: now that we have partially solved identity, we can begin to think about authorizing access to PHI for the identity. In payer-to-X, the system requesting PHI from another system will not have a way to validate the access rights to the information being requested. This would require both systems to have a common understanding of application user's role/access rights. Since the party that is requesting PHI will have no way of knowing what is allowed, they will need to rely upon the system that is providing data to validate access rights to the PHI. The entity providing PHI will also need to trust that the application user is making an honest request. The system attempting to validate access to their PHI must be able to associate the received identity information with a role in their system via a lookup operation. Once an identity and the associated permissions/restrictions is determined, the data sender will be able to apply authorization rules. </p>\n<p>When you get into scenarios that allow a provider/clinician/administrator to access data, it becomes much more complex. The identity matching operation must also take into account NPI, TIN/LOCATION, specialty, position on care team, and etc. Just because a provider has access to a patient at one location does not mean they have access to that patients data from all sources. This needs to be patient directed. </p>\n<p>The example I gave above is my best attempt at making a payer-to-X exchange of data function, with current capabilities. I even assumed that we managed to get UDAP implemented across the board and it still seems like an impossible task. I hope this can make it clear why peer to peer connections in healthcare  would be impossible without first developing consensus, and universally implementing solutions around identity and authorization. And as I said before, I struggle to see how this peer to peer infrastructure is better than a member/patient centric approach.</p>\n<p>If we can meet all of the use cases, improve security, empower the patient, help the ecosystem, and eliminate waste it seems we should pursue this. I understand B2B connections are useful, but I cannot understand the need to make these connections mandatory to support patient directed use cases.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Here is an outline of the points I am considering for a formal comment. I am looking for community feedback (let me know if I should move this): </p>\n<p>The 1/1/2022 payer-to-payer and the prior auth proposed rules cannot be implemented securely by payers until a few key pieces of infrastructure are in place. There are at least three healthcare infrastructure challenges and some procedure issues that preclude the creation of a healthcare peer-to-peer network. Currently the payer community can only securely communicate healthcare data through business-to-business connections and directly to our members/patients.</p>\n<p>The payer implementer community does not posses a uniform understanding of the specific implementation details for payer-to-payer and payer-to-provider connections and transfer of data. Technical issues were overlooked or understated. We are rushing to implement industry wide changes with no clear benefit to our patients/members, the primary individual this rule is intended to benefit. Furthermore, I believe the community has made a mistake by removing the member/patient from the center of healthcare data transfers. The data transferred for the interoperability use cases is for the benefit of the member/patient. We are introducing unnecessary complexity, introducing security vulnerabilities, increasing implementation costs, and delivering an inferior product to our patients/members.</p>\n<p>The technical issues are as follows: </p>\n<p><strong>1.) There is a better solution</strong><br>\nThe solutions proposed for payer-to-payer and payer-to-provider are needlessly complex. We did not seem to consider using the application development ecosystem to help solve some of the industry-wide problems impacting the member directed exchange of healthcare data between healthcare data holders. Using an application, like Apple Health or Common Health, will enable you to have access to all your healthcare information in a single location. </p>\n<p>A patient centric approach is vastly more secure than the proposals made to facilitate payer-to-payer exchanges of data. I have not yet heard discussions about how we plan to support payer-to-provider, but I am confident it will be even more challenging than setting up a payer-to-payer, member facilitated, exchange network.</p>\n<p>The payer-to-payer use cases for 1/1/2022 can be met with minimal effort by the application developer community and the payers and with no additional effort from the member/patient. The primary objective of the 1/1/2022 payer-to-payer use case is to allow a patient/member to have a single place to access all of their healthcare data. This use case is met by connecting an aggregator application to all data sources. Introducing payers into the mix, to aggregate payer data, does not simplify the process for patients/members. </p>\n<p>The current suggested approach, where members get their historical data via a payer-to-payer and payer-to-provider exchange network, necessitates the following: <br>\n•   creation of complex trust and endpoint discovery frameworks<br>\n•   industry wide-consensus on how to identify and validate access to healthcare data<br>\n•   the creation of FHIR applications by every healthcare data holder (this is in addition to the FHIR servers we will all be exposing) <br>\n•   Limiting the patient’s/member's ability to choose, at a granular level, what information to share between payers/providers<br>\n•   Receiving data in non-FHIR formats from prior payers, which will prevent true interoperability<br>\n•   Building out infrastructure that is only accessible through an insurance provider</p>\n<p>We can meet the payer-to-payer use cases without creating any new payer-to-payer or payer-to-provider connections. The advantage of this approach is that it allows all healthcare data holders to use existing connections to communicate with the only entity in healthcare that everyone has already agreed to trust, our patients/members. This approach also places the patient/member at the center of all healthcare data transactions, both in a literal and figurative sense. Additionally, this approach is widely supported by industry leaders like Apple Health and Common Health, both of which seem well situated to add support for Payer-to-Patient and Patient-to-Payer/Provider flows. This approach is also superior because it allows application developers to focus on writing code, instead of building out and maintaining thousands of connections. </p>\n<p><strong>2.) Endpoint Discovery and Trusted Connections</strong><br>\nPayer-to-payer and payer-to-provider will require peer-to-peer trusted communications. Each payer will need to be aware of all other trusted endpoint’s and be able to associate a member request with one of these trusted endpoints. This obstacle is being addressed through efforts such as UDAP (Unified Data Access Profiles). </p>\n<p>A trust framework, like UDAP, will solve the issues of endpoint discovery and trusted connections, but this approach has not been universally agreed upon in healthcare. Once consensus is formed, a considerable nationwide lift will be required to implement UDAP for all impacted healthcare data sources. Manual processes and case-by-case application vetting can be used instead of an automated process like UDAP. The number of connections and maintenance costs associated with a manual approach will be untenable however. </p>\n<p>Peer-to-peer connections also necessitate that each payer/provider creates an application and registers that application with every other impacted healthcare data holder. The payer will also have every other data holder registering an application with the payer. This web of connections assumes a lot of trust and, if poorly implemented, seems to introduce significant security risks. These risks would be in addition to the risks outlined below.</p>\n<p><strong>3.) Consistent Identifiers Across Systems</strong><br>\nThe identifiers we use to track entities in healthcare data are not consistent across systems. For example, the patient identifier I am given at one health system will not be the same as the one I am given at another health system. This is because each system defines their own identifiers. The industry has not yet agreed upon a consistent approach. This will probably not be addressed soon. It is currently illegal to require the use of a universal patient identifier in all systems. </p>\n<p>In payer-to-payer, the leading proposal to solve the identifier issue is to have a plan’s current enrollee provide their prior plans member Id. This member Id, when combined with the member’s demographic data, should enable the prior plan to locate an identifier in their system that will correspond with the person who is requesting data. This proposal may work in most cases, but it has not yet been universally agreed upon as a solution, and this solution is specific to a single use case. We would need to develop another solution to define a cross-system compatible way of identifying a healthcare provider. This will be more complex because a single provider may have multiple identities, each with different access rights.</p>\n<p><strong>4.) Ability to Authorize Access</strong><br>\nFor a system to protect sensitive data the system will need to know who is requesting the information. This will allow the system to determine if the application user making the request has access to the requested data. In system-to-system communications, like we see in payer-to-payer and payer-to-provider, all connected systems will need to know what access rights an actor in one system may have in another system. Authorization also presupposes the existence of trusted connections, endpoint awareness for all data holders and applications, and an agreed upon understanding of how to identify the requestor. I am not aware of any efforts to enable cross-system data access awareness.</p>\n<p>In the absence of a consistent way to validate access rights in a cross-system compatible way security vulnerabilities could be created. The burden of authorization will be placed on the payer who is providing the data. The system requesting data could fabricate identity information and effectively have access to any PHI in the sending system, if they can provide enough identity information to enable a demographics match. A malicious application user could also easily request data that they do not have access to by manipulating the request data. Given the hundreds of data sources we are adding it seems likely that at least one of the sources will introduce a vulnerability.</p>\n<p>As stated before, business-to-business communications, in this current model, require significant trust. This is because we are creating a system where one actor can declare that they possess an identity in another system, and the other system is required to trust this assertion. A malicious application or end user could easily take advantage of this by providing identity and demographic information that will allow them access to the information they are trying to steal. Since applications can register directly with data holders and the use of a trust framework is not required, it seems that a malicious actor could create an application and manually register that application with a healthcare data holder. We are currently prohibited from blocking an application from accessing our API unless we can demonstrate a security risk to our system. This gap seems the most dangerous.  </p>\n<p>A patient centric model is more secure because the system that is providing sensitive data is also the system that is issuing the identity and validating access rights. This process will eliminate the trust issues associated with a third-party created identity. The data holder will also be able to utilize existing identity management security processes, e.g. multi-factor authentication.</p>",

These applications have been building the connections that will enable a single application to connect to multiple sources. A patient/member would meet this use case by connecting the application of their choice to all historical data sources. There is no new information about a member/patient generated as a direct result of the payer-to-payer aspect of this rule so the patient would have access to all information, in one place. This approach is also superior because it will result in a more complete medical history. A member who relied on payer-to-payer data exchange to pull clinical data would only have a small fraction of the available clinical data. The data a member can access from provider sources will be more complete than the subset of clinical data that a payer may maintain for the patient/member.</p>\n<p>•   Proposed - Documentation Requirements for Prior Auths: This does not seem like it will be protected/confidential information. If so, it can be exposed through a public api, which will remove the trust and authorization issues present in current payer-to-payer designs.</p>\n<p>•   Proposed - Ability to check status of Prior Auths: A member would use an application of their choice to directly search the prior authorization status. The status could then be sent directly to the provider or communicated to the provider by the patient. This will require the creation of a new FHIR implementation guide, and this can be included as part of the patient access API.</p>\n<p>•   Proposed - Ability to communicate roster to providers: This use case could be met if all the patients relevant to the provider have connected to the provider. The provider would have a one to many connection relationship that is enabled by the patients that have connected with the provider. Patients that choose to connect to the provider will be able to send data to the provider, essentially building a roster that patients had to opt into (member/patient opt in)</p>\n<p>•   Seeking Comment - Ability to more easily transfer prior authorizations between payers: (Not an expert, just my hot take) Maybe we could also meet this requirement by beefing up the CARIN Blue Button Claims API to include a prior authorization indicator, e.g. a prior authorization number that is tied to a specific procedure code. It seems that this would just require industry consensus and inclusion into an implementation guide. The exchange of this data would be member facilitated, by using an application that is connected to both the old and new payer.</p>\n<p>Here is an image to summarize how the current payer-to-payer and payer-to-provider use cases could be met without creating a peer-to-peer network: <br>\n<a href=\"user_uploads/10155/3IvlVGcMwKF0tMYFDEF2UHpO/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/10155/3IvlVGcMwKF0tMYFDEF2UHpO/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"user_uploads/10155/3IvlVGcMwKF0tMYFDEF2UHpO/image.png\"></a></div><p>Here is another image that summarizes how payer-to-payer and payer-to-provider exchange networks will increase complexity, with no clear benefit to the patient/member: <br>\n<a href=\"user_uploads/10155/8fxejXrq-GkzQBe5cI7B9GD1/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/10155/8fxejXrq-GkzQBe5cI7B9GD1/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"user_uploads/10155/8fxejXrq-GkzQBe5cI7B9GD1/image.png\"></a></div>",

The end result of all of this is to get the most complete medical picture and to share that information in a way that best serves the patient's needs. The code that is written on top of a complete patient concept is extremely valuable. The more complete we can get this single picture the more valuable it will become. The economy of scale for developing against the patient is two-fold. By combining all data sources at the patient you will get the most complete picture. Additionally, when all data sources converge on the patient then application developers will have a much larger user base to develop against that is using a common dataset (Cigna Users + Epic Users + etc).</p>\n<p>I cannot make cool apps if they can only interface with a single EHR or Payer, and each data source has a different data set. Instead I want to write code against a patient, and their connections. That way we will always be building upon this same concept and we will begin to eliminate the throwaway work that is currently occurring on top of partial data sources. When I was at a prior position, working to run measure calculations for ~1000 health systems, we always wanted a complete medical chart. The issue was that even if we combined all of the data, no single health system, NPI, TIN, etc. could access the complete record. This information would need to be authorized and released by the patient. Since we did not have a relationship with the patient the idea couldn't go anywhere.</p>",

CMS bluebutton is is able to avoid all of these issues by having a universal identifier and by just being CMS. When you are as large as CMS you are essentially an aggregator (when viewed in context of current ecosystem). Some large payers may be able to combine their networks (BCBSA could do this I imagine) into something fierce. But that is terrifying and counterproductive for everyone.</p>",

They are specified to allow these specific types of PurposeOfUse. What is missing is the will of 'some' the custodian participants on these networks to respond when a partner indicates they are using the payer or patient purposeOfUse. So it is policy, not technology or a specification problem.</p>",

Can someone share a link please? I would be interested in the relationship between payer nodes (and application end users) and their role awareness, and how member identifiers are trusted between payer nodes.</p>\n<p>The current proposal is only addressing new information exchanges, that will require an opt-in from a patient/member and I agree this seem to be a better fit for B2C2B (Ill use this now haha). </p>\n<p>They are also establishing groundwork (unofficially) for a B2B network, which the community comment is also arguing can be met using facilitator (patient/member/provider) established connections (when opt-in is required) or through existing B2B connections. An application sitting outside of data sources, with a strong identity concept to unify things, is very powerful.</p>",

Let me know if this makes sense.</p>\n<p>Provider Access API is redefined to mean a Provider Hosted API that can accept data about a patient. In technical terms, this would be the PUT endpoint of their existing Patient Access API. The PUT endpoints would function based upon FHIR IGs (need created), and the application used would directly mediate the transfer of data between data holders. The application can be a business application to allow the HIPAA protections to continue.</p>\n<p>Payer Access API will have a similar definition, but it is hosted by payers.</p>\n<p>Patient Access API is redefined to indicate all outbound communications about a patient. In technical terms, we can authorize this access in many ways, but the universal solution that already exists is the launch/patient SMART flow, with patient scope.</p>\n<p>Member facilitated use cases can be met using the patient-centric connection and payer/provider trusted applications. The application will directly mediate transfer, and the actual movement of data will occur within an application created by a Payer or Provider. This seems to address the HIPAA issues that were omitted in the officially submitted comment. </p>\n<p>In effect, this gives us everything in the current policy, as currently stated, with some minor technical clarifications to language (which products numerous positive results and saves the healthcare system a ton of $$ and throw-away work).</p>\n<p>Is it too late to provide clarification? It seems the process will take time, and research is part of the policy maker's due diligence.</p>",
