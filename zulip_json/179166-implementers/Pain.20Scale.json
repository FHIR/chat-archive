You'll need to put an extension on CodeSystem.concept with a name like \"graphicDesignation\" of type Attachment which would then either contain or point to the relevant images.  (Please submit a change request for us to define a standard extension for this purpose, as it's a relatively common need.)  Your value set would then select all (or a subset) of the codes having an image representation.  And your profile on Observation would bind Observation.value to that value set.</p>",
