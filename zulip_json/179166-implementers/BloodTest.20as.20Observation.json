I'm using FHIR 1.0.2 and I  mapped this table  as Observation resource where the Observation.code is the snomed of bloodtest while the single exams are components (code and value). According FHIR Observation constraints Observation.dataabsentreason  SHALL only be present if Observation.value[x] is not present.  <br>\nWhich values  must I set in Observation.dataabsentreason among  unknow, asked, temp, not-asked, masked, unsupported, astext, error and Nan? In Observation.value[x] there is any value because the are all in the components. Can some help me?</p>",
