        "content": "<p>I agree Eric. I was not saying one should stop progressing without them. But more that they need to step up or not. I modeled the IEEE 11073 model in a FHIR resource two years ago (exactly), prior to my layoff from GE. It is easy, but is a standalone Resource that holds all the ECG evidence, while using Observation for what Observation is good at. I would love to submit it... (It likely needs a bit of alignment to current FHIR build) -- that said, the consensus process of HL7 is what must be followed. Consensus means involvement, and progress based on who participates.</p>",
