AllergyIntolerance has a criticality which is an estimate of the harm to the identified substance while the reaction has a severity which is the specific severity of that reaction.  A common example that highlights the difference is an allergy to bee stings.  The reaction could have a severity of 'mild' but the criticality of the allergy is 'high' since it is expected that subsequent bee stings will get more and more severe.</p>",
