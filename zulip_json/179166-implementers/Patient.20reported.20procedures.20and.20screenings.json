Is this using the Procedure.asserter field, and filling this in with the reference Patient?</p>\n<p>In my organization, we partner with different health systems. For the purposes of quality reporting, some of these health systems allow patient reported data without further documentation (i.e. \"Yes I had a colonoscopy screening six months ago\")</p>\n<p>But other health systems are stricter and will only accept procedures that include documentation from the originating provider (i.e. an accompanying fax, or a C-CDA, etc).</p>\n<p>We are a primary care facility, so many of these procedures / screenings are performed by a third party, with who we may or may not have interoperability worked out. As a result we have a mix of patient reported and also fully documented procedures and screenings. </p>\n<p>Just wanted to ensure I flag these patient reported screenings correctly. If there's already a thread for this could someone point me that way?</p>",

But we have a similar situation in our system (mixed \"official\"/patient-reported data). I was wondering if this could also be solved using Provenance. Provenance is <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-provenance.html\">profiled in US Core</a>, with <code>agent.type</code> and <code>agent.who</code> being must-support. So for patient-reported source, one could add a Provenance resource with an <code>agent</code> entry having <code>type</code> = \"author\" and <code>who</code> pointing to the Patient resource, to indicate that the patient is responsible for the information in the target resource. If I read it right, this seems to match the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/basic-provenance.html#hie-redistribution\">Health Information Exchange (HIE) use case</a> from the US Core basic provenance page.</p>\n<p>Of course, this all requires such Provenance resource to be (consistently) available, plus all systems have to search for matching Provenances rather than just looking in the resource itself when they want this information.</p>",
