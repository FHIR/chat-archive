As far as I saw the identifier search is TOKEN based search so it is not possible to do that. Do you have any consideration about such kind of functionality? I have implemented separate API service (implementation of CQRS pattern) which uses HAPI FHIR implementation. So one of the variants is to make the search internally by getting all the patients and filter over them, but it seems that this is not so convenient. <br>\nThanks in advance.</p>",
