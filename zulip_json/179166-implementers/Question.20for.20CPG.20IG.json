They are specified to apply to Attachments in clinical reasoning because they were originally associated with Documentation, but reconciliation of comments in the CPG-IG has resulted in them being moved to the <code>action</code> element of a PlanDefinition. <a href=\"http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30114\">J#30114</a> supports applying this expansion to the FHIR extensions.</p>",
