My surname is often pronounced Polish (there it sounds like Pschisucha), although it is Prussian (there it is more link Prezucha). <br>\nAnd I also live in an area, where \"e\" sometimes is used to lengthen a vocal, e.g. Laer is pronounced like Laar (long a like in Russia). In other regions in Germany ae would be pronounced like \"Ã¤\", so Laer wound sound like \"lair\". </p>\n<p>To summarize: Names can be pronounced totally different in different languages, and sometimes a language isn't even clear on how to pronounce a name properly due to regional issues. So I am curious about your solution.</p>",
