We plan to use the Specimen resource for our samples and want to distinguish between different \"superclasses\" of samples (e.g. liquid, tissue), each of which has several sub-types (e.g. blood, tears). The only difference between the classes profile-wise is that is that for liquids, there is no bodySite attribute. Is it \"better\" FHIR to define different profiles for each superclass OR use a hierarchical ValueSet and one common profile with a FHIRpath constraint (using the \"subsumes\" operator) on bodySite ? Thanks!</p>",

Profiles never convey \"data\" - the fact it was a liquid must be conveyed by the codes already in the instance.  That said, typically you need to differentiate arterial vs. venous blood, might care which abscess fluid was drawn from, etc. - so I'm not sure if it's wise to say that fluid will never have a body site (though accept that it might not be mandatory).</p>",
