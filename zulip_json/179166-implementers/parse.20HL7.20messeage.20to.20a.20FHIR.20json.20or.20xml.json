HL7 has published four main standards over its history.  HL7 v2 was a healthcare messaging standard that is normally conveyed in a custom format, i.e. not XML.  HL7 v3 was a healthcare messaging standard that is conveyed in XML (but it did not get a large uptake so you probably aren't talking about that).  HL7 CDA was based on v3 but is a Document standard.  It is also conveyed in XML.  CCDA stands for Consolidated CDA and is an Implementation Guide that provides a bunch of templates of HL7 CDA.  To answer your questions:<br>\n1) No, HL7 messages are not CCDA.  HL7 messages will either be V2 or V3.  Any of the CCDA defined documents will be a HL7 CDA document and therefore not a HL7 v2 or v3 message.<br>\n2) You will need to convert the HL7 v2 or v3 message into FHIR.  There is no library that automatically does this because there is so many different types of v2 or v3 messages.  Similarly, there is no library that automatically does a conversion of CDA documents into FHIR documents.  Work is being done on a standard set of v2 to FHIR conversions and a standard set of CDA to FHIR conversions, but that work is not complete yet.</p>",
