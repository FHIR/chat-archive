I have been checking out the <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-ethnicity.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-ethnicity.html\">US Core Ethnicity extension</a>. I have noticed that it has a must support for the ombCategory, which categorizes the ethicity into either 'Hispanic or Latino' or 'Non Hispanic or Latino'. We do not capture this in our source system, we only capture the actual ethnicity, which can be free-texted. Now I could try and build some logic to parse the free-text to see if I can determine if it is hispanic or latino, but this really does not matter to us. What would you recommend in this case?</p>",

The project is in the very beginning, but I believe Aboriginal/First Nations Status, Ethnicity and Gender Identity would likely be some of the first topics once we reach a consensus on the methodology. It would be great if you can bring your business requirements. The group meets every other Friday at 2 pm. The next meeting is on <a href=\"https://infocentral.infoway-inforoute.ca/en/news-events/event-calendar/icalrepeat.detail/2019/04/12/2928/-/canadian-fhir-baseline-profiles-workstream\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://infocentral.infoway-inforoute.ca/en/news-events/event-calendar/icalrepeat.detail/2019/04/12/2928/-/canadian-fhir-baseline-profiles-workstream\">April 12th</a>.</p>",
