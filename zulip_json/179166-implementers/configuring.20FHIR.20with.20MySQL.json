What, exactly, are you trying to do?  Where are you running into trouble?  Are you asking if anyone's already done something before that you could beg/borrow/steal?  If so, you need to be clear about what you're looking for.  As it stands now, this would fall into the category of a \"Could you please do my homework?\" question, which are frowned upon here.</p>",
