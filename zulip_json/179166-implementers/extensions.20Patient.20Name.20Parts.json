I noticed that the &lt;element&gt; for Extension.url was missing in the example. It is safe to represent this as a fixedURI which in all cases should reference the StructureDefinition that define the extension?<br>\nEx:  &lt;element&gt;<br>\n      &lt;path value=\"Extension.url\"&gt;<br>\n        &lt;min value=\"1\"/&gt;<br>\n        &lt;max value=\"1\"/&gt;<br>\n        &lt;fixedUri value=\"http://www.testing.com/StructureDefinition/name-qualifier\"/&gt;<br>\n      &lt;/element&gt;<br>\nHere fixedUri is the same as the Uri for the StructureDefinition that is defining this extension</p>\n<p>2. On the notion of context can <br>\n  &lt;context value=\"HumanName.given\" /&gt;<br>\n  &lt;context value=\"HumanName.prefix\" /&gt;<br>\n  &lt;context value=\"HumanName.family\" /&gt;<br>\n  &lt;context value=\"HumanName.suffix\" /&gt;</p>\n<p>be replaced by just &lt;context value=\"This extension can be used anywhere a HumanName.part appears\" /&gt;</p>",

So the value of the url should be a path to the base/core StructureDefinition of the resource/datatype in context?</p>\n<p>Also thinking about the example 2.5.2.1.2 which is different from the one above, it too is missing a url value. it goes directly into creating a valueUri which is extremely confusing <em>eyes spinning</em>. Can you please clarify and advise?</p>",
