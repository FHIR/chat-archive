If you're not asserting meaning, but just saying \"put mine first\", that's conformant, but it's a <strong>very</strong> bad practice - because you're essentially saying \"please create a custom interface for me (with all the attendant development, testing and ongoing maintenance costs) so that I can avoid the cost of of writing code once that searches through the list to find the coding I need\".
