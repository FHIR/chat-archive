I need to load a external answerlist to a questionnaire item of type choice. The answerlist is coming from a database and is unfortunately dynamic. This url unfortunately leads to nothing. Is there an alternative to the \"questionnaire-externallydefined\" or a different way i can look into?</p>",

Do not use that, and sorry for the confusion that causes.  I think you probably want to use either answerValueSet or answerExpression (which might pull from a \"variable\" extension that did a FHIR query).  You will probably need some intermediate API to transform your database output into FHIR (perhaps a ValueSet expansion).</p>",
