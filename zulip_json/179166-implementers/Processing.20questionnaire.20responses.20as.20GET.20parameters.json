        "content": "<p>Hello,<br>\nWe would like to elaborate interoperability specifications for a vaccination recommendation system, taking as input various parameters (such as patient’s clinical context) and producing as output a vaccination recommendation (FHIR document). If the initial interrogation parameters are insufficient/incomplete, the server should generate a questionnaire (using the resource Questionnaire) to be filled by the user in order to collect the missing interrogation parameters. The submission of the completed questionnaire should generate a new GET request, containing the initial interrogation parameters used along with the new ones (that are the responses to the questionnaire).<br>\nMy question: how can the server map the questionnaire responses to GET interrogation parameters, and how can these interrogation parameters be mapped to resources’ attributes so the server generates the needed vaccination recommendation?  <br>\nMany thanks in advance for any information you can give me concerning this.</p>",
