If I implement US Core as organization, I do not want to support single parameter search, but need to highlight which comparators can be used in multiparameter search - how do I do it? <br>\nI would link to a search parameter definition JSON, but - not supporting a standalone search by this parameter - I can see no good way of linking the JSON from the Capability Statement...<br>\nAny ideas, solutions, please?</p>",

If I implement those for a search parameter, I publish a Search Parameter JSON with supported comparators and link to it in my search parameter definition in Capability Statement. <br>\nBut if it is only a multiparameter search where I support these comparators (I do not support a search on date as such), I no longer have the search parameter listed in my capability statement, so cannot link the JSON. Does it mean that for multiparameter searches the clients should be guessing which comparators they could use on my server and just try them out?</p>",
