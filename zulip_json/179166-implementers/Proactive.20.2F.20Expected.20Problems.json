My initial thought is that the Condition.clinicalStatus should be describing the status of the condition or health concern where the condition, itself, is a risk.  Thus, the risk is an active concern.  Again, we'll discuss on the PC call today at 5pm Eastern to see if we need to clarify or update any of the definitions (clinicalStatus definition and/or clinical status code definitions).</p>",
