If we're just searching on one type, it makes sense to just return a Bundle. However, if we're searching across multiple types, do we separate out the results of each resource type into their own Bundles and return a Bundle of Bundles? Or is it best to merge the contents of all types into one unified Bundle?</p>\n<p>My thought is to merge everything into one Bundle to spare whatever is ingesting the result from having to go through layered Bundles.</p>",
