You have control over what goes in the Reference.display for a human to look at.  If you want discrete data about the referenced thing, you <em>must</em> resolve the Reference.  There's nothing that stops you from copying discrete data from the target of the reference and adding it as extensions, but: the data copied risks being out-of-date or outright wrong if the reference target gets corrected; and few, if any, systems will support the extensions.</p>",
