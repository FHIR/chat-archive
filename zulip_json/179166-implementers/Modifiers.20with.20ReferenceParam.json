I hope i post this message in the right channel!<br>\nI'm currently building a FHIR (R4) Server, and i try to implement the following request:</p>\n<p><code>[base]/PractitionerRole?practitioner.active:not=true</code></p>\n<p>I know that active is a Token Param, and thanks to HAPI, i can use the following command :</p>\n<p><code>TokenParam tokenSubject = referenceParam.toTokenParam(myContext);</code></p>\n<p>But sadly, all the modifier part is lost : in my referenceParam, i only have a chain part (active:not), and a value part (true), so i don't have any modifiers, missing, etc..<br>\nSo when i convert it to a TokenParam, i don't have neither the modifiers, missing, etc ...</p>\n<p><strong>So here is my question</strong> : Is there a way to have a ReferenceParam that has modifiers ?<br>\nI would like to have a chain part (active), a modifier (not) and a value (true), as in a real TokenParam</p>\n<p>I hope i made myself clear! I keep in touch ;)</p>",
