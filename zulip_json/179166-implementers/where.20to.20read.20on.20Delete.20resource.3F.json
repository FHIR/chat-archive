The UI has CRUD(create, read, update, delete). I am looking for some guidance on delete. For example, assume multiple family member history is entered and  I am deleting one of the family member history of a patient, will the familymemberhistory be deleted ?. I saw something like soft delete but not sure what that means. Could you please kindly point me where I can read about this or share some thoughts on this?. thanks for your help.</p>",

However, if the server supports history, it should still be possible to look at old versions of the resource (if you happen to know the resource id).  Even if history isn't supported, systems might still retain the record for audit purposes.  They just wouldn't return it in queries any longer.</p>",

So, if I issue a REST delete of the resource, it will not be available in search results. Can you please kindly elaborate a bit more about what change is done to the resource so it does not appear in search results ?. So, this is basically you call it as \"Soft delete\" ?.  thanks again</p>",

In fact, it's possible to 'undelete' a deleted record by submitting a PUT (update) with the id of the deleted record.  All actions - including deletes - will show up in a history of the resource.</p>",
