An example is Clinical Pipe (a product of Protocol First) that builds on SMART-on-FHIR (I believe).  In Research Systems the primary exchange model is the CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM) - but that is an just a transport model with a schema for the common containers (visits, forms, fields).  You could ask a question across in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"135\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/135-research\">#research</a>.  Medidata, Oracle, Protocol First, ClinicalInk and Nexttrials have all participated in Connectathons.  There was a presentation from the Amsterdam DevDay from Castor EDC.  </p>\n<p>I think there's a lot of interest, as eSource has been made a priority by the FDA, and other approaches (RFD, etc) never really took hold.<br>\n(STATEMENT OF INTERESTS: I work for Medidata)</p>",
