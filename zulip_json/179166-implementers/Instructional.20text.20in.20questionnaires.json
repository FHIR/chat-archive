Often the option in a standardized value set does not match the form PDF and an instructional text with the form text is then used.  This text can vary between forms and a value set only allows for only 1 display text.   Also, sometimes there are form instructions stating that a particular option is only valid when a form is being submitted during a particular time period post therapy or that if an option is selected another form needs to be completed.  What is the best way to capture that type of information?</p>",

The other possibility is to define an extension for the \"option\" element.  If you wish, you can submit a change request for HL7 to consider defining it as a standard extension.</p>",
