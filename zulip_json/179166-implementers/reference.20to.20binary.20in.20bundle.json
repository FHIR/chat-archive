I just implemented binary resource of pdf and realized that server does not accept reference from observation to binary. If I understood correctly: \"Invalid reference found at path 'Bundle.entry.resource.related.target'. Resource type 'Binary' is not valid for this path\".  I'm using: <a href=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseDstu3/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseDstu3/\">http://hapi.fhir.org/baseDstu3/</a> for testing my code. I'm able to post binary alone and inside bundle if I delete the reference to it.  So my question is why I can't have reference from observation to binary? Did I completely misunderstood something? Thanks!</p>",

So your \"related.target\" would point to another Observation which would have a value of the Binary.  Or perhaps the Binary would be the value of your current Observation or one of its components - if the Binary were something that was not interpretable except as part of the overall observation.</p>",
