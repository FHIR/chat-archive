We were testing for sort order by comparing the version IDs of the returned resources, even if they were different resources--so if Resource A had a version ID of 2, and was updated after Resource B which had a version ID of 1, we would consider that a failure. I updated the test to only check sort order by the last updated time, which seems more rational, and has fixed the test on the server you posted.</p>",
