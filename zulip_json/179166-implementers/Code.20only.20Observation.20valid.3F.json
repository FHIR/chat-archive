The pattern works well for most situations and makes sense to me, but is a real pain for the type of things you would find in an unstructured note.  <br>\nLike you wouldn't see 'status of vomiting symptom (observable)': 'patient has vomited (finding)'.  Just 'vomiting'. So to programmatically extract a FHIR resource from that text you would have to know that 'vomiting' interprets 'status of vomiting'. At least in this case you have the concept \"405166007 | Nausea and vomiting status (observable entity) |\"</p>\n<p>I suppose I'm  just voicing frustration after spending like 4 hours trying to find the question 'Is the tumor surgically resectable'. I'm not even sure how to phrase the question if I look to add it, or if it should be a clinical impression.</p>",

It would let you segment it the locationQualifiers into slices like laterality, lobe, segment, anatomical third (distal/proximal having a little relevance for Stage IA NSCL). I haven't actually made the profile yet that we intend to use to represent a lung nodule or tumor,  so this is a tentative plan. But yeah, definitely more work and would depend on what you intend to do with the data I suppose. I just thought I'd point you to it because it was just altered in the last week or two to better capture tumors/nodules.</p>",
