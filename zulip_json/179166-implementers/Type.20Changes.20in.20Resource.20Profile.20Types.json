The change is the conversion from <code>structuredefinition-&lt;lang&gt;-type</code> to <code>structuredefinition-fhir-type</code>, which also included moving the field from <code>type._code.extension</code> to <code>type.extension</code>.</p>\n<p>Overall the new method is much cleaner (yay!), but I was surprised by a bunch of odd behaviors in my tooling when it couldn't find the JSON types anymore.</p>\n<p>My searching may not be up to scratch, but I can't find info on here or GForge, so figured I would ask.  (Tagging <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> because this probably could've just been a PM to you : ).</p>",
