In particular I'm trying to represent a Chaperone and an Advocate (which I'm assuming will be a RelatedPerson). In the DSTU2 appointment, the participant types are tied down to the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/encounter-participant-type\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/encounter-participant-type\">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/encounter-participant-type</a> list (i.e. required), which doesn't support detail. Even this list in RelatedPerson.relationship (which isn't the correct place to model this data!) is tied down to the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/relatedperson-relationshiptype\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/relatedperson-relationshiptype\">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/relatedperson-relationshiptype</a>, which mostly covers blood and non-blood relatives, but not chaperone or advocate. Has anyone else encountered this problem in DSTU2, and if so what was the solution. I know that STU3 has made the Appointment.paticipant.type extensible, but this is a project in DSTU2.</p>",

Unfortunately in DSTU2, your only way around the brokenness of it being 'required' is to use an extension and omit type.</p>",
