For example, when a patient is assigned to a PCP <strong>at a specific organization</strong>, it feels like the Patient.generalPractitioner (and/or CareTeam.participant.member) might need to reference PractitionerRole.  I saw in PA meeting minutes there might have been a similar discussion on ReferralRequest needing to know the practitioner at a specific org as well.  </p>\n<p>Also, if Practitioner.role is replaced with a reference to PractitionerRole, then doesn't that create a circular reference? </p>",
