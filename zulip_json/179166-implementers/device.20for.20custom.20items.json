Triggered by a tracker from Lloyd.   I'm thinking these could be profiles on device.    This ties into ordering and the various request resources.   For example EyeglassPresciption would go away and you would use DeviceUseRequest and reference the eyeglasses profile.   The Other thought is create resources for the \"common\" stuff like eyeglasses/contacts, hearing aids, teeth, limbs.      </p>",

Creating separate resources for each doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  While the basic optical characteristics for vision prescriptions haven't changed much over the years, there are some new things (contacts rather than glasses, tinting, etc.) and there'll likely be more new things in the future.  Having a generic structure makes more sense to me.</p>",
