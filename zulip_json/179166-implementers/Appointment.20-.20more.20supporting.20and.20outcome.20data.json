Appointment outcome - we also have few followup documentation once the appointment is completed.<br>\nbelow are few sample data,</p>\n<p>We were thinking to map these information in Appointment.supportingInfo</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span> 1. Candidate for Permanent Access Surgery\n 2. Vessel Mapping Completed at this appointment\n 3.  Additional Consult Needed\n 4. Follow up  Medical Clearance needed\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Would it make sense to put the above data in DiagnosticReport/Observation (each element is an observation) or QuestionnaireResponse?</p>\n<p>Appointment.supportingInfo --&gt; DiagnosticReport --&gt; Observation<br>\nAppointment.supportingInfo --&gt; QuestionnareResponse</p>\n<p>Please advice.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nVijay</p>",
