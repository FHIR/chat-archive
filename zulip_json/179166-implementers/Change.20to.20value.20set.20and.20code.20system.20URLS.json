Many URLs are changing to be based on <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://terminology.hl7.org\">http://terminology.hl7.org</a> instead of <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir\">hl7.org/fhir</a>). The v2 and v3 content has already changed in the draft at <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org\">build.fhir.org</a>, and I will be migrating any value set or code system where the system URL appears in instances (e.g. Coding/CodeableConcept bindings) to <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://terminology.hl7.org\">terminology.hl7.org</a> as well.</p>",

In terms of a sweeping change, was the change to <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://terminology.hl7.org\">http://terminology.hl7.org</a> going to apply across all CodeSystem and ValueSet URLs in use by R4 resources? I've noticed in AllergyIntolerance that some ValueSets refer to CodeSystems hosted at <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://terminology.hl7.org\">http://terminology.hl7.org</a> while others refer to CodeSystems at <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/\">http://hl7.org/fhir/</a>, so some explanation of the approach taken will help us plan locally.</p>",
