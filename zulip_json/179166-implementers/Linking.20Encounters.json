The intended use is to capture sequences of related encounters where there is not necessarily a parent episode that keeps them together. </p>\n<p>Suggestion 2<br>\nAdd an additional element (extensible coding?) to the standard extension mentioned above to give the referenced encounter context. The A&amp;E encounter above has two references, you would want to know why they are linked. Each reference type may come with additional business rules etc. </p>\n<p>Suggestion 2 would solve our requirements, but I think both suggestions are probably good. 1 would make it clearer, and is also an option to use instead of/or in addition to partOf.</p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>",

EposodeOfCare vand Encounter with partOf takes care of most of the encounter hierarchies that we've discussing in the past.

But I would also see the Hospital Provider Spell as an Encounter, as the partOf references another Encounter. </p>\n<p>The EpisodeOfCare should be something that is on a higher level than an individual encounter, and can span over individual encounters. There can also be gaps between encounters in an episode of care. I think this description explains it in a good way (from EpisodeOfCare):</p>\n<p>EpisodeOfCare: Case, Program, Problem, Episode<br>\nEncounter: Visit, Contact </p>\n<p>The HPS I guess is rather often mapped 1:1 to a Consultant Episode as often transfer of specialty/consultant isnt required. </p>\n<p>I'm not sure what you mean with \"ADT's and care encounters\"? I would see it as:<br>\n- Patient is admitted--&gt;Hospital Provider Spell starts AND first Consultant Episode starts=Encounter A + Encounter B (partOf A)<br>\n- Transfer of Consultant responsibility--&gt;HPS unchanged, previous CE ends, a new CE starts=Encounter A+Encounter B (partOf A)+Encounter C (partOf A) .<br>\n-Patient is discharged--&gt;HPS ends, last CE ends =Encounter A+Encounter B (partOf A)+Encounter C (partOf A)</p>",
