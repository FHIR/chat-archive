However, I've noticed that it currently only supports Medication, Substance, and Device resources.  What if we want to track something that isn't one of those three things, such as Disposables?  Needles, bandages, tongue depressors, etc?  Would these just be devices?  Or would I be better just using a generic resource like Basic?  </p>",
