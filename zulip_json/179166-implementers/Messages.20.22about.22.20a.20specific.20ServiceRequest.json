Messaging events include things like submit-referral, add-appointment, update-status, send-communication, etc…</p>\n<p>Most events include only the messageHeader + the main resource of the event (like appointment or task). </p>\n<p>Every message is “about” a specific referral (ServiceRequest). However, not every message includes the ServiceRequest resource in it. We are trying to determine an easy way to identify which referral each message is “about” without traversing deep into the multiple resource calls, or adding additional resources (i.e., serviceRequest) into each payload.</p>\n<p>The current idea is, the sending system will submit its own native identifier with the initial ServiceRequest, then every subsequent message with include that identifier in the messageHeader, no matter the event. MessageHeader does not have an identifier, so we would need to add an identifier element.</p>\n<p>Is this an appropriate workflow to tie messages to a specific ServiceRequest? Is there another method we should consider?</p>",
