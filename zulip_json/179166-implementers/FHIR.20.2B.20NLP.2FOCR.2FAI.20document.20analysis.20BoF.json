Just in general - I’m curious if NLP-based decomposition of a document into FHIR resources is the right way to go as a first pass. I’d like to get the group thoughts on generic _text searches. My concern (which I hope I’m just missing something) is that it gets progressively more difficult to pick the proper FHIR resources from NLP when we start talking about things like MedicationRequest, MedicationAdminstration etc.</p>",
