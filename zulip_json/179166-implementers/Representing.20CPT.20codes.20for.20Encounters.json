There is a tension in the QI-Core mapping between the way things are done now with quality measures, and the way we'd like to do them that aligns better with how data is actually stored in systems. We talked quite a bit about whether to use \"class\" or \"type\" in Encounter, but settled on \"class\" because it's more conceptually correct. However, it may be the \"type\" is more practical?</p>",

Again, namely that \"class\" has a preferred binding to ActEncounterCodes and only supports a cardinality of 0...1. The \"type\" attribute is defined more flexibly to allow implementers to codify encounters as required by the use case (in this case, the quality value sets).</p>",
