By secondary claim I mean a claim which was already adjudicated by primary payer and now we have to bill to secondary payer by COB including all adjudication data from primary payer.</p>",

The communication may occur via phone call where an agent will 'open a file' and then provide a pre-assigned number to be used. Note that this is a different concept from a pre-authorization reference number (also possibly provided by phone)</p>",

If the provider always handles COB then they can issue claim IDs (or use the one(s) given to them) as needed as the claim proceeds down the COB path. However, if the payor handles COB either by adjudication for each of the plans they process (e.g. Blue on Blue) or by exchange with the other plan adjudicators, then the responses to all but the first claim are to claims whose ID are not known. Therefore this provides a mechanism for the provider to provide the claim numbers for all potential claims upfront so that all answers have identifiable questions.</p>",
