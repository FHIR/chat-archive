I've been reviewing this page: <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/languages.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/languages.html</a></p>\n<p>Based on what I see here, it looks like the actual query syntax should always be in english. This means that GET [your-fhir-server]/Patient?_elements=identifier,active works but GET [your-fhir-server]/Brevet?Éléments=identificateur,actif would not. <strong>Is that the correct interpretation</strong>?</p>\n<p>However, FHIR is setup to support returning resources that are in a different language and you can use the translation extensions and other pieces referenced in the page above to ensure that the end user gets data in the language they are expecting. </p>\n<p>Does that seem right?</p>",
