        "content": "<p>Hopefully a quick and easy question/answer. We are looking at transforming STU3 profiles into R4 profiles. Most of the mappings are provided on the R4 resources on the \"R3 Conversions\" tab. It looks like there's a general format to the syntax in that elements that are on the base resouce and not in a backbone element are addressed directly (for example src.identifier -&gt; tgt.identifier;) those in a backbone element are put into their own group and dealt with. I'm a bit unsure as to what to do with extensions. For example, is the source (STU3 profile) has a complex extension that part of now belongs on a R4 element - what's the mapping language syntax? For example, within a STU3 MedicationRequest we have a complex extension that has information about repeat medication<br>\nExtension url:https:[base]/StructureDefinition/Extension-MedicationRepeatInformation<br>\n  extension url: numberOfRepeatPrescriptionsAllowed (as an integer)<br>\n  extension url: numberOfRepeatPrescriptionsIssued (as an integer)<br>\nThe numberOfRepeatPrescriptionsAllowed now maps to the R4 element MedicationRequest.dispenseRequest.numberOfRepeatsAllowed<br>\nHow would we represent this in FHIR mapping language? - in terms of how do you reference an element in a complex extension?</p>",
