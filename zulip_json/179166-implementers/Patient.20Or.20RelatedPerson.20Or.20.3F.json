Once the Baby is born, that registered representative can access the record. I was thinking of using RelatedPerson along with Consent. But I can't use RelatedPerson coz it has a mandatory Patient reference. Since the baby hasn't born during the registration, I don't have a Patient reference created. <br>\nIs this advisable to register that person (representative) as 'Administrative' Patient? please note this person (representative) may or not have have a health record at all. Suggestion ?</p>",

I was also thinking of an alternative solution to create a RelatedPerson for the representative with 'to be born' baby Patient as a 'contained' resource. This Patient will not have any details (may be only a name 'fetus of $mother') In that way the context of the 'to be born' baby Patient will be bounded with the RelatedPerson I believe. Once the Baby is born, then we will Create a Patient instance/s and remove the Contained reference.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191367\">@Brian Postlethwaite</span> , is there a possibility to make patient reference as optional in RelatedPerson in future releases to ensure that the RelatedPerson can exist even before the Patient context has been created. </p>\n<p>thanks <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191404\">@John Moehrke</span> , yes in my model I'm using Consent for this purpose. I'm planning to use 'Consent.patient' refer to the baby once born (in this case). Consent.provision.actor.reference to refer to the RelatedPerson who has consented. Basically the RelatedPerson.  Consent.provision.actor.role to define the role of the RelatedPerson in this context and Consent.provision.type to check if the consent is in operating state.</p>",
