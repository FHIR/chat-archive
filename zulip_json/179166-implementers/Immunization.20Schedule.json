BTW... I'm surmising that you are taking <em>immunization</em> to mean \"the act of administering a vaccine\" and <em>immunity</em> to mean \"the state of being protected against a vaccine-preventable disease\". Is this terminology the accepted practice? (sorry... it makes sense of course... it's just that I've not heard the terms employed that way). And... just because I jabbed a baby and made them cry doesn't necessarily mean I actually made progress towards immunity. The timing of the medication administration is <strong><em>very important</em></strong>. Not adhering to the timing (incorrect spacing between the 3 doses) and the immunity <strong>is not</strong> achieved.</p>",

There is an idea of a \"path to immunity\", where each dose (whether combo or not) can lead you towards the goal of immunity. Of course, we don't know if the immunization resulted in immunity for a specific patient but we can indicate that the patient followed the timing and spacing intervals correctly and so is assumed to be immunized.</p>",
