However, lack of access permissions, temporary database issues, flaky network, server migrations, etc. might all mean that a link won't resolve.  Think of references like hyperlinks on a webpage.  Ideally, they'll resolve, but the world isn't always ideal.</p>\n<p>Also, within a Bundle, sometimes links will refer to content within the Bundle and sometimes they'll refer to something outside the Bundle.  urn:uuid must always resolve within the Bundle.  However, resources with an http/https might resolve within the Bundle or RESTfully.</p>",
