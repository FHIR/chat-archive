        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191336\">@Michel Rutten</span> ,<br>\nI can’t say if this is a bug but this new version of forge (Forge 18.6) is doing things which I would like to get to your notice. <br>\nI was doing a non-normative change which is just updating structuredefinition.title of a related person profile and expected GIT to detect only this particular change but many changes which I haven’t done have showed up like &lt;element id=\"RelatedPerson.identifier:healthcarecard.system\"&gt; changed to  &lt;element id=\"RelatedPerson.identifier:healthcareCard.system\"&gt;. The change here is the case of ‘C’ in healthcarecard. <br>\nSo out of my curiosity I have started looking into other profiles as well. I found that if we just open and close the profile in forge doesn’t do anything but a small non-normative change like the one mentioned above is triggering it. I have attached a screenshot for you reference and would like to request to shed some light over this behaviour. <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/iUOn126Fqx5tBfooMsb2n4Ub/Forge-18.6-Case-problem.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Forge-18.6-Case-problem.png\">Forge-18.6-Case-problem.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/iUOn126Fqx5tBfooMsb2n4Ub/Forge-18.6-Case-problem.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Forge-18.6-Case-problem.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/iUOn126Fqx5tBfooMsb2n4Ub/Forge-18.6-Case-problem.png\"></a></div>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192201\">@Satya Yelisetti</span>, correct, Forge has some special logic to support element ids. After some discussion with FHIR core team, we decided that it would be best for Forge to auto-generate element id values according to a predefined \"canonical\" format. The element id values are generated from element paths and slice names (if specified). Changing any (!) element property triggers Forge to re-generate the associated element id and the ids of all child elements.<br>\nIn this case, it looks like the casing of the slice name was updated externally. As a result, the (previously generated) element id's were no longer in sync. Editing the profile caused Forge to re-synchronize the element id's from the actual, updated slicename.</p>",

The popular reference tools all implement the default format. Most importantly, you have to ensure that element references are kept in sync with the actual element ids.
