Then doctor will check up the PatientA in HospitalB and will store the Observation resource regarding check up in FhirServerB.</p>\n<p>Kindly correct me maybe I am wrong somewhere</p>",

Their classic set of PIX/PDQ/XDS/XCA have been cast into FHIR and come out as PIXm/PDQm/MHD... etc. The question you ask is more of an operational question, which the standards and profiles can only define as far as giving support, where the operational environment must make decisions on the way they will implement. Some may choose to centralize a MPI, some may choose to federate, some may choose to dynamically discover.</p>",
