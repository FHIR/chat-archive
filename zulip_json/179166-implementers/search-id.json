Thus, on our part we can find what the search request &amp; response were and who was our fedrated partner, while on the partner's side, they would be able to track this further to find who the user was, what she/he was doing, etc. An equivalent of your server's search-id would work for us if we either get it from the consumers as a search parameter or generate it on our end and return to the partner system with the search response. I just wanted to confirm that this doesn't break any FHIR rules (based on the fact that your server returns search-id, I assume it's fine with FHIR).</p>",
