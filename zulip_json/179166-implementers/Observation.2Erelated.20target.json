The rationale is as follows:\n- it creates more complex instances\n- it requires slicing to apply constraints to what relationships are supported, what cardinalities are allowed, which resource types are permitted, etc.\n- it creates the possibility of ambiguity as to what&#39;s in core.  Relationships that aren&#39;t part of core shouldn&#39;t be included as part of core whether explicit relationships or the code+reference approach is used\ncode + reference is appropriate if the number of &quot;core&quot; relationship types is large (&gt;~5) and the referenced type choices make sense for all of the relationship types.
