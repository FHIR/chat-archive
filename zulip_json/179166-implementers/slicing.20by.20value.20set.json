I'm also confused as to why this would not be solved by using two codeableConcepts in the Race Extension wherein one is bound to a value set with only the 5 blessed codes and the other is bound to a value set with all the codes (you might want to make that value set less the blessed 5). You can use terminology service to detemine which granular code rolled up to the blessed 5. This approach is actually doirectly consistent with how C-CDA is doing it and is the way most consistent with the US race coding expectation as defined in the ONC ISA. It is important to note that in the USA you can have multiple race codes but must report one blessed 5 so the approach I've noted makes that easy.</p>\n<p>That said, if you want to pack everything into one CodeableConcept then I don't see an advantage to this and you have a MAJOR disadvantage in that you can not properly capture multiple different race codes because use of the translation demands that the translation be another concept meant to represent the main concept provided so you would not be able to use that to communicate multiple different races.</p>",
