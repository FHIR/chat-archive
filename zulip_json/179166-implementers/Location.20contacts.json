For example one organization may manage multiple locations and the organization contact may not be appropriate for each Location.

If you're interested in contacts with specific roles, then you probably want the Organization that's tied 1..1 with the Location.  Locations have no responsibilities - they're just physical places.  As soon as you start talking about responsibility, you're into Organizational space.  You can have an Organization at the \"per location\" level even if it's not a distinct legal entity.</p>",
