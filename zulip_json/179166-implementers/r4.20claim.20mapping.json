Also another related question - is it true that semantics of .responsible in careTeam has changed since dstu3? Description says \"Indicator of the lead practitioner\" which is much more vague then \"Billing provider\" in dstu 3 spec <span aria-label=\"slight smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"slight smile\">:slight_smile:</span>. I think right now .responsible means supervising provider on site rather than billing provider. Thanks!</p>",
