Kind of like searching for a hair-dresser, but only some will do a perm.</p>\n<p>I'm currently considering the following alternatives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a \"Service options\" extension</li>\n<li>Use \"HealthcareService.Characteristics\"</li>\n<li>Use Healthcareservice.type (which is already being used for the main taxonomy classification like \"orthopaedic specialist\", \"physiotherapist\", \"meals on wheels\".</li>\n<li>Use Healthcareservice.specialty, (throwing the preferred valueset out the window.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>",
