But it is also generic in a sense that you can initialize it with a set of structure definitions and it then supports that resources defined in the structure definitions. It will even work with custom structure definitions as long as the basic primitive types are the same. I could even allow the upload of new structure definitions during runtime. What I currently don't support are search parameters. The capability statement is generated from known structure definitions.</p>",
