I wan't to get as close to your 'inclusion criteria's'/ authorization model as possible in my test bed. Could you say if it is roughly based on the defined CompartmentDefinitions (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/compartmentdefinition.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/compartmentdefinition.html</a>) or alike. I haven't been able to find it described on eg. <a href=\"https://fhir.epic.com/Documentation?docId=patientfacingfhirapps\">https://fhir.epic.com/Documentation?docId=patientfacingfhirapps</a></p>",
