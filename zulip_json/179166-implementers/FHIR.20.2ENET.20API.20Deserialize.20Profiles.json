I was tasked with writing a JSON-Deserializer for the types defined on <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/evo/evoprkhbabundle\">https://simplifier.net/evo/evoprkhbabundle</a> and <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/evo/evoprkhbacomposition\">https://simplifier.net/evo/evoprkhbacomposition</a>. It would be great to get some info on how to proceed in this case, especially if it is possible to define custom C#-Classes f√ºr the types and to deserialize to these directly. Or is the preferred way to deserialize to a predefined type like Composition and Bundle? Or using the low-level types?<br>\nAlso, it would be great to have some info about how to define the changes on the profiles mentioned above in the C#-Class, if that is supported.</p>\n<p>Kind regards,<br>\nAshwani Mehlem</p>",

Your deserialiser doesn't know which profile to read it as. It's better to think around generating facades to access the underlying resources for building and reading</p>",
