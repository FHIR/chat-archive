As Ted said, we are actively working out how to handle NDC, including the \"official\" 10-digit (with dashes) codes and the 11-digit codes that are required for e-prescribing, etc.  I'm finishing up with an example of a solution for that, which we should be discussing (and hopefully approving) on the Vocab wG Main call in 2 weeks (8/20).  I'm not sure, though, if FHIR build terminology server (<a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a>) or HL7 terminology (<a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org\">terminology.hl7.org</a>) support is critical for your use case?  There may be ways to work around that until support is available (I will mention that the HL7 infrastructure will probably never support NDC fully with the nearly \"real time\", or even monthly, updates).  I'm sure we can work out reasonable solution(s), whatever they need to be.</p>",
