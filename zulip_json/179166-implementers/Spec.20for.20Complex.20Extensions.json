All I can find is the example here: <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility-examples.html#complex\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility-examples.html#complex\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility-examples.html#complex</a> .  Specifically, the example in that section doesn't have ids, but curling the StructureDefinition for that extension (patient-clinicaltrial) has ids that identify which sub-extensions slice fields belong to, e.g., Extension.extension:nct.valueString.  This is fairly significant, because it's the _only_ way I can tell (other than ordering) to tell which slice the subfield belongs to.</p>",
