I noticed that the status of these extensions is “Draft”. Could this be a reason why this is happening? <br>\nAny advice on how to resolve this is appreciated.

Specifically, Forge tries to resolve all dependencies from the same folder structure as the referencing profile. I suggest that you download all the referenced extension definitions and save them to the same target folder as the referencing profile. Now, if you load your profile,  Forge should automatically resolve all extensions.</p>",
