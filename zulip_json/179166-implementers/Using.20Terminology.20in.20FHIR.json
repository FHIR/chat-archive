Or better still a link to a video to benefit those, like myself that are unable to attend?    There are some areas of using terminology in FHIR that I am uncertain of, hence my interest in this tutorial.  Apologies in advance if this is not the appropriate \"stream\" to post this query on, but it seems to be one of the most active, hence I am posting this here.</p>",
