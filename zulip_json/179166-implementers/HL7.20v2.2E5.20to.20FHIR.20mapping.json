        "content": "<p>Hello, hope this is the correct place to ask. Are there any resources that describe the mapping of HL7 2.5 fields to FHIR resources? We have an application with a fairly extensive 2.5 implementation, but for some projects FHIR is required, and we're unsure about how to correctly translate 2.5 messages to FHIR messages. We can make guesses on how to map eg. statusses, but if there is an official resource about that we'd rather make sure to follow the standard.</p>",

We've started mapping a few basic message types (ADT, ORM, ORU, VXU) but are actively looking for feedback and input. It hasn't been officially balloted yet but is heading in that direction. The mappings use v2.8.2 as a basis but should be compatible with v2.5. We meet every week on both Monday and Tuesday if you'd like to join the calls. There is also a Zulip stream dedicated to the topic at <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179188-v2-to.20FHIR\" title=\"#narrow/stream/179188-v2-to.20FHIR\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179188-v2-to.20FHIR</a></p>",
