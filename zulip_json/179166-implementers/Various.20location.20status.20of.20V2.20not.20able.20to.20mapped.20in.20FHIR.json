Or may be FHIR is built differently, there are trigger events but not used heavily in FHIR. then with simple resources or transactions, how to convey the same information conveyed by A02. Or the way is that new FHIR Location resource will have new location and receiver will always take it as updated information regarding location. So need of explicit trigger. Each resource come at a point in time contains new data and take it and compare it while updating resource data in your system, is that the way? Seems so, but looking for expert comments. But still in this approach also, no way to say which was prior location or what is temporary location? </p>",
