The dosageInstruction contains text, so there is a textual representation per dosageInstruction. This was also the case in V3.</p>\n<p>In The Netherlands we experienced, already in our V3-implementations, that vendors seldomly support a textual representation per dosage instruction, but always support one textual representation per medication request (because concatenating individual instructions is simpler than the other way around). In our V3-implementation guide this resulted in a description for organizations receiving a V3-message: \"if the texts in the different medicationAdministrationRequest's are identical, then make a distinct selection, otherwise concatenate all texts in the correct order\". Ouch.</p>\n<p>A comprehensive text is also what is usually needed on the label on the product itself (which is dispensed to the patient) and in the communication with patients / administrators and other partners in the medication process. </p>\n<p>The Dutch datamodel therefore defines a textual representation on MedicationRequest level and not on dosageInstruction level.</p>\n<p>What are the experiences in other countries?</p>",
