I fixed the issue that caused the initial failures, but now I never get a build notification for my IG (whether triggering via a push or manually) -- and the build.log hasn't changed (it is still that last failed build).</p>\n<p>I think my build is getting hung or timing out. Is there any way to get more insight into the build process as it is happening? As it is now, it's very difficult to determine what's going on -- as the build succeeds locally (albeit with reported errors in qa.html), but seems to get lost in the auto-build.</p>\n<p>This is for the IG at <a href=\"https://github.com/HL7/us-breastcancer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/HL7/us-breastcancer\">https://github.com/HL7/us-breastcancer</a>.</p>",
