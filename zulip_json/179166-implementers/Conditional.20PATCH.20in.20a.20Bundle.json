This works for me, however when I make the patch conditional, it fails with the error \"Resource MeasureReport is not known\". </p>\n<p>Example:<br>\n  {<br>\n    request: {<br>\n      method: 'PATCH',<br>\n      url: 'MeasureReport?subject=Patient/d86da58e-fada-4324-af45-909f56be55cb&amp;measure=Measure/Day-Insight&amp;date=eq2020-09-16T00:00:00'<br>\n    },<br>\n    resource: {<br>\n      resourceType: 'Binary',<br>\n      contentType: 'application/json-patch+json',<br>\n      data: 'W3sib3AiOiAicmVwbGFjZSIsInBhdGgiOiAiL3N0YXR1cyIsInZhbHVlIjogImVycm9yIn1d'<br>\n    }<br>\n  }</p>\n<p>I've also tried this with resource type Observation.<br>\nIs this happening because the resource type is Binary, but the url is pointing to type MeasureReport? If so, how do I enable conditional patching within a bundle?</p>",
