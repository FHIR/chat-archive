However, when I use the <code>innetwork</code> code, the validator tool fails with the following error: </p>\n<p>\"None of the codings provided are in the value set <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/ValueSet/C4BBAdjudicationCategoryDiscriminator\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/ValueSet/C4BBAdjudicationCategoryDiscriminator</a> (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/ValueSet/C4BBAdjudicationCategoryDiscriminator\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/ValueSet/C4BBAdjudicationCategoryDiscriminator</a>), and a coding from this value set is required) (codes = <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/ValueSet/C4BBPayerBenefitPaymentStatus#innetwork\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/ValueSet/C4BBPayerBenefitPaymentStatus#innetwork</a>)\"</p>\n<p>Indeed, when I inspect the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/ValueSet/C4BBAdjudicationCategoryDiscriminator\">C4BBAdjudicationCategoryDiscriminator</a> value set (version 1.0.0) the <code>innetwork</code> and <code>outofnetwork</code> codes are missing BUT they are present in the 1.1.0 version of the same document which makes me wonder if this is a bug with the 1.0 IG which was fixed in 1.1 and there's nothing I can do to make the validator work for this slice.</p>\n<p>Has someone seen this before? Is there any way to get rid of this error?</p>",

Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done to get a 1.0 instance to pass validators for the Professional &amp; Non clinician EoB except to not include EoB.item. Otherwise you will have to move to 1.1. <br>\n(The ticket for reference: <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32285\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32285</a>)</p>",
