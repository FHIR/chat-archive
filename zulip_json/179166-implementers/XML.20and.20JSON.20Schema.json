It's slightly less useless for JSON schema, but the current state of JSON schema validators doesn't really make it worth the effort.  In all cases, you don't want to use schema for code generation and they're pretty poor at validation compared to the hand-coded validators (which understand terminology bindings, FHIRPath invariants, slicing and a bunch of other important things that neither of the schema languages can handle.</p>",
