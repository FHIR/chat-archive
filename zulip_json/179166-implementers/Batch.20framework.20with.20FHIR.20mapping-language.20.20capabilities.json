My particular case is to find all the Contract resources which will expire today and set their Contract.status to \"terminated\". In order to achive the reusability my idea is to create a few separate micro-applications and then connect them trough the Spring DataFlow framework (which is some kind of EIP framework). The first application will search in FHIR Server by externally specified parameters. The result will be routed to the FHIR mapping-language aware micro-application which in turn will set the value of the Contract status. My question is whether this approch for data transformation is applicable for such kind of activity. This can be achived also by using for example XSLT. Is there any other data processing and automation framework specifically bound to FHIR which can be used for simmillar activities.</p>",
