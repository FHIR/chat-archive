If a resource exists as a stand-alone resource, conveying it as a contained resource would be inappropriate.  Containment is intended for use in situations where you have a little bit of information about a target resource, but not enough for it to exist independently.  E.g. a provider where you've got a name and type but not an identifier; a medication where you have a name but not a code, etc.</p>",
