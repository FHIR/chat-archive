It looks like it's sandbox only, so trying to understand when it might go into production.</p>",

I think just one or two of them are using it in an actual production setting and the others are still in test/pilot.  I'm happy to answer any specific questions (my role is basically FHIR oversight) and/or I can connect you with the DPC team if you want to have more in-depth conversations, get together in person, attend our office-hours, etc.  Sounds like you've already checked out our sandbox/docs.  There's also a Google Group if you're interested.  <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/DPC-API\">https://groups.google.com/g/DPC-API</a></p>",
