In particular, a recommendation not to perform a screening would be a ServiceRequest with doNotPerform true (CPG profile for this is here: <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-recommendations/StructureDefinition-cpg-servicerequest.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-recommendations/StructureDefinition-cpg-servicerequest.html</a>)<br>\n2) useContext is about establishing structurally represented criteria like gender, age-range, target setting, or related condition. Subject is specifically establishing the \"scope\" for the recommendation (i.e. does this recommendation apply to (and get evaluated in the context of) a patient, or a location, or an organization?). So women aged 21 to 29 years is a subject of Patient and useContext of gender and age range.<br>\n3) Almost all PlanDefinitions so far have been patient context. There are some measure use cases that have used other useContexts like Location and Organization. So no search path because no demand for it. Happy to add a search param if it's needed.</p>",
