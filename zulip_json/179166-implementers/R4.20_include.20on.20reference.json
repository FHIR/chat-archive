It looks like: <strong>url/RequestGroup?id=001&amp;_include=RequestGroup:basedOn</strong><br>\nThe goal is to get MedicationRequest resources, which are referenced in RequestGroup. </p>\n<p>I have some experience to build simple SP based on token, string, date, so the first attempt was to build a SearchParameter with the type:reference. Then I guess I should define elements such as target, chain, usw. in SP, but I'm not totally sure about that.  Â¿?</p>\n<p>The SP looks now:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>{\n    &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;SearchParameter&quot;,\n    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;basedOn&quot;,\n    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://cens.cl/fhir/Search/basedOn&quot;,\n    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;basedOn&quot;,\n    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;active&quot;,\n    &quot;code&quot;: &quot;basedOn&quot;,\n    &quot;base&quot;: [\n        &quot;RequestGroup&quot;\n    ],\n    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;reference&quot;,\n    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Get MedicationRequests resources&quot;,\n    &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;RequestGroup.basedOn&quot;,\n    &quot;chain&quot;: &quot;getBasedOn&quot;,\n    &quot;xpathUsage&quot;: &quot;normal&quot;,\n    &quot;target&quot;: [\n          &quot;MedicationRequest&quot;\n        ]\n}\n</pre></div>",

        "content": "<p>Looks quite allright to me. Just 'chain' is incorrect - it should be an array and can only list searchparameters that are defined on the target resourcetype (MedicationRequest in this case). But Vonk simply supports all the parameters on the target resourcetype automatically. You can try it ,the searchparameter and see whether it works with your own copy of Vonk, see the <a href=\"http://docs.simplifier.net/vonk/features/customsearchparameters.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://docs.simplifier.net/vonk/features/customsearchparameters.html\">doc</a><br>\n(PS: Others will need to help you further for the next few weeks - I'll be on holiday from now on, without Zulip)</p>",
