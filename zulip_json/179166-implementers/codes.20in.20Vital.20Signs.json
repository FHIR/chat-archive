Clearly, from the perspective of the terminology (LOINC) these are not the same thing - that's why they've defined different codes for them. But from the point of this particular context - that is, representing the test that was done - both codes are representations of the same concept : this is the test that we performed\". By saying that \"both code are representations of the same concept\" you are egregiously misusing the word \"concept\". What you mean to say is \"the meaning converyed by the entire resource is not dependent on the detailed meaning of the specific test used.\" Correct?</p>",
