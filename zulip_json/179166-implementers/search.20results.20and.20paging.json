If there is a 'first' page does that have the same information as the results contained in Bundle? I have seen servers return results with 0 entries and 0 totals but pages. In that case the 'first' page has the first results. There may be a next as well. Are both cases okay? I am just wondering how many if-then-else clauses I will have to make.</p>",
