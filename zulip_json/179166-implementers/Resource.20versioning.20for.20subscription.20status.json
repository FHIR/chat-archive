However, for subscription resource, since the subscription status (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/subscription-definitions.html#Subscription.status\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/subscription-definitions.html#Subscription.status\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/subscription-definitions.html#Subscription.status</a>) could flip between “active” and “error” thousands times, does it make sense to store all the versions? Do you think it’s reasonable to ignore the subscription resource versions caused by status change only?</p>",
