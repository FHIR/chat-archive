If I set the intent to \"order\" for all my resource instances, I am getting this error in the test tool - \"Message:<br>\nCannot find second value for intent to perform a multipleOr search\". I am guessing it is because Inferno is looking for records with more than 1 code. <br>\nThis may not be the stream to ask this question, but can you please suggest intent values for patient medication records in an ambulatory environment? In our table, we have meds that are prescribed and not dispensed; meds that are dispensed; meds that have been renewed or refilled and entered-in-error meds. Thank you!</p>",
