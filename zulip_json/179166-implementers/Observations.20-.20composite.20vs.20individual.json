I would expect that the ABP would be used for the FHIR Observation CodableConcept, and then each of the 3 as CodeableConcepts for each of the respective components.   In the pre-coordinated world of IEEE 11073 there are separate codes for each type of BP, e.g. non-specific BP, ABP, NIBP, PAP, LAP, etc.   Has the IHE done a mapping of the PCD profile to FHIR?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rtmms.nist.gov/rtmms/index.htm#!rosetta\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://rtmms.nist.gov/rtmms/index.htm#!rosetta\">https://rtmms.nist.gov/rtmms/index.htm#!rosetta</a></p>",

In my opinion, the better approach would be making it an additional component in the same Observation with systolic and diastolic values, because they are produced and interpreted together. Same for the other supplemental values, which are closely related to a single blood pressure measurement.</p>",
