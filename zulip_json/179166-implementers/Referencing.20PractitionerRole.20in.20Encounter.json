Typically only the practioner's ASV team numbers (aka identifiers) are known.</p>\n<p>So I would like to be able to represent the practitioner's actual hospital or practice where the encounter takes place as Encounter.serviceProvider and the practitioner in his context as an ASV team member as Encounter.participant.individual(PractionerRole).</p>\n<p>I'd welcome any thoughts on this before just adding a tracker to allow Encounter.participant.individual(PractionerRole).</p>",
