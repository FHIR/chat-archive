It would be much more useful (easier) if these signup ballots were organized into subgroups, e.g. FHIR, V2, V2, etc. and then have a 'check all' button that would allow you to more easily check all boxes without needing to do them one-at-a-time.  (it seems like there are over 30 ballot groups this time).   I don't know where to put this request since this is not FHIR-specific but thought the folks here would know.   Is this or can this be done with a GForce item or is there a separate mechanism to send feedback to the folks who maintain the <a href=\"http://HL7.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://HL7.org\">HL7.org</a> website?</p>",

This resulted in people just blindly joining every pool and then not voting or abstaining on most of the ballots.  We removed that so that you now have to intentionally join a ballot pool.<br>\nAs Lloyd suggested, there is a project team in place that is gathering requirements and I'm leading that team so I'll take your suggestion into account.</p>",

Yes, some people are on the side of 'sign up for everything' others are on the side of 'sign up for a few'.   I suppose there could also be a button 'uncheck all' but in either case, having some grouping makes sense so that people can focus on the sub-groups they are interesting in, e.g. FHIR, V2,  V3, etc.</p>",
