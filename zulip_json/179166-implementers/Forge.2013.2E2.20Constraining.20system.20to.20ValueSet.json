Valueset binding constraints are not always serialized to the differential, due to broken change tracking. You can force a change by (temporarily) editing one of the binding properties.<br>\nChange tracking logic has become overly complex and unreliable.  I'm currently rewriting large parts of the application, including snapshot generation and change tracking. The new logic which will be part of the next release.</p>",
