Now with the new release of forge for FHIR R4, most of them can't even be opened in Forge.  Does any one know if there  is a plan to create the same type of project but for R4?  Or is it possible to continue using and referring to profiles and extension from STU3 while using FHIR R4?</p>\n<p>For example, we have a Patient profile buildt in R4 in which we like to add an extension to the given name called EN-qualifier (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-EN-qualifier\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-EN-qualifier\">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-EN-qualifier</a>). EN-qualifier is one of the extensions in the project Core StructureDefinitions - STU3. Can I continue using it in my profile and how in that case? Or do I need to wait for a new Core StructureDefinitions project for R4? Or even create my own extension?</p>",

The big issue here is that Grahame wants to publish that as one huge package. Which results in slow behavior for Simplifier and the clients we tested with.
