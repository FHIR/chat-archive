We worked with the Emergency Medicine WG and submitted a proposal. It is available at <a href=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201701_Unscheduled_Care\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201701_Unscheduled_Care\">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201701_Unscheduled_Care</a>.  I wanted to see if these workflows resonate with others here and who would be interested in participating in such a track at the January Connectathon.  Please reply to this if you're interested or email me - svoicucomendant at tsystem dot com. Thank you!</p>",
