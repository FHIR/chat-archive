That means each MedicationRequest may have 0..* routes (i.e. one for each dosageInstruction).</p>\n<p>A route, however, seems to be more connected to the medication than anything else, in the vast majority of use cases? </p>\n<p>In the details of <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medicationrequest-definitions.html#MedicationRequest.dosageInstruction\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/medicationrequest-definitions.html#MedicationRequest.dosageInstruction\">dosageInstruction</a>  I read: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are examples where a medication request may include the option of an oral dose or an Intravenous or Intramuscular dose. For example, \"Ondansetron 8mg orally or IV twice a day as needed for nausea\" or \"CompazineÂ® (prochlorperazine) 5-10mg PO or 25mg PR bid prn nausea or vomiting\". In these cases, two medication requests would be created that could be grouped together. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the medication datamodel in the Netherlands we have defined route as an element having a 0..1 cardinality in the MedicationRequest (i.e. outside of the dosageInstruction, which indeed needs a 0..* cardinality).</p>\n<p>A similar argument is valid for the concept 'additionalInstruction' ('take with meals', 'take with water', et cetera). In FHIR MedicationRequest it is defined per dosageInstruction, where the Dutch datamodel defines it outside of dosageInstruction. The cardinality should still be 0..*, but should not need to be repeated (as exactly the same?) in each dosageInstruction. What is the use case where the additionalInstruction would differ depending on a dosageInstruction?</p>",
