For example, an InferredEntity and InferredRelationship resource types could capture a great deal of what these solutions output. Also, adding to the Meta tag we could link resource inferred or supported by InferredEntities to those resources and represent the confidence so that they can be used with full knowledge of their inferred nature. This could greatly improve the interoperability of this data and unlock its potential be used in multiple use cases. I was wondering if anyone else in the FHIR community is already thinking about this and, if so, how I could connect with them?</p>",
