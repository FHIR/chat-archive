I filter by what I recognize as being definitely or at least likely FHIR related and I invite anyone who knows better/more to update.  It's actually quite common for different WGs to identify different topics for the same joint session - or one WG to indicate a plan for a joint that the other WG appears to know nothing about.  (And I generally send emails when it looks like there's going to be confusion.)  However, if agendas change after compliation, there's nothing I can do if no one tells me (or better yet, updates the wiki themselves).  I have a dream of moving all WGM agendas into Jira so that there's a single source of truth for all agendas that everyone can look at, filter, monitor, indicate planned attendance, etc.  But first, Jira balloting... :)</p>",
