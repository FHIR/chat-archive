Storage approach depends on legacy requirements, whether you expect to access your data by means other than FHIR, expectations in terms of update frequency and query volume, etc.  Read through some of the discussions in the spec (<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/storage.html\">http://build.fhir.org/storage.html</a>) and also scan through the discussion here <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179289\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179289-storage-for-FHIR\">#storage for FHIR</a>.  If you're putting out a net new system, you might also take a look at one of the FHIR open source solutions.</p>",
