Normally it would look like this: Ingesting data to a sql server db or azure sql db -&gt; transform data to one/more dimensional model -&gt; tabular model on top -&gt; PowerBI reports.</p>\n<p>Now, I have been tasked with building a report based on (robotic) surgery data, cost data and more. \"They\" want it to be build on international standards without going in to detail what that means.</p>\n<p>I have been looking at FHIR but I am having a hard time to figure out how it fits fit with a \"classic\" reporting solution build on top of a dimensional model. Is it just a matter of terminology (naming dimensions in a certain manner)? Please help me understand if FHIR could be of use in my case or send me in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nSÃ¸ren</p>",
