        "content": "<p>Hi, FHIR newbie here. I'm talking with Virginia Tech, maintainers of the veterinary SNOMED extension, about implementing an API that could be used to query for the ancestors and children of a given SNOMED concept identifier. I am wondering if there are FHIR specs that would be particularly useful to reference in designing this API. I saw the announcement from LOINC yesterday, which is what prompted me to think about this. Vet Med doesn't leverage FHIR today, but a potentially public-facing tool such as this would be great to build using FHIR as it would help speed up the API design, and (hopefully) insulate against one-off variations.</p>",
