Assuming that the result for a ServiceRequest result in a DiagnosticReport, if one of the Observations in the DiagnosticReport triggers a reflex test, how should the results of the reflex test be reported? Should this result in a new DiagnosticReport? If so, should that new DiagnosticReport reference the parent Diagnostic report using the \"extends\" extension? Is there another way to link the two DiagnosticReport other than creating a ServiceRequest for the reflexed test and linking the ServiceRequests together? I suppose the results could just be added to the parent DiagnosticReport, but that doesn't seem quite right.</p>",
