        "content": "<p>Hi Jonny,</p>\n<p>in Forge, the extension.url child element is hidden and generated automatically, with a value that is fixed to the complex extension element name. You can confirm this by inspecting the serialized Xml output. As the FHIR specification explicitly defines the rules for this element value, we can generate it automatically so the user doesn't have to. And there is no practical need for a user to change to manually constrain the url element. Therefore we decided to hide this element and provide a simplified view on the extension definition structure; url nodes would only clutter the UI.</p>\n<p>The latest release also expands the Element.Id node. In an upcoming minor update, this behavior will be configurable and disabled by default. You can then toggle this behavior via the configuration setting \"Expand common elements\" in the Options menu.</p>",
