These are separate, optional elements, so, in theory you could have both date and age for <code>onset</code>, and date and age for <code>abatement</code>.  The <code>Condition</code> resource allows for just 1 of each.  I don't think it was ever our intention that a system would send both date <strong>and</strong> age for either <code>onset</code> or <code>abatement</code>, but I have to ask: can anyone think of a use case where having both would be important?</p>",
