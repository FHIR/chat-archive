Once partners have proven to each-other that they are going to behave, the validation overhead can be turned off.  This said, there are import functions where the source is unknown, these would benefit from production use of validation. In these cases, the validation results might simply route the object to a specific data ingesting algorithm, or might be used to mark the imported data with quality indicators.</p>",

However, if you expose data to others, you're responsible for making sure that the outbound data is valid.  (And if you expose data that's been provided to you, generally the most effective way to ensure that is to keep bad data from getting in.)  Checking data is a mixture of internal business logic, validation checking and pre-production conformance testing/certification.  Validation can be real-time or passive in the background.  The right mix will very much be driven by performance requirements and implementation environment.</p>",
