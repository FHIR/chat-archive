That was also part of my question. But we also have 1 or 2 devices that we wish to incorporate in our offering. These devices are ISO13485 certified, but then data might still stays in China or whatever beautiful country this server is in. For this reason we would like to talk to the hardware straight forward and grab everything in there. For research reasons the entire stream should be available, but for your EHR only events (too high or too low, whatever..). To be honest I do not care if the data is v2, v3 or FHIR.. :-), think it could be any kind.</p>",
