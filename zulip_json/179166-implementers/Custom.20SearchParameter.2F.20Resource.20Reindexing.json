I am currently facing a problem that I could not solve since over a week, maby some of you had similar problems and could point me in a direction.</p>\n<p>We have our own fhir r4 server and i create two custom search parameters for the Resource Task via the Generic Client after starting our application. In console I get the following message \"Marking all resources of type Task for reindexing - Got job ID[1]\".</p>\n<p>So far so good.In case there are already resources in the database, they have to be re-indexed (even if it might take a while). </p>\n<p>However, only the job is created but not executed. According to my research, following class is responsible for this<br>\n<a href=\"https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/apidocs/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-base/ca/uhn/fhir/jpa/search/reindex/ResourceReindexingSvcImpl.html\">https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/apidocs/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-base/ca/uhn/fhir/jpa/search/reindex/ResourceReindexingSvcImpl.html</a></p>\n<p>Since I could not directly use the existing functionality of this class, I created my own version of it.<br>\nUsing the start() and forceReindexingPass() methods everything works as desired. However, the workaround is too cumbersome, so new problems arise.</p>\n<p>What am I missing?</p>",
