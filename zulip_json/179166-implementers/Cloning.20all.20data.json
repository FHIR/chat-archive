Secondly, I have created a script that does it ;-) but it fails to PUT the record on the second server if the Id already exists - but is a different resource type (this is a HAPI server). The Ids don't have to all be the same, but I can't see an easy way to fix up every reference if the Ids are not the same. I want this to work an any server type, so can't rely on special operations or even Batch inserts.</p>",
