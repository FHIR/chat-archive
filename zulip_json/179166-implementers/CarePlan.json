We had some discussion related to this during the Care Plan track at the connectathon last week. We should work out a complete example of including a ProcedureRequest or a Task as a patient assigned activity within a plan, the result of which should be (in most cases) one or more Observations that can be evaluated by a CDS and used for possible updates to the care plan.  The example we discussed at connectathon was an Anxiety Assessment scale presented as a questionnaire that records an Observation with the resulting anxiety score.</p>",

I think the plan for us will be to integrate this as part of the PlanDefinition as a Questionnaire, then in the CarePlan it will be an empty QuestionnaireResponse contained within a Task, as it appears that this is more relevantly linked than a ProcedureRequest</p>",
