        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"214174\">@Ramandeep Dhanoa</span>, if you publish your profiles to Simplifier, the platform will render your profiles, similar to the HL7 FHIR spec. Simplifier also provides a user-friendly online Implementation Guide editor with integrated profile rendering. For example:<br>\n<a href=\"https://simplifier.net/guide/Basisprofilerno-basis/no-basis-Patient\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://simplifier.net/guide/Basisprofilerno-basis/no-basis-Patient\">https://simplifier.net/guide/Basisprofilerno-basis/no-basis-Patient</a></p>",

You can see a list of work groups on the HL7 home page by clicking on \"resources\".  If you're going through an affiliate, your affiliate will have processes.  When they get to the point where they're ready to publish, they should send an email to <a href=\"mailto:fmgcontact@hl7.org\" title=\"mailto:fmgcontact@hl7.org\">fmgcontact@hl7.org</a>.
