        "content": "<p>Hello there.<br>\nI have a question on profiling the trigger for a condition. Our use case is chronic wound management. Wounds can occur due to events which happen at a moment, like crashes, cuts, or surgical procedures, or due to events happening over a longer period, like wearing the worng footwear over a longer period of time. Now we have modeled the wound as a condition which needs to be treated. Now I am unsure how to model the trigger event. Does anyone have a good idea? Thanks in advance!</p>",
