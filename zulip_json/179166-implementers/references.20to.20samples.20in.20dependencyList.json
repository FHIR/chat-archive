For example, a Composition example in C-CDA on FHIR references a practitioner example from us-core. However, samples do not seem to be included in definitions.json.zip packages that the dependencyList uses. So, what should a reference to a us-core sample from a c-cda on fhir sample look like, and how would that reference be resolved by the ig publisher?</p>",
