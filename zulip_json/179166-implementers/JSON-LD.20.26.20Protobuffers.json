Protobuf is cool and Google has a <a href=\"https://github.com/google/fhir\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/google/fhir\">great FHIR project</a> around it. Protobuf is more about performance and developer convenience than the data itself. You don't really see public-facing protobuf APIs outside of Google. For those reasons, I think there's nothing stopping someone from doing FHIR over protobuf, but it would never be part of the core spec.</p>",
