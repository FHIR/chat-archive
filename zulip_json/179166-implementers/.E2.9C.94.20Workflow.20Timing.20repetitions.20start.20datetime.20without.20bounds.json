If someone writes a prescription and says \"take this 3 times a day\" and doesn't specify a start date, the general expectation is \"as soon as you can\".  But that might mean hours or days in practice.  (In the community scenario, patient sticks the script into their pocket, brings it to the grocery drug store the next week, pharmacy is out, so they come back the next week to get their supply, don't start taking it until the next day...  In an in-patient environment, it's typically \"next scheduled administration timeslot that corresponds to the schedule\" - unless instructions or protocol dictate otherwise.</p>",
