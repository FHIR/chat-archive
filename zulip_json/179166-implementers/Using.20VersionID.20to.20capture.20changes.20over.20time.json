If we use a resource, say an Observation, to capture the change of data over time (e.g. Patient Warnings or Social History), what would be the recommended way to indicate that an update is a new \"version\" of an old Observation? I have considered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Observation.meta.versionID</li>\n<li>Observation.derivedFrom</li>\n<li>Linkage resource </li>\n<li>Provenance resource</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I like the versionID approach, because then it becomes trivial to fetch the latest version and we can also utilise versioned updates. However, I'm wondering if we're misusing the versioning functionality and that perhaps it should mainly be used for amending/correcting Observation and not to keep track of updates over time?</p>\n<p>Observation.derivedFrom I guess would work and you would have to look through all derivedFrom values to figure out what is the latest version. And the approach perhaps doesn't work other types of resources. </p>\n<p>The Linkage and Provenance resource has the drawback it puts more burden on the Client, to send us multiple objects in a Bundle.</p>\n<p>What is the recommended FHIR way?</p>",

We are considering capturing some free text data using FHIR Observation, like for example Warnings and Social History. In this use case one clinician might open an old Observation from a year back, add some information, and then store it again. To me there is some kind of lineage between these Observations since the Clinician is, in a sense, editing and updating the old Observation. How would one capture this lineage?</p>",
