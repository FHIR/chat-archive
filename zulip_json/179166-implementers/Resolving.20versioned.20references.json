Should history references be considered first class citizens with all the integrity checks that a local resource would normally get, or can they be considered the same way as a resource on another FHIR server? I see this primarily as an simplification for indexing and constructing compartments. I tried to figure out what HAPI FHIR's behaviour was, but it doesn't seem to handle versioned resource references very well.</p>",
