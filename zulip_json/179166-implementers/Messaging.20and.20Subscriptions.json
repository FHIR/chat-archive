It's not nearly as generic as the typical create/read/update interactions.  Every messaging interaction needs to be coded separately.  And, at the moment, very little messaging has been defined in the FHIR spec.  The MessageDefinition allows you to define the structure for the inbound message, what responses are permitted and what those responses look like.  But we don't have any internationally agreed instantiations of that right now.  And even if we did, it would be a singificant amount of work for the reference servers to add support for each one.  (On the other hand, Subscription is a generic construct - once you add support, you can handle pretty much any type of subscription.)</p>",
