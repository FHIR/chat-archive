However, this is again an open server. Could not really get SMART python library work with their test sandboxes or epic test.  I currently have an app ( same app built it in R Shiny &amp; Python flask) that works well with some test EHR data stored in files locally. This has to integrate with the EPIC EHR to pull the realt-time EHR data , and I understood that SMART is  framework that would help me to get this task to communicate with EPIC via FHIR. I am not technically sound about EHR infra ( Neither FHIR or SMART) server concepts, tokens , oauth2  etc. Can someone please layout a step-wise tasks manner on what it takes to for an app to be able to launch on EPIC interface ( end user is doctor) ? So,  I can get some expert help for specific task that I cannot do it myself.</p>",

I did contact <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194597\">@Sander Laverman</span> , he was very prompt to reply suggested to update httr packages or other dependencies. I could not fix it, hence moved from R and tried python. Can you provide example with testable links for oauth2 using RonFHIR ( with tokens and other parameters it require) The example says to enter so and so information, but does not provide a working links. I tried some of the SMART open and OuAuth2 test ...could not get it work in R.  For Python, could not get their Oauth2 work so far, but the basic or open api works. And, to share what I have tried...can I do it in this chat box or send email ? if so, which email</p>",
