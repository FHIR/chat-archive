What i want to do is to read a fhir resource with a IGenericClient.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>    return getRestfulClient()\n        .read()\n        .resource(resourceClass)\n        .withId(id)\n        .execute();\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>getRestfulCilent does some extra work and provides a IGenericClient. resourceClass is for example Practitioner.</p>\n<p>Basically this works pretty good and i get the resource. In the meta we need to set the versionId field to e.g. 1. What i noticed, the HAPI framework adds then automatically \"_history/1\" to the id field. In general the number in versionId will be added at the end of the history tag. </p>\n<p>Is there a flag or other call to avoid this behavior? I searched already for this but found nothing...<br>\nThanks in advance!</p>",
