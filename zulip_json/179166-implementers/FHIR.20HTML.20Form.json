I want to send fhir objects between two system which works perfectly but in the front end is the problem. Is there any good implementation or guidline for a good html formular for a patient object. The patient object is a central object for me in fhir but there is no good form to enter all this data in a good way? Is this a common problem or do I miss something? Thank you for the answers.

I already found this: <a href=\"https://lhncbc.github.io/lforms/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://lhncbc.github.io/lforms/\">https://lhncbc.github.io/lforms/</a> but i wasnt sure this solves the problem to convert such objects to a patient object which seems quite crazy to me :)</p>",
