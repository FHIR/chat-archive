So a query as outlined above could be run, and a cohort established. The result could be modelled as a List of patients, or a Group of Patients. Which would be the most appropriate? I'm leaning towards Group, as there are many associations set up for Groups within the FHIR model,  but List also offers a mechanism to have a List type (cohort type), and members (as entries).</p>",
