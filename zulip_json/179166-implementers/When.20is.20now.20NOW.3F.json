        "content": "<p>\"Upon dispense\" isn't terribly relevant if you're talking about floor stock or something on a crash cart.  It also can't be \"as soon as the order is created\" - as in emergency cases, the order doesn't created until after the administration/procedure/whatever is done.  My general leaning is to say that \"NOW\" might be better phrased as \"immediately\" with a definition of \"as soon as possible once the request is effective\".  If you're capturing a retrospective order, the effective start time would be at the time the decision was made.</p>",

When reviewing yesterday's med administrations, a clinician can see that he or she ordered a med with the intent that the med be given to the patient immediately. <br>\n2. A clinician ordered a med that should be given to the patient immediately.  It hasn't been administered yet but hopefully will be quite soon.</p>",
