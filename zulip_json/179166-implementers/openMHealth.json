        "content": "<p>fyi: Background: FHIR and openMHealth have overlapping scopes: FHIR is interested in all healthcare data exchange, with a strong interest in social media, openMHealth is focused on exchanging health data for mobile platforms. openMHealth has a narrow focus, while FHIR has a more general focus - each has different pros and cons. Rather than competing, we'd rather collaborate. For now, that means at least showing how to interconvert data, and describe functionally equivalent FHIR and openMHealth interfaces</p>\n<p>Meeting: test one or more prototype bridges between FHIR and openMHealth. There will be at least one bridge, an implementation of openMHealth that is a facade in front of a FHIR server. There may be others if anyone wants to bring them. The intent of the meeting is to use demonstrations and testing of the implementation(s) to drive discovery of the underlying issues, which will then set the agenda for further engagements. This meeting will use blood glucose measurements as an exemplar.</p>\n<p>Meeting arrangements: UCSF campus, Thurs 12th Jan 1-4pm.
