I added the resource into my IG (not to keep it but just to play with it). The Devices group is contemplating defining a new Resource CommunicatingDevice which is specifically a communicating medical device. The communicating device is complex and its needs are confusing to all the other Device use cases (Which has become huge). By separating it out it will be easier for OO to manage and for the other users of Device to understand. They won't need to understand the many elements that are in the Device now that are specific for Communicating devices. The communication protocols are complex and not well understood outside the devices community (unfortunately) so its probably a good idea.</p>",
