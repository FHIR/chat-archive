We are working towards a FHIR messaging spec for pathology (haematology and chemical biology for now) and have varying opinions on what this field should be used for e.g sample collection date. Some insight into what the community use this for in a similar setting would be appreciated.<br>\nThanks<br>\nDave</p>",
