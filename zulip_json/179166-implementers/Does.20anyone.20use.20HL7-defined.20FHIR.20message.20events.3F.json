However, most of the existing Message Events are essentially copied and pasted from other spreadsheets without work groups even realizing they were there.  And even where the work group did create them, there hasn't been a lot of thought put into them.  If we're going to actually define MessageDefinitions, we'd prefer to do so only where there's actually an interest in implementing them so that we can gain feedback on the designs.</p>\n<p>So: If you're making use of any of the HL7 defined FHIR messaging events, let us know by posting here.  We'll yank all the ones no one's using and create proper definitions for the ones people are using (based on feedback from those who are actually implementing...)</p>",
