My data consists of pressure measurements recorded during both inspiratory and expiratory phases. However, the LOINC codes only cover pressure during inspiration and during respiratory pause and not expiration and I cannot seem to find a corresponding code anywhere else for that kind of data. Since the code field is required to implement Observation resources in FHIR, what would my options be? Would I have to create my own controlled vocabulary or something?</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>",
