I realized that is the wrong approach and I need to slice this element. However, I cannot get rid of this setting and get back the original Observation.value[x]. None of the remove options are active and its looking like I have to start from scratch which would really be time costly. Anyone know how to undo stuff? In general I find it difficult to back out of a mistake or an incorrect decision. Any help in this department would be highly appreciated!!</p>",
