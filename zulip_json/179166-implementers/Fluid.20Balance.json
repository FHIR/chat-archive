Then you'll have a StructureDefinition for the \"balance\" Observation which will have \"related\" relationships to each of the other Observations with a relationship type of derived-from.  Here's an example of a simple Observation profile StructureDefinition: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/cholesterol.profile.xml.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/cholesterol.profile.xml.html\">http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/cholesterol.profile.xml.html</a>.  To do the root \"balance\" StructureDefinition you'll need slice the 'related' element.  This example shows slicing, though it's for a different resource: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/lipidprofile.profile.xml.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/lipidprofile.profile.xml.html\">http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/lipidprofile.profile.xml.html</a>.  I'd strongly recommend using a tool like Forge rather than trying to hand-edit StructureDefinition XML though.</p>",

I shall add the profiles to the 'related' element (by slicing)  for the profile \"fluid balance for 1 hour duration\". Is it correct?</p>",
