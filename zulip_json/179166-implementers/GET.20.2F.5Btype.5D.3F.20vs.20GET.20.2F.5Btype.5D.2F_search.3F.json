After looking at <a href=\"http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/http.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/http.html\">http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/http.html</a>, our developers got an impression that \"/[type]?\" is used with GET while \"/[type]/_search?\" is used with POST. However, both work well with GET on the reference servers. Once confirmed, I'm going to open a change request to clarify this at <a href=\"http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/http.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/http.html\">http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/http.html</a> (2.1.0.14 search &amp; 2.1.0.22 Summary) and <a href=\"http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html\">http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html</a> (2.1.1.2 Introduction).</p>",
