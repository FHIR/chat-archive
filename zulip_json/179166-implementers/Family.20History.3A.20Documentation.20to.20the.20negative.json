I was thinking that we could use the .code field, and include my organization's local / internal codes related to \"No family history of XYZ\". This would be akin to our internal valueset.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts on this approach, or recommendations otherwise? Or is there another resource or extension I should consider?</p>",
