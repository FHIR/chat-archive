Thx</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I suppose there could be an example when patients are using over the counter medication and you need them to stop (there never was an original MedicationRequest to update in that case, however there may be a MedicationUse statement). You could then issue a MedicationRequest (without a dispenseRequest of course) to say that you - as a professional - really don't want them to continue using this.</p>\n<p>It is important to relate the MedicationUse with the MedicationRequest for which we have introduced a so called <a href=\"https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/mp:V9.1.0_Ontwerp_medicatieproces_ENG#Medicamenteuze_behandeling\">'medication treatment'</a> identification in The Netherlands. We add that identification to the MedicationRequest/MedicationDispense/MedicationUse instances (yes, we use an extension for that) to be able to relate them together, which really helps reconciliation in a landscape with distributed healthcare providers / systems all making decisions about the same medication treatment.</p>",
