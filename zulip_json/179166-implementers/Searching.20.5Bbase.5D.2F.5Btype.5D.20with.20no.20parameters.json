        "content": "<p>Hi all,<br>\nQuick question on searching FHIR resources. I recall that a search against http://[base]/[type] with no parameters would retrieve all [type] resources, and this is conformant with FHIR. Additionally, the HAPI sandbox also supports this behaviour. I cannot find this documented in the FHIR pages, either at <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html</a> or <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html</a>, so I might just be blind.<br>\nAre there any recommendations against allowing users to query against http:[base]/[type], and based on their OAuth2 token, returning only those resources that they have authorization to view (typically, those resources where the user is the the patient).</p>",

So if a patient is only allowed to see their own Observations, then a query against the Observation endpoint would only include Observations that have them as a subject.  However, typically you'd still want to include additional parameters to not be overwhelmed with data.  (And access permissions might well give a patient access to other patient's data - e.g. a parent to their dependent children as allowed by institution policy and/or the child's consent.</p>",
