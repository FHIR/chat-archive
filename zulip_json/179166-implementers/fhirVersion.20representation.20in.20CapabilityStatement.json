It seems to me that a better choice might be to publish a ValueSet of fhir versions and then represent that value as a CodeableConcept.  The advantage of this is that the value set could include a human readable text representation of the version (i.e.,{ 'code': '1.8.0', 'text': 'This is the FHIR STU 3 Candidate, and the version for the San Antonio Connectathon in Jan 2017.'}).  It would also be possible to publish multiple value sets and setup concept maps to translate back and forth between the semantic version and the '2017Jan'-style versions.    Thoughts? </p>",

The issue is \"what are the allowed fixed string values?\" DSTU2 official is \"1.0.2\". Each intermediate release leading up to STU3 is \"1.1.0\" (or \"1.2.0\" based on the actual version used for Connectathon 11), \"1.4.0\", \"1.6.0\" and \"1.8.0\". STU3 Official started with \"3.0.0\" and is now \"3.0.1\". So, I guess the question is \"how do we know what the allowed fixed string values are?\" I could specify that I support fhirVersion equal to \"1.9.0\" - is that legal/allowed as that was never a published version of the FHIR specification? The current CI build is \"3.1.0\". Can I use that? If so, that would seem problematic as the CI build is a moving target.</p>",

However, I do NOT see how the client would know if the server supports this mime type version reference.  Seems to me the FHIR Capability Statement should now include a field which allows a FHIR Server to identify whether it supports Mime Type reference to version.  I only say this because the references I have read regarding this HTML Header Mime-Type (URL Encoding) is not SHALL or Required at this time.  If I were a client, and I ran into a server which broadcasted multiple version support - I would want to know if they support this Mime-Type feature <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/versioning.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/versioning.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/versioning.html</a></p>",

The server should return the CapabilityStatement of the first one that matches and you can then use that and the Content-Type header on the response to identify the best FHIR version to proceed with.  As Grahame mentioned you can use the $versions operation to figure out the list if you really want to, but I don't think it's necessary in most cases.</p>",
