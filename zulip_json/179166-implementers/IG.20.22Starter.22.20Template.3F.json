I'd like each profile/extension page to contain the stuff most people would want: Summary or Narrative, Differential/Snapshot/All tables (like in the FHIR spec), XML/JSON views of the structdef.  Is there a starter template/project that provides most of this (just slap in the JSON structuredefs and a few index pages and it does the rest)?  I tried using the ccda2 guide as a template (from 1.8 sources), and it works OK, but not great.  Wondering if there is a better starting point...</p>",
