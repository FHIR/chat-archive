I understood DocumentReference and DocmentManifest are owned by StructDocs, yet they are not processing the CR assigned to them on this topic. Last spring me and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192587\">@David Pyke</span>  proposed a  PSS in HSI for \"Document Sharing\" that got killed by the \"HSI can't own anything\". It is somewhat in a re-started form; but it is not clear what state it is in right now.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191808\">@Wayne Kubick</span> indicated he would help get it through. I have tried to get HSI more productive and engaged; I have tried to get IHE more engaged, and I think I have an audience with IHE board. I need peers to help push, as Dave and I are exhausted pushing against immovable objects.  Lack of a consensus organization with critical mass is the fundamental problem. Everywhere I try to create that consensus body fails. I suspect there are bodies ready to help, if they only knew where to go to help.</p>",
