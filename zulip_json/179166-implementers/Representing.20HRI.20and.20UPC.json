It's my understanding a product could have both a HRI and NDC or UPC and NDC or only a HRI or UPC.  In addition the product id is not unique across the 3 different code sets. When referencing the ProductOrService within ExplanationOfBenefit resource how would I distinguish a code to be of type HRI vs UPC? Using system \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/ndc\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/ndc\">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/ndc</a>\" would indicate the code is NDC which would not be accurate.</p>",
