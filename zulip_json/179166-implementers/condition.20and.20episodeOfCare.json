We would like to manage it with one api call. <br>\nFor example we would like to add a new condition and this condition will be used as a chief complaint in the current episode of care. We also would like to retrieve all patient's condition and the current episode. Then we could categorized all conditions (chief complaint or comorbidities of the episode and other condition's not related to the episode)<br>\nShould we use operations on resource episode or patient, or transaction will suit more?<br>\nThanks for your help</p>",
