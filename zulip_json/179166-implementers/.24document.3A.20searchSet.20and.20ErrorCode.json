Note that since this is a search operation, the document bundle is wrapped inside the search bundle.</em></p>\n<p>Today in a discussion with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"193430\">@Alexander Zautke</span> we were not quite sure what error should be returned, and when.<br>\nWe assumed that the error is returned if the composition is not found, so -&gt; 404 and probably when some problems with including resources linked from the composition resource are occurring. -&gt; 500 ??<br>\nThe second issue we are having is the fact that the document shall be bundled inside a searchSet bundle. This complicates the processing of the document bundle, as i first have to unwrap the SearchSet before you can persist your bundle somewhere else. What is the benefit of the SearchSet Bundle around the Document Bundle, and could we get rid of it?</p>",
