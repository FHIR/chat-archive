SOLOR envisions something similar but a bit more comprehensive. And CIMI endeavors to build models that keep those semantics in line. In the height example, two distinct CIMI models might exist, one allowing codes that eitheer precoordinate position or don't, and another that prohibits precoordination but allows a position data element.
