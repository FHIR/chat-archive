I'm trying to achieve one simple scenario in which I'm facing some difficulty and would request your help on this.</p>\n<p>Lets suppose Patient provided his consent to one Practitioner to view his medical history. </p>\n<p>In checkDataAccess I am passing dataId and request_attributes (which says practitionerId='abc'). My question is - do I need to store Practitioner's Id in Consent (under authorizationRule) along with REQUEST attribute definition allowed_values? It is throwing error when I'm not storing practitionerId in REQUEST attribute definition allowed_values. If I store then it works but the problem is allowed_values has limitation of 100 values. So, how should I handle this scenario?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",
