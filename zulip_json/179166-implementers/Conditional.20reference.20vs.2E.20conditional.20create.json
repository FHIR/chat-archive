My understanding thus far is that conditional reference is used when you want the transaction to fail if the reference doesn't resolve to a single resource, whereas conditional create is used when you want the resource to be created if it doesn't resolve (and only error if there's multiple matches).</p>\n<p>On a transaction with a conditional create, when you get back a 200, do you also get back the URL of the created resource?  (I suppose at minimum you'd get back the URL if you received back a copy of the created resource that referenced the conditonally created resource?)</p>",
