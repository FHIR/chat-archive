        "content": "<p>Hi there. Time and again I've witnessed discussions on when the Vital Signs profile is of mandatory use or not for expressing certain vital signs (IMHO hinting at insufficient guidance).  Reviewing this again, I've noticed something that looks confusing and contradictory to me: <br>\nBasically <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html#core\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html#core</a> states that the Vital Signs Profile  is mandatory for certain vital signs (side note:  called \"core\" profile, a concept I could not find a definition for...). Despite the mandatory statement, the section does not clearly specify when it is applicable (only list examples: \"(e.g. temperature, blood pressure, respiration rate, etc.) \". To find that out one needs to dive into <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-vitalsigns.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-vitalsigns.html</a>. This last page is however informative while containing requirements, which seems like a contradiction. According to <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/versions.html#std-process\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/versions.html#std-process</a>, an informative part of FHIR  is \"provided for implementer assistance and does not make rules that implementers are required to follow\". Any views on this (issue)?</p>",

We created a profile for Blood Pressure Panel, based on the VitalSigns profile because we needed to be able to make the cardinality of diastolic pressure 0..1.  Something we can't do if the BP profile is the basis for our Blood Pressure Panel profile.<br>\nI do realize that this can create massive headaches for implementers but, we are still conformant to the requirement.  We hope to have the diastolic cardinality debate in the near future.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191411\">@Nathan Davis</span> . When commenting on BP component cardinality, I understand you are reacting to my comment at <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179256-Orders-and.20Observation.20WG/topic/Vital.20Signs.20IG/near/254248727\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179256-Orders-and.20Observation.20WG/topic/Vital.20Signs.20IG/near/254248727</a>.  I now see two more unclear areas:<br>\n(1) whether the requirement to comply with the Vital Signs Profile does not automatically require to additionally comply with its more-specific \"child\" profile for a given vital sign;<br>\n(2) the Vital Sign Profile itself [not even going to the \"child\" BP Profile] states \"...if you have a blood pressure observation, you must have both a systolic and a diastolic component, though one or both may have dataAbsentReason instead of a value.\". Interestingly this seem to contradict the statements on the very same page about the \"child\" BP Profile: \"Blood pressure panel with all children optional - This is a component observation. It has no value in Observation.valueQuantity and contains at least one component (systolic and/or diastolic).\".</p>",
