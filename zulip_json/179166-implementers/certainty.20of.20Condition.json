Unless I am missing something it feels like it was a conscious choice to no longer have this 'not suspected' possibility in the Condition?</p>",

In this case, a concrete statement acknowledging the belief as well as the refutation of it is useful.</li>\n<li>It is common as part of checklists prior to admission, surgery, enrollment in trials, etc. to ask questions such as \"are you pregnant\", \"do you have a history of hypertension\", etc. This information should NOT be captured using the Condition resource but should instead be captured using QuestionnaireResponse or Observation. In this case, the combination of the question and answer would convey that a particular condition was not present.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
