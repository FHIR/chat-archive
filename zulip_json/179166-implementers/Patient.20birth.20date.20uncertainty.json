In the immunization world sometimes the patient doesn't know exactly when they got their vaccination, they just know \"it was in October last year\". In this case, the typical advice is to select the 15th of the month, but it would be nice to flag it as an estimate. Or sometimes \"evidence of immunity\" observations have an uncertain date (I don't need my varicella vaccination because I had chicken pox back in 2005). It's not a critical need now for immunization, but it's something that might be useful in the future.</p>",
