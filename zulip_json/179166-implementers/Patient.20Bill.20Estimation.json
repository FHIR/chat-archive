There doesn't appear to be a resource that directly supports this today, but most of the data points needed to make a bill estimation are based off the input for a claim. Has anyone used the FHIR Claim resource for exposing patient bill estimation, or is this perhaps an opportunity for a new resource? </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"200670\">@Raymond Delano</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191884\">@MaryKay McDaniel</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191430\">@Paul Knapp</span></p>",
