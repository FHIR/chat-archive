That's the behaviour I've observed from servers anyway.</p>\n<p>This does create an issue accessing these resources from JavaScript in a browser (browser gets between the request and response). Since xxx/xxx+fhir is an unknown MIME type, most browsers will also require the allow CORS header. This would not be the case if the MIME type were application/json or application/xml, but the “+fhir” bit means the browser is overly skeptical about whether to allow it.</p>\n<p>If a client could request _format=application/xml and get a response content type of application/xml (without +fhir) there would be a work around, but it seems the spec says the server must return application/xml+fhir.</p>\n<p>Has anyone else run into this? Seems a pain to have to require the allow CORS header just for this.</p>",
