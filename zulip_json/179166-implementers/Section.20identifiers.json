In general, I don't think this is a problem, but I was just wondering if sections ever need to be identified so that it's possible to determine that two sections are in fact the same, e.g. this medication list and that medication list are the same list?  If so, an extension is not likely to suffice because it will only work in limited circumstances.</p>",

Anyway, I'm just wondering if there's a use case for being able to identify the same list of things across different compositions.  I really have no idea if that's useful or not.  We're certainly happy to drop section identifiers from our models; they're a pain!</p>",
