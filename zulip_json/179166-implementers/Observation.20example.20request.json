Just brainstorming along those same lines, would there ever be questions that have multiple dates as answers...  Date of last 3 hospitalizations, date of last 3 menstrual periods, last 3 times patient has exercised....  I'm sure we could debate whether those are multiple observations or one single observation with multiple component values.</p>",
