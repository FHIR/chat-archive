The normal procedure here in Denmark is however just to book the appointment as patients are in general expected to show up and a patient acceptance is not needed)<br>\n(I have however been considering the appointment patient participation status needsAction - but needsAction is just not the same as patientNotInformed)</p>\n<p>b) After the consultation the patient is informed (and gives his consent to the treatment)<br>\nNow the appointment can safely be exposed to the patient.</p>\n<p>Handling of this at the FHIR-appointment-resource?<br>\n- change of the security labels and a subsequent appointment update or ... ? </p>\n<p>Any input/thoughts?</p>",

One could use security tags, but I would indicate that this is more of a workflow than a security/privacy factor.  The FHIR specification enables many possible methods and policies, so you need to define the policy and method within your domain. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>One could use the Confidentiality code of \"V\" to prevent exposure, however one must be careful that the patient themselves doesn't have access to \"V\". And one must assure that the code eventually gets removed, like after a timeout or after a workflow event of the face-to-face meeting.</li>\n<li>One could define your own meta.tag value. This might be the safest as it present the best chance to fully manage expectations, prolicy, and method.</li>\n<li>One could manage this with a task resource and business logic that forbids the patient access (rather than security policy, using business logic).</li>\n<li>Lastly, given that FHIR is presenting more than just an Interoperability Interface, there will be more use-cases that need to be addressed within the specification than would normally be addressed in purely an Interoperability specification. Thus it might be best to bring this use-case up for specific standards creation.</li>\n</ul>",
