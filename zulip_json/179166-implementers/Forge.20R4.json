Especially due to breaking changes in <code>StructureDefinition</code> and <code>ElementDefinition</code>. You could try to open an old STU3 profile in Forge R4, may have to massage the StructDef a bit, e.g. manually update the fhirVersion element value. However please note that many resources have changed between FHIR versions, so you may have to also update the model itself. I am not aware of any tool that can update all that automatically.</p>",
