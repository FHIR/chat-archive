We've just found #10172 in which the decision was made that the condition should be [0..*] and not [0..1] any more. So, to clarify what to do if multiple conditions of an action are in place and they are somehow contratidicting each other (for example an action has 2 conditions for applicability, the first one is true and the second one is false) we will create a new tracker item.</p>\n<p>As we discussed there could be two proposed solutions:<br>\n- restrict the usage of applicability &amp; co in the kind attribute, so if there are multiple conditions for an action that it is clear that applicability etc. can only be occur once<br>\n- introduce a new attribute for condition to indicate in case of a mutiple usage how the condtions are to be evaluated (either AND or XOR etc.)</p>",
