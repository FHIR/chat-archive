Is there an equivalent page for STU3 and DSTU2?</p>\n<p>I am interested in this because fhirpath.js also has code for creating files with this data, for DSTU2-R4:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/HL7/fhirpath.js/blob/master/fhir-context/r4/choiceTypePaths.json\">https://github.com/HL7/fhirpath.js/blob/master/fhir-context/r4/choiceTypePaths.json</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/HL7/fhirpath.js/blob/master/fhir-context/stu3/choiceTypePaths.json\">https://github.com/HL7/fhirpath.js/blob/master/fhir-context/stu3/choiceTypePaths.json</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/HL7/fhirpath.js/blob/master/fhir-context/dstu2/choiceTypePaths.json\">https://github.com/HL7/fhirpath.js/blob/master/fhir-context/dstu2/choiceTypePaths.json</a></p>\n<p>If this existed as part of the FHIR release files, we could remove some code from fhirpath.js.</p>",
