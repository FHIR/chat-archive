It is these that are less clear, right?<br>\nI am not sure there needs to be any different meaning if missing for Period datatype values. The Period datatype is clear about missing start means unknown. What is not made clear is that for query purposes an unknown start should be viewed as starting at zero time. Seems only thing missing is this query behavior relative to a missing start value on a Period datatype.  this kind of guidance would be better than no guidance. this kind of guidance would return more results than might be needed, but would not miss results that should be seen... This is the precedence found in XDS/XCA regarding this.<br>\nOther timing datatypes are less confusing.</p>",
