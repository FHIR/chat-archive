This is based on the recognition that when using FHIR as an API to XDS/XCA; one must proxy both the Registry and Repositories through that API service, thus that service can manipulate the URL at the same time it manipulates the DocumentEntry. And that manipulation algorithm does not need to be understood by anyone other than that API service. Thus the algorithm does not need to be standardized or publicized. This allows that API service to be as creative as it needs/wants to be. The client side behaves the same.</p>",
