This occurs when reading back resources that have been written using RI/HAPI when the resource contains a repeating primitive element with no value but has an extension. For example, <code>timingTiming.event</code> in <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/activitydefinition-example.json.html\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/activitydefinition-example.json.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/activitydefinition-example.json.html</a>. This is fixed in R5 parser but is not back ported to R3/R4. It would be really appreciated if it could be back ported to STU3 (and also R4).</p>",
