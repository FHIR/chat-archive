With a \"code\", the expectation is that all implementations have a complete copy of the code system locally and are capable of mapping it to an appropriate display.

What does this mean: \"that won't affect what goes over the wire\"? What display value shall be used over the wire? Only \"main display\" CodeSystem.concept.display? Or could there alternatively be CodeSystem.concept.designation.value (where the translation of the display is). </p>\n<p>I ended this contemplation when I researched International Patient Summary Implementation Guide.
