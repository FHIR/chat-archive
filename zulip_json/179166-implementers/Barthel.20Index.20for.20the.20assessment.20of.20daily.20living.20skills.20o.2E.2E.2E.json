This index is divided into a scale, which can only have the values 0, 5, 10 and 15.<br>\nAn example: It is evaluated whether the patient can get up allone from a chair. The score can be 0, 5, 10 or 15.The scores are linked to different meanings, but these are not to be presented.  A value set is therefore excluded.<br>\nWe would like to use an observation and map the result (one of the values 0, 5, 10 or 15) into value[x].valueQuantity. Is it possible to say that in value[x].valueQuantity only the values 0, 5, 10 and 15 are possible?<br>\nIf not, is another type suitable, perhaps value[x].integer or value[x].string?</p>",
