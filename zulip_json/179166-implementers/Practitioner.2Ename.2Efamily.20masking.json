Does exposing last initial meet the requirement. We will expose full names for provider and b2b access. Thoughts?</p>",

We've long supported a \"patient-facing name\" for providers that applies to all patient-facing exchanges (patient portal, APIs,  after visit summaries, etc.), and organizations can populate that with a masked name if they so choose (this can be used for a subset of users, e.g. nurses).  I agree that getting clarification that this is ok would be great (probably from ONC rather than US Core though), but I hope it isn't controversial masking be allowed, at least for many provider types.  You are likely to know and get the full name for your PCP, but for other staff like nurses, it seems reasonable to mask.</p>",
