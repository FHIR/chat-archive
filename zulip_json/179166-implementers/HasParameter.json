(You can also search to see whether there might already be an existing topic to continue the discussion of.)  In this case, you posted to the a topic called \"NLM VSAC Server\", which wasn't really related to your question.  As an administrator, I'm going to take the liberty of re-categorizing your posts to a different topic name.  Also, it wasn't wrong to raise your question here, however the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179167\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179167-hapi\">#hapi</a> stream is more actively monitored by the HAPI folks and you'll probably get a response there faster.  </p>\n<p>(<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192166\">@Jean Duteau</span> will provide a bit more friendly guidance next time - Zulip isn't always intuitive to people who are new to it, and even old-hands sometimes post things in an inappropriate from time to time <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span>)</p>",
