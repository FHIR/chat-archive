The GCP implementation almost supports a public gRPC API but we haven't quite got around to finishing it and publishing the service protos. There are a bunch of http headers that have to go into request fields. Any full URL being returned is likely to look like a REST URL, which makes following search pagination links in gRPC tricky. Probably a few other issues that I can't remember offhand - it is not trivial to adapt the REST API.</p>\n<p>The beta docs describe the parts of the interface that we built so far (STU3 only, not all methods): <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.healthcare.v1beta1/fhir/stu3.grpc\">https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.healthcare.v1beta1/fhir/stu3.grpc</a></p>\n<p>We get occasional interest from potential users but most people using an interoperability standard just want the interoperable interface.</p>",
