So I see in the IG the section on representing the data and searches - <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/implementation.html#representing-and-searching-provider-directory-data\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/implementation.html#representing-and-searching-provider-directory-data</a></p>\n<p>I'm wondering what the API search queries the server must support look like in practice. For instance for the first row, General Search, Pharmacy &gt; HealthcareService.category, HealthcareService.specialty &gt; Location, network, what would an example query search look like for that row?</p>\n<p>Apologies if this was previously discussed but I didn't see it in the stream above.</p>",

In the meantime, could you just describe a simple example of searching a HealthcareService by category and location? Would that require the server to support _revinclude to get from HealthcareService to referenced Location resources ? Or maybe totally off base there</p>",
