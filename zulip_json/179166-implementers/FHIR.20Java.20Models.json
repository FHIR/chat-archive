Up to version 1.4 we were able to download Java models from the main and download pages, e.g. \"Java\" at <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2016May/downloads.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2016May/downloads.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/2016May/downloads.html</a> linked to <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2016May/fhir-1.4.0-Java-1.0.zip\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2016May/fhir-1.4.0-Java-1.0.zip\">http://hl7.org/fhir/2016May/fhir-1.4.0-Java-1.0.zip</a>. But in the current and 2016Sep versions \"Java\" doesn't have a link. The file is still available for download by entering <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2016Sep/fhir-1.6.0-Java-1.0.zip\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2016Sep/fhir-1.6.0-Java-1.0.zip\">http://hl7.org/fhir/2016Sep/fhir-1.6.0-Java-1.0.zip</a> or <a href=\"http://hl7-fhir.github.io/fhir-1.7.0-Java-1.0.zip\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7-fhir.github.io/fhir-1.7.0-Java-1.0.zip\">http://hl7-fhir.github.io/fhir-1.7.0-Java-1.0.zip</a>, but since it's hidden, I'm wondering whether we are not supposed to keep using it.</p>",
