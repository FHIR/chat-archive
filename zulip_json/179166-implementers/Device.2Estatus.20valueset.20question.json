A 'required' binding means you must use those code and only those codes (though it's fine if you support only a limited subset).  The notion of 'recalled' seems like it could be conveyed in statusReason (where the actual status would be 'inactive').  statusReason is extensible, which means you can send other codes if the notion isn't covered by one of the codes in the value set - and on first read, I don't see any codes that would cover that notion.</p>",
