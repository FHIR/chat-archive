Anyway, I would be very glad if I got help as a FHIR-newbie. :)<br>\nIs there already a resource for cancer classification and if not - am I correct in extending the Basic Resource or is it always the DomainResource? Is there a significant difference in the use of either of those resources (except of what's written on the homepage about Basic) ? </p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>",
