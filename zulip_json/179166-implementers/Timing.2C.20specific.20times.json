I would like to know how to submit a tracker item. The same principles applies to how we implement the timing in nursing, e.g. turn the pasient 3 x day. Allthought nursing does not seem to have the same strict timing as medication, but the principles are the same. If we solve this for medication, that is a complex case, it is even more simple for nursing stuff.</p>",
