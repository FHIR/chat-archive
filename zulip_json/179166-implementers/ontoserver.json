All the FHIR API calls are working marvellously, using both Snapper and Postman, but when I attempt to use Postman to interact with the Admin API, I have success with the GETs, but not the POSTs (including, but not limited to, addLoinc). I'm getting a 405 method not allowed returned, both in the csiro sandbox, and VM/docker hosted instance.<br>\nAny assistance would be greatly appreciated, or even a point in the right direction, as there's no obvious support link on either <a href=\"http://ontoserver.csiro.au/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ontoserver.csiro.au/\">http://ontoserver.csiro.au/</a> or <a href=\"http://ontoserver.csiro.au/about\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ontoserver.csiro.au/about\">http://ontoserver.csiro.au/about</a></p>",

However, you should be able to find support links at the bottom of the page at <a href=\"http://ontoserver.csiro.au\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ontoserver.csiro.au\">http://ontoserver.csiro.au</a></p>\n<p>Regarding the APIs you're looking at, I suspect this is because you'd like to use some of the LOINC ValueSets that are in the public sandbox Ontoserver.  I've now added in a version of the LOINC Code System so these should be usable.</p>",
