Or is the thinking that we're specifically including the possibility of PDFs as \"photos\"?</p>",

At the end of the day, though, the vast majority of DICOM images wind up being vanilla photos wrapped in a DICOM header.... photos defined by the Joint Photograph Experts Group as part of the standard, no less.  So some of these different use cases wind up in the same place, and there's less variance that it first seems.   I don't have any particular agenda here.  I was implementing a very basic Digital Avatar utility and was working with the BodySite resource, and it just seemed weird that it wasn't harmonized with the other resources.

If the imaging resources aren't appropriate, please provide feedback. I'd really discourage converting an image to jpeg and them putting the jpeg in an attachment, or making multiple copies of the DICOM image. Not only is this inefficient use of your FHIR server's storage, but it causes multiple lifecycle management issues. I'd much rather see references to the DICOM content. <br>\nI'd argue that DICOM is not more expensive than png or jpg. Storing information in a reliable manner, such that it can be found, retrieved and used years (or decades) later is more expensive than stuffing them in your sock drawer though. </p>",
