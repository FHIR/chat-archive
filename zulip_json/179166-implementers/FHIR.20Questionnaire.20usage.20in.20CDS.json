Yes, it makes more sense for QuestionnaireResponse to point to the resources but that should be driven by the Questionnaire like these are my questions and send me the responses with supporting docs or Resources. In order for this, the Questionnaire should also have a place holder for it, either native or extension. What's your thought on that?</p>",
