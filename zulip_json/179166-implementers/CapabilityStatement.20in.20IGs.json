That will be a common thing to do with IGs, but isn't required.  For example, you might have an IG that just defines a set of data type profile or extensions for use in a given environment.  In that case, there'd be no need to define the behavior of specific systems - and thus there'd be no CapabilityStatements included.</p>",
