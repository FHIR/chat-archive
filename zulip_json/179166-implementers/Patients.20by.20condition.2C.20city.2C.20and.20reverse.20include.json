I've tried this in multiple ways and have yielded no luck so far. Any advice? So far, I've tried: a) Search Conditions, include patients, restrict patient city, chain reverse include references to patient (last part didn't work because chain reverse includes don't seem to work), and b) Search Patients, restrict city, reverse include references to patient, restrict conditions (last part doesn't work because you can't reference a patient's condition because it's a revinclude). Any other possible options?</p>",
