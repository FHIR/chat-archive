I'm trying now to pull real patient data from a health system but I keep getting the error: \"OAuth2 Error. Something went wrong trying to authorize the client. Please try logging in again.\"</p>\n<p>When I switched from sandbox to prod, I made the following changes in my code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the endpoint for Epic's endpoint (<a href=\"https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/api/FHIR/R4/\">https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/api/FHIR/R4/</a>) to the health system's endpoint (e.g. <a href=\"https://sfd.stanfordmed.org/FHIR/api/FHIR/R4/\">https://sfd.stanfordmed.org/FHIR/api/FHIR/R4/</a>).</li>\n<li>Changed my client ID from Epic's Non-Production Client ID to Epic's Production Client ID</li>\n<li>Ensured that the app was marked ready for production</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Is there anything else I should be doing when switching from sandbox to prod to make the authorization work properly? I'm not using refresh tokens at the moment. Thanks!</p>",
