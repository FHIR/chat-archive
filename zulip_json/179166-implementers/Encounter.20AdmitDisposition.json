It relates to <code>Encounter.hospitalization.admitSource</code>but has less to do with specific referrals. It is for example about if someone comes from Dementia Level Care or Hospital Level Care, or from a Hospice. The Encounter model itself haven't named the <code>.admitSource</code> using the same terminology as the <code>. discharge**Disposition**</code>... so we are thinking of creating a AdmitDisposition extension. </p>\n<p>Do others have experiences with this?</p>",
