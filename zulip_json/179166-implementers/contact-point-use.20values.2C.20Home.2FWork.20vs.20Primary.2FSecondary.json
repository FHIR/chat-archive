The caller doesn't need to know that it's my cell or work or home designation, just that it's the main number to get a hold of me on. </p>\n<p>For these reason, when talking about phone, we currently use Primary/Secondary instead of home/work. </p>\n<p>Has there been any consideration to this kind of approach for contact-point-use?

You call a mobile number if its something urgent and you want to get hold of someone wherever they are.  Similarly calling a work number would be appropriate in some cases, but not in other cases.  The purpose of the element is to help the user evaluate which of the available numbers to call for a given use.  It's certainly possible that the same number could be captured as both a \"home\" and a \"mobile\" number if the intention is that that number be used for either use.</p>",
