There are several issues with 4.1.0 and my profiles I know (the validator also complains, but not then validating against 4.0.0). How do I get the publisher to use the 4.0.0 package? I did try to make my own basic control-parameter.json and specify the version, but to no avail. The qa files still comes out claiming version 4.1.0. Is there any way to use the publisher to validate on FHIR version 4.0.0?</p>\n<p>My commandline: <br>\njava -jar e:\\FHIR-validator\\org.hl7.fhir.publisher.jar -ig control-parameters.json -source StructureDefinition -destination .</p>\n<p>The control-parameter.json:<br>\n {<br>\n  \"url\": \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ig\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ig\">http://hl7.org/fhir/ig</a>\",<br>\n  \"name\": \"Implementation Guide Template\",<br>\n  \"package-id\": \"hl7.fhir.test.ig\",<br>\n  \"date\": \"Thu, 10 Oct, 2019 09:43:36 +0200\",<br>\n  \"exception\": \"Error doing replacements - no id defined in resource: Bundle/null\",<br>\n  \"version\": \"4.0.0\",<br>\n  \"tool\": \"4.0.0\" <br>\n }</p>",

The IG is published at a location that people can find. If you put the IGs in the same directory, you'll have problems with the definitions running into each other. For that reason, we always separate all the IGs by their namespace. It helps a lot when it comes to publishing and managing the content. But you don't have to do it that way - you can make it a lot more complicated for yourself and your users if you want. The IG publisher won't stop you.
