So it has code that allows you to query FHIR servers (Epic, Cerner, whatever) and parse that information into Java objects.  As a client, it doesn't connect to databases, it connects to FHIR interfaces.</p>\n<p>It also has code that allows you to receive FHIR requests and store data.  That data storage can be a native FHIR repository or you can map the FHIR objects to a custom data repository.</p>",
