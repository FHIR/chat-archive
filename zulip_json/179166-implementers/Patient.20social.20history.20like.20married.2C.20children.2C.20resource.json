I see <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html</a> says about \"Social history like tobacco use, family support, or cognitive status\" but I am not seeing any fields in observation that can represent the above fields. Can you please kindly suggest what FHIR resource to use for this?<br>\nthanks for your help</p>",
