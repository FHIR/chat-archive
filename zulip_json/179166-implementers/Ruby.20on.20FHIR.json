We are thinking of building a FHIR facade and would like to know what is already available out there. I  did find two ruby open source implementations here: <a href=\"https://wiki.hl7.org/Open_Source_FHIR_implementations\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://wiki.hl7.org/Open_Source_FHIR_implementations\">https://wiki.hl7.org/Open_Source_FHIR_implementations</a>. As I can notice  those are FHIR models and FHIR client implementations for creating FHIR apps using Ruby, but not FHIR facade for already existing Ruby application. Moreover, we would like to have both FHIR client and FHIR server capabilities.</p>",
