I've been trying to figure out how to distinguish between items where a patient can select only one option vs. where they can select multiple options (radio buttons vs. checkboxes).  There is the 'choice' type which seems to indicate multi-select.  The only way I can see to do single select is to use the questionnaire-optionexclusive extension on every choice.  Feels like I'm missing something...</p>",

For example, you could choose a control of 'checkbox', but if 'repeats=false', then you'd still be limited to only one answer.  (Picking radio-buttons when repeats=true might prevent the user from meeting the intention because of the limitations of the control, but a QuestionnaireResponse instance would validate perfectly fine if there were multiple selected answers.)</p>",
