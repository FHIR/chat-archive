I’ve got a custom resource which I built based on Fhir which defines a concept of ‘Demand Request’ the issue is that the timing of the requested period must be within 24 hours but on the resource can be any period. So once someone published that resource, If the server doesn’t have the capability to handle more 24 hours slots, then it has to break the wider period and created multiple 24 hour ones with their identifiers (Id) in which it can be used for all the corespondent transactions. Alternatively I can<br>\nCreate two version/profile of the same resource where one can handle 24 hours a lot and one can handle bigger period if applicable</p>",
