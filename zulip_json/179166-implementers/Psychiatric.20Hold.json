As an example, <a href=\"https://igniteteentreatment.com/defining-5150-and-5585-legal-holds/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://igniteteentreatment.com/defining-5150-and-5585-legal-holds/\">https://igniteteentreatment.com/defining-5150-and-5585-legal-holds/</a> . It seems like consent is the correct resource to use but wanted to confirm with the community.  However, its explicitly a lack of consent more so than actual consent.   Its primarily an encounter level association.</p>",

In effect, the  legal system is temporarily consenting for a patient since they do not have a capacity to make their own decisions so I think it can be probably be implemented in the same way a legal power of attorney is implemented.  The main difference here is that while the power of attorney/proxy acts at  patient level, psychiatric holds are typically limited to a single encounter.  Practically, I mostly want to represent that for a given encounter, the patient has one of several psych code statuses.  Its very similar in use to a code status.</p>",
