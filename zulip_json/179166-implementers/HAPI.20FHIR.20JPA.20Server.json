So if I add a patient resource using the CRUD console with no ID it will allocate me the next way - say  \"id\": \"4\",. If on the other hand I put an ID in the ID field ... it still just allocates me the next one e.g.  \"id\": \"5\", I've tried using simple Ids \"1000001\" and using a context \"Patient/1000001\" with no effect.</p>",
