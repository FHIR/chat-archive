Because deleted resources cannot be found via search operations this appears difficult. For synchronization processes with other servers it would be beneficial to obtain a delta of past operations which should also include deletions. How could something like a data delta be obtained from a FHIR server ?<br>\nGreetings</p>",

Some policies simply mark the resource as inactive, meaning it is still there and gotten the same as any.  Some would create a Provenance resource to record the deletion event while deleting the resource, thus you could query for delete Provenance.</p>",
