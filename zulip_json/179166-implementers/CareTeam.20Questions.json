What is the meaning of CareTeam.period?<br>\nCurrent description: Time period team covers</p>\n<p>Question:<br>\nWhich period does this item cover?</p>\n<p>a. The period the team exists or is in effect? OR<br>\nb. The period the team delivers care to the ‘subject’?</p>\n<p>Considerations:<br>\n- Some teams exist to act if the need arises, such as a resuscitation team. In case of such a team ‘period’ could have meaning a.<br>\n- If a patient has one or more problems, meaning b. would be most useful.<br>\n- However, the meaning of ‘period’ should not depend on whether the team is assigned to a subject or not.</p>\n<p>2. What is the meaning of CareTeam.participant.period?<br>\nCurrent description:       Time period of participant</p>\n<p>Question:<br>\nWhich period does this item cover?</p>\n<p>a. The period the participant is a member of the team in general? OR<br>\nb. The period the participant delivered care in a specific role?<br>\nConsiderations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A participant may have more than one role within the team or may, for example, change form a role with a small responsibility to a role with a large responsibilty.</li>\n<li>If the answer to the question is ‘period of membership of the CareTeam in general’, then how can one specify the period in which the participant fulfilled a specific role in the care for the subject?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3. What is the meaning of CareTeam.reasonCode?<br>\nCurrent description:       Why the care team exists</p>\n<p>Question:<br>\nIn what way does the meaning differ from reasonReference?</p>\n<p>Considerations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>‘reasonReference’ has the same description, but the type is ‘Reference(Condition)’. ‘Condition’ requires a ‘subject’, so it seems that ‘reasonReference’ represents the medical problem/disease of the subject for which the care team delivers care.</li>\n<li>Does ‘reasonCode’ represent the disease/problems for which the team can be assigned in general? If not, then what is the meaning of this item?</li>\n</ul>",
