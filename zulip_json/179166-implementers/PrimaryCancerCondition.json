Lots to unpack though... :-)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Does anyone have an idea how to use PrimaryCancerCondition to represent an active an active prostate cancer?</em><br>\nwe have an mCODE example which shows how one represents an active cancer in the IG, but for lung cancer: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/Condition-mCODEPrimaryCancerConditionExample01.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/Condition-mCODEPrimaryCancerConditionExample01.html</a> </p>\n<p><em>Why is subject in bodySite?</em><br>\nYou might be reading it wrong. subject is outside of body site. if you collapse Condition.bodySite, you'll see that subject resides outside of that structure.</p>\n<p><em>How do we represent a patient with a progressive disease using CancerDiseaseStatus?</em><br>\nThis is an ongoing discussion. Currently, the scope of <code>CancerDiseaseStatus</code> was related to an overall assessment of the patient. \"progression\" was considered more of a status specific to a response to treatment and not included in the mCODE 1.0 STU1 release. We should be considering an explicit way to specify \"progression\" or \"remission\" for a possible STU2 release.   While it's not optimal by far (and clinically ambiguous if one considers wholistic patient care), I suppose you can loosely infer cancer progression as \"Patient's condition worsened\" in the <code>mcode-condition-status-trend-vs</code> value set until there is a better approach.  (cc: <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"191447\">Mark Kramer</span>  to weigh in if needed).</p>\n<p><em>How would we store data on the most recent PrimaryCancerCondition and CancerDiseaseStatus? For example if we wanted to be able to find all active Prostate Cancer patients in a list for MIPS measures, where the patients condition is stable (not progressive)?</em><br>\nIt's possible today in mCODE to represent PrimaryCancerCondition for active prostate cancer patients and a \"stable\" CancerDiseaseStatus. I think one should be able to create a FHIR REST call with out-of-box search parameters that should be able to return your cohort. Let me see if I or one of our mCODE shr-spec team members can quickly prototype this on our mCODE Logicahealth sandbox instance and show how it can be done.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>",
