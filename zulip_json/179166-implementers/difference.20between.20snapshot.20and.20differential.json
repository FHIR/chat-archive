As an example I looked at the definition of \"Element\" in the profiles-types.json-file. The only difference between snapshot and differential of the base \"Element\"-element is that the differential does not have the \"base\" and the \"isModifiere\" elements. Why do elements appear in both structures that are exactly alike ? I would have thought the snapshot only contains everthing that is new in the definition as a whole and the differential contains only the stuff that has changed regarding the super type.<br>\nGreetings</p>",
