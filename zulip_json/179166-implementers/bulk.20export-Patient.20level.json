Have you searched for and read through the tutorials on Bulk Data?  What have you tried?  What problems are you having?  Answers given here are from other folks like yourself on a voluntary basis, so if you want good answers, you need to provide more detail about what problem(s) you're running into.</p>\n<p>My understanding is that bulk data has no intrinsic size limitations.  If you want to share 500 TB of data, then that's theoretically possible.  That said, individual implementations may well impose limits on how much they're willing to share in response to a particular request due to their own technical and performance considerations.</p>",
