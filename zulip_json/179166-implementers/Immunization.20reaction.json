We do have a Jira ticket (<a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-28093\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-28093</a>) to change reaction to a CodeableConcept to allow a coded value but we weren't planning on adding a reference to AllergyIntolerance. There are notes in the Jira ticket from discussions with the Patient Care WG and if I recall, we drew some similarities between AllergyIntolerance.reaction and Immunization.reaction.</p>",
