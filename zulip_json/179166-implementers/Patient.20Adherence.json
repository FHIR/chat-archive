MedicationStatement can be used to reflect what the patient is actually taking, but if you're wanting to make a descriptive assertion such as \"compliant\", \"non-compliant\", \"partially-compliant\", Observation is probably your best bet.  The Observation could point to the MedicationRequest in question.</p>",
