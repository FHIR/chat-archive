The error is<br>\n<code>search param \"value-quantity is of unexpected data type:\" class org.hl7.fhir.r4.model.SampledData</code><br>\nI assume its coming from one of my two valueSampledData entries but I am not sure. It looks as follows:<br>\n<code>               \"valueSampledData\": {\n                    \"origin\": {\n                        \"value\": 0,\n                        \"system\": \"http://unitsofmeasure.org\",\n                        \"code\": \"{beat}/min\"\n                    },\n                    \"period\": 125000.0,\n                    \"factor\": 1,\n                    \"dimensions\": 1,\n                    \"data\": \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 51 51 41 41 41 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40\"\n                },</code><br>\nwhich seems okay unless I am missing something obvious...</p>",

So then I thought I should probably resubmit it. Given the similarity it probably has the same fix. But what I really want to know is if I am doing something wrong on the upload end...</p>",
