I want to express that certain actions should occur a certain amount of time after the patient's enrollment into the program. For instance a welcome call should take place 1 week after enrollment, smoking cessation should be offered 2 weeks after enrollment. I am confused which of the many options of the Timing datatype should be combined to express this? Do I use a repeat with Count 1 and an offset?</p>",
