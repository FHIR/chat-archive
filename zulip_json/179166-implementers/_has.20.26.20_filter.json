Now with \"_\" allowed as nameCharStart, _has could be used in such a query. Yet, I don't see a way of using it, because in my opinion a \":\"  would still be rejected by the grammar?  Would it make sense to extend paramPath in such a way that it allows a inline \"[filter]\" incl. chaining or a \":\" for using reverse chaining?</p>",
