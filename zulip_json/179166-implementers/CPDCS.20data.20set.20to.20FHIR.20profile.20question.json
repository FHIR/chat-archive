I apologize if this is not the correct platform to ask this question.<br>\nUnder patient access API rule, we are required to expose all the data covered by the data spec published (see attached word doc). Per this document, all the FHIR profiles listed in the document are needed to be exposed and they are listed here: EOB, EOB Inpatient Institutional, EOB Outpatient Institutional, EOB Professional and non-clinician, EOB Pharmacy, Patient, Practitioner, Organization and Coverage. Is there any reason/need to expose FHIR APIs that are not mentioned the CPCPDS data spec (i.e. claims, claims response) but certainly related to FHIR profiles mentioned in the CPCDS data set. </p>\n<p>We obtained CPCDS data doc/mapping guide from the URLs below <br>\n1) <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/Common_Payer_Consumer_Data_Set.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/Common_Payer_Consumer_Data_Set.html</a><br>\n2) <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/Background.html#the-carin-alliance\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/Background.html#the-carin-alliance</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/Ixnit-MHSIG6EV0n9ZmNDl-f/CPCDS-Data-Dictionary-and-Resource-Mapping-Tables-0903-2020.docx\">CPCDS-Data-Dictionary-and-Resource-Mapping-Tables-0903-2020.docx</a> </p>\n<p>Appreciate any feedback. thanks! -seikh</p>",
