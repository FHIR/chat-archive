(Simple example: A \"Condition\" logical model might have a field whose type is a \"Status\" logical model).  This type should _not_ be a reference -- but is more like an inlined type.</p>\n<p>The doc on ElementDefinition.type.code says: \"Absolute URLs are only allowed in logical models.\"  This led me to believe that in the case noted above, the type.code should be (or at least could be) the absolute URI of Status.</p>\n<p>When I do this and run the IG publisher, however, the generated table shows the type as the URI and doesn't link to the page for that type (it's just plain, non-linked text).  If I make it a reference, however, (with code as \"Reference\" and profile as the URI), it appears as nice linked text to the type (showing the type's name instead of URI).</p>\n<p>It would be great to have the IG render the non-reference types in the same way (as linked type names).  Am I just doing this wrong, or is this a limitation of the IG publisher?  I'm using STU3 w/ the STU3 IG publisher jar.</p>",
