Sometimes also known as \"primary\" and \"main\". The determination of \"official\" is subjective and implementation guides often provide additional guidelines for use.\"</p>\n<p>We think we should use \"official\" and suggest a change to the definition of \"usual\" to become \"The identifier recommended for display and use in real-world interactions, used when such identifier is different from the \"official\" identifier.\"</p>\n<p>This is related to <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32308\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32308</a> which was entered as a question without a proposed disposition but we drafted the proposed change to the \"usual\" definition.</p>",
