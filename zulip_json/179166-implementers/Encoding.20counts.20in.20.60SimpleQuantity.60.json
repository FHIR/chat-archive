These plans are \"patient-centric\" and serve as reminders for the patient on what medication to take, and for showing others what they are taking (e.g. to avoid problematic interactions between drugs). They are distinct from the prescriptions, but will probably often be given in parallel. E.g. when a doctor prescribes new medicine, she might also give the patient such a medication plan as a reminder, along with the prescriptions (the plan need not be limited to what was just prescribe, it could also contain other medicine the patient is taking).  Plans can also be issued by pharmacies when they fill prescriptions. There is standard format for this in Germany, which has also been implemented in FHIR (_Medikationsplan PLUS_ project, on Simplifier <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/medikationsplanplus\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://simplifier.net/medikationsplanplus\">here</a> - German only, though) and here, <code>MedicationStatement</code> is used to record instruction about when and how much of a given medication to take (as part of a FHIR document).</p>",
