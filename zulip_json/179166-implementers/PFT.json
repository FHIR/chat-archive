It would be the DiagnosticReport and the result refers to Observation resource .Pulmonary Volume Result have observations like FVC, FEV1, FEV.75, FEV3 ..etc. For each observation we have values like predicted result, Actual result and Actual/Predicted ratio. So can we take them as components to the Observation resource. Is this a correct approach. Please suggest me.</p>",
