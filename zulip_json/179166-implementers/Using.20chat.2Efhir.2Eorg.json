I don't really understand your question about \"I want to give this patient reference for observation\" - do you mean you want to search for observations with that patient id?  If so, it would just be <code>Observation?patient=12345</code>.  In terms of your second question, look at the $everything operation define on Patient.  (The operations and profiles tab)</p>",
