I need an URL for web service + related boolean values (eg. allows acting by a proxy if underage, allows acting by a proxy with a mandate). Or other similar scenarios which eg combine id and name values etc.. Can I perform this (in Forge) inside one extension as slicing is not applicable as there really is no discriminator. And the values are not relevant independent of the bunch, so I would not want to make a external sub-extension. And even if I'd use extended extension I am having problems with that in (new) Forge..</p>",

As an extension is only allowed to contain one value (simple extension) OR multiple extension, you'll have to make a few extensions in the extension (complex extension).  To do this you can  use the add button, see screenshot. <br>\n<a href=\"user_uploads/10155/HEMBpJXvtBGCBddmVZPJhNBE/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"user_uploads/10155/HEMBpJXvtBGCBddmVZPJhNBE/pasted_image.png\">pasted image</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/10155/HEMBpJXvtBGCBddmVZPJhNBE/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pasted image\"><img src=\"user_uploads/10155/HEMBpJXvtBGCBddmVZPJhNBE/pasted_image.png\"></a></div><p>Your StructureDefinition would look like this: <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/snippet/sebastiaanraap1/23\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://simplifier.net/snippet/sebastiaanraap1/23\">https://simplifier.net/snippet/sebastiaanraap1/23</a></p>\n<p>An example: <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/snippet/sebastiaanraap1/24\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://simplifier.net/snippet/sebastiaanraap1/24\">https://simplifier.net/snippet/sebastiaanraap1/24</a></p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>",
