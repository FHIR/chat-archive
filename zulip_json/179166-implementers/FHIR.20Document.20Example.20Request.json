A \"FHIR Document\" must be composed from a Composition.  --- I support  making highlevel evaluations of levels of documents that include DocumentReference as a legitimate thing, as being able to manage and find ~documents~ using DocumentReference is very helpful and supports all types of documents, not just FHIR Documents.</p>",
