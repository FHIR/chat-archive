One followup question:  the spec provides an example as follows:  <br>\nGET [base]/Patient?_has:Observation:patient:code=1234-5<br>\nTo me, that reads as \"Get all patients who have an observation with a patient who has a code of 1234-5\".  It seems like it should be:<br>\nGET [base]/Patient?_has:Observation:code=1234-5<br>\nIs that a typo?  Or is the \":patient:\" necessary to establish the reference back....as the spec says, \".....where the Observation refers to the patient resource in the patient search parameter\".</p>",
