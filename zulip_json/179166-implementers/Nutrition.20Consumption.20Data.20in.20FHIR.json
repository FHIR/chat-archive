Data consists-dietary water, sugar, fiber, protein, fatSaturated, sodium, energy consumed etc. </p>\n<p>I got very good post created by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span>  - <a href=\"http://www.healthintersections.com.au/?p=2487\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.healthintersections.com.au/?p=2487\">http://www.healthintersections.com.au/?p=2487</a><br>\nThis talks about mapping Exercise data in Observation resource, it was really helpful. On this post, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191401\">@Eric Haas</span>  has commented that- “next logical step is nutritional obs. food, grams, calories etc. be nice if barcodes had nutritional info – do they?”<br>\nBut could not find any answer for his question.</p>\n<p>Definitions for category.coding.code (for example “activity” or “vital-signs”. Definition of this code: <a href=\"https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-observation-category.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-observation-category.html\">https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-observation-category.html</a> <br>\nDefinition of “activity” suggests that step count, sleep data can be mapped to FHIR using Observation resource. <br>\nSame thing I could not find for Nutritional data intake, no such category as of now in FHIR R4 specification. </p>\n<p>It feels like Observation is the choice with appropriate set of codes but if anyone can provide more insights/examples, that would be helpful. </p>\n<p>Thanks for your help and support. <br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span></p>",
