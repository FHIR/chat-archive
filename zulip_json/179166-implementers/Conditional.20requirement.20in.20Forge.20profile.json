The Observation.code is a [1..*] where one coding element is required to be that of IEEE 11073-10101. So I have used slicing to handle that. Now I have a codingIEEE element with a [1..1] cardinality. However, if the measurement happens to be a vital sign, FHIR requires the use of LOINC. So I need to make a second slice called codingLOINC but its cardinality is [0..1] because not all PHD measurements are vital signs. So somehow I need to indicate that the element is required when a vital sign but optional otherwise. I can put such information in the edit boxes. Is that the best I can do?</p>",
