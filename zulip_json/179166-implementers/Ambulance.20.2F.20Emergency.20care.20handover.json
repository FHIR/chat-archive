The information content is based on FHIR and the processes are described technically according to IHE integration profiles. The Use Case describes the information flow among the participants during a emergency medical service (ambulance emergency call centre, rescue vehicles, target hospital, back office of the rescue service, etc.). It also maps the required medical, demographic, and other information between the participants (patient, practitioner, etc.).

There is number of reasons for that and that is a complete chapter so I skip that for now. <br>\nIt means that the ePR system at the hospital is either a client or another server. I think we need to come back to what architecture you have chosen.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow up from yesterday:</strong><br>\nYesterday we decided to share a spreadsheet to describe the profiles that are around the world divided into the three main categories. <br>\nabout the three different steps in a CareEpisode. <br>\n1[BASE (a reference to the incident init, the Patient, The Call sign of the ambulance, Destination and ETA,  Location... etc) ]<br>\n2[Diagnostics and Medications( Vital signs, Triage, Info about the accident e.g. Falls, Stroke etc, and Medics given to the patient)]<br>\n3)[handover(The Summary section when the Ambulance crew hand over the patient to the next care provider,  This may also include km driven, waiting time at the emergency, etc ...so it can be more than one report.)</p>\n<p>Cambio will send out the spreadsheet.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>General Contribution from Ortivus:</strong><br>\nWe think FHIR is a very good initiative and since the ambulance is one of the first steps in a patient journey it is essential that the data is in a good structure. </p>\n<p>Ortivus started with telemedicine and send ECG in realtime from ambulance to hospitals about 34 years ago and we have quite many examples of good and bad integrations long before FHIR. </p>\n<p>If anyone wants a quick brief on the use cases on how ambulance monitoring and ePRs solve a few specific needs we are happy to set that up.</p>\n<p>As I said yesterday, the ambulances are moving away from taxi service to becoming a care-provider and the need for understanding the works that are done in helicopters, IntesiveCare Ambulances, First Responders and normal 1-2 patient ambulances.<br>\nPing me in a PM if you are interested in this as this is a separate topic from profiling but rather repeating the use cases.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Have a Nice Day everybody.</p>\n<p>Daniel Bernås, Team Leader R&amp;D at Ortivus AB, +46 730 355 741<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:daniel.bernas@ortivus.com\" title=\"mailto:daniel.bernas@ortivus.com\">daniel.bernas@ortivus.com</a></p>",
