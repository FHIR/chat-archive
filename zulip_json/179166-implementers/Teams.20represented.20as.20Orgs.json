Since CareTeams are generally patient specific, the question was previously asked how to leverage the same team of practitioners across multiple patient-specific care teams, which is when we landed on using Organization to represent one of the care team members (along with patient and related persons).  <br>\nIn my offline discussions with Jenni, I think she wanted confirmation that Organization is the correct representation of a team (in general) that is more dynamic in nature than formally recognized legal entities.  I think her question leads to the contained resource dilemma where some teams may not have global context like practitioners do, which is what prompted me to start this discussion thread.  </p>",

That was all based on the assumption that \"Blue Team\" was an Organization (not CareTeam).  <br>\nNote: CareTeam was previously embedded in context of a CarePlan, which was also scoped to be patient-specific (e.g. \"Note that this resource represents a specific plan instance for a particular patient or group. It is not intended to be used to define generic plans or protocols that are independent of a specific individual or group. I.e. It represents a specific intent, not a general definition. Protocols and order sets will be supported through future resources\").  The same can be said for Encounters and EpisodeOfCare being patient-specific too.  All resources referencing CareTeam seem to be patient-specific.</p>",
