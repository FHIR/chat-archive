I have not found any example about this, and the documentation of HAPI is not very explicity.</p>\n<p>In HAPI documentation about revinclude (<a href=\"http://hapifhir.io/doc_rest_operations.html#Reverse_Resource_Includes__revinclude\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hapifhir.io/doc_rest_operations.html#Reverse_Resource_Includes__revinclude\">http://hapifhir.io/doc_rest_operations.html#Reverse_Resource_Includes__revinclude</a>) it is said that to add support for reverse includes, use the same format as with the _include parameter but add reverse=true to the @IncludeParam annotation, but it doesn't explain how you have to populate the response bundle with the resources indicated in the revinclude.</p>\n<p>Somebody could help me with some example or any indication? </p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>",
