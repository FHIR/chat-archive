E.g. if I want to send a flu shot reminder as a \"campaign\" to 600 patients over 60 then is there an existing structure I should use? I.e. I want to send the exact same message to 600 patients (possibly with templating within e.g. \"Dear {{firstName}} {{lastName}} \" etc.) We have a system to do this, but I am trying to push a fhir first way for our other (service using) applications to create this sort of comms request. I can see how to send 1 message to 1 patient... but not 1 message to 600 (apart from sending the same one 600 times &amp; then knowing which messages are part of a \"campaign\" becomes fun).</p>",
