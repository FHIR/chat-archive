What I was looking for was some information about EHRs actually being the 'targets' of SMART on FHIR invocations.  What I mean by that is that I was interesting in learning about EHRs that can be launched via a SMART on FHIR mechanism rather than the EHR launching an app.    Has such a use case been brought up?   The notion is that the EMR isn't always 'in the center of control', could there be other applications (or app frameworks) that control the launching of EMRs using the same mechanism?  (Of course that would also mean getting EMR vendors to allow themselves to be launched this way.  Even more importantly would be EMRs that can have their context controlled via FHIRcast so that an 'app framework' could control the EMRs 'current user and patient' and other contexts.)</p>",

[It's not about accessing the EMR's data via FHIR in this example, it's really like the context management that CCOW addressed, hence looking at how SMART on FHIR and FHIRcast could be used to solve this workflow.]      Not sure if you remember or have heard of the Orion Concerto product (back ~ 20 yrs ago - <a href=\"https://orionhealth.com/global/about-us/our-story/timeline/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://orionhealth.com/global/about-us/our-story/timeline/\">https://orionhealth.com/global/about-us/our-story/timeline/</a>) it had the ability to launch and control context (user, patient and other subjects) in a web-based portal with the \"EMR\" just being another application; this use case has been around for a long time.</p>",

If you want to get into launching applications, you need to have a context manager - no way to start apps on a system with a REST call unless there's something sitting there listening that can do the launching.  What FHIRCast <em>could</em> do (I think) is synchronize the EMR with what you're looking at in DICOM when you launch it manually.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191864\">@Isaac Vetter</span> ?</p>",

(The DICOM use case is just an example; it could be any set of applications on the desktop that are or can be coordinated by an 'app framework' that uses SMART on FHIR and FHIRcast to coordinate launching, single sign-on and patient context.  In other words, there can be something other that the EMR controlling the FHIRcast context and launching apps.)</p>",
