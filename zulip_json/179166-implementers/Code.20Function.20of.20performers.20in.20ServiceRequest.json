In a ServiceRequest I can also specify the requested performers, but not the function. Wouldn't it make sense to specify, in what function a performer is requested and to have it similar like in a Procedure? <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/servicerequest-definitions.html#ServiceRequest.performerType\">https://build.fhir.org/servicerequest-definitions.html#ServiceRequest.performerType</a> is in my opinion not very useful to do so.</p>",
