Where should I start? I was planning to write code after creating a mapping file that maps FHIR property to a field name in my table and transform table data to FHIR. Am I in the correct direction? I saw a mapping language in HL7 FHIR specs. Is that of any use for me?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",

You should expect some degree of transformation - code mapping, date syntax, local codes to FHIR Codings, etc.  You certainly <em>could</em> use StructureMap, though you'd need something that parsed the CSVs to allow their use.  However StructureMap is really about sharing transforms and you don't have that use-case, so you may find it easier to just write your own code.</p>",
