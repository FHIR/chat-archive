However, I am struggling on an appropriate manner to couple the donor and the recipient. For instance: a living person is willing to donate a kidney, gets matched with a certain recipient. We want to capture that match, as well as the relationship between the donor and the recipient for that specific match, and reference the organ, observations etc.</p>\n<p>I am curious about your opinion and/or experiences regarding this topic.</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nNiek van Galen</p>",

I am also interested to know how the whole workflow can be captured through FHIR. A procedure with a linked BiologicallyDerivedProduct as an outcome and again a procedure for the receiver with linkage with the same BiologicallyDerivedProduct. I could see the 'Transplant, Transfusion, and Grafts on FHIR' project but could not find any further information. Any help is highly appreciated.</p>",
