In order to describe a wound we have a lot of observations, e.g. size, presence of wound exudate, its odor or granulation. Our problem is, that we can't find a way to connect these observation to a specific wound. <br>\nThe use case for this is: A patient has not only one wound, but more. How to I model, that observation XY belongs to wound 1 and observation UV belongs to wound 2?</p>\n<p>I found \"focus\" as trial use in R4, but the resources we have in Forge (R4) do not have this data field. <br>\nThanks in advance for your time and help!</p>",
