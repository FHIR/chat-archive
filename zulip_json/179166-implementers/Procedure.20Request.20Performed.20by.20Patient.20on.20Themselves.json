Additionally, in ServiceRequests's, there is an <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/servicerequest-example4.json.html\">example</a> of a ServiceRequest requesting \"Bench presses\". It's not mentioned in the example what the context for this ServiceRequest is (e.g. is this part of physio?).</p>\n<p>Together, these make me wonder when it's appropriate to use a ServiceRequest to request a Patient do something for themself versus using a Task. For concreteness, let's say I want a Patient to walk 4km. When should I use a ServiceRequest to request this and when should I use a Task?</p>\n<p>Thanks!!</p>",

It also allows specifying method, bodySite and other details.  Task only allows asking for one instance.  Task is frequently tied to a particular order.  E.g. you might have an order that specifies details and authorizes many repetitions.  But you'd have a Task that reminded you (and tracked execution) of the repetition you're supposed to do today.</p>",

In the situation where I only want to ask the Patient to walk 4km once and don't need to specify any other detail beyond that, I _could_ use a Task or ServiceRequest. However, using a Task is quite limiting and if I want to make a richer Request, then ServiceRequest is the way to go.</p>",
