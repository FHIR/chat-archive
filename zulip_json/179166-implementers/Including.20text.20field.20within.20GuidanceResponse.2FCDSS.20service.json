We are developing a FHIR Clinical decision support service based on the STU 3.0. specification but we are unsure about how include the human readible text within the GuidanceResponse.  We developed our specification based on the FHIR specification website but our outsourced development company claims that the provided XML schema doesn't satisfy the HAPI FHIR opensource API.</p>\n<p>Please could you check if our proposed XML example  is correct? As you can see here it  applies the Text field within (parameter/parameters/contained/GuidanceResponse) structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&lt;GuidanceResponse&gt;<br>\n    - &lt;contained&gt;<br>\n        - &lt;Parameters&gt;<br>\n           &lt;id&gt;outputParameters1&lt;/id&gt; <br>\n         - &lt;parameter&gt;<br>\n              &lt;name&gt;response&lt;/name&gt; <br>\n              &lt;valueString&gt;It is required fibrinolosis&lt;/valueString&gt; <br>\n           &lt;/parameter&gt;<br>\n          - &lt;parameter&gt;<br>\n                &lt;name&gt;result1&lt;/name&gt; <br>\n                - &lt;text&gt;<br>\n                           &lt;status&gt;Rule satisfied&lt;/status&gt; <br>\n                            - &lt;div&gt;<br>\n                                 &lt;p&gt;Patient with stroke&lt;/p&gt; <br>\n                               &lt;/div&gt;<br>\n                   &lt;/text&gt;<br>\n              &lt;/parameter&gt;</li>\n</ul>",
