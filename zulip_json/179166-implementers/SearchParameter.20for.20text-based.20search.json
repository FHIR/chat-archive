For example searching \"cancer\" returns any Citation with word \"cancer\" in the description. And searching \"lung AND cancer\" returns any Citation with words \"lung\" and \"cancer\" (not necessarily next to other) in description. The <code>_content</code> and <code>_text</code> search parameters don't match my use case since those are  text-based search \"on the narrative of the resource, and the entire content of the resource respectively\" while I need text-based search on one markdown element. If I create a search parameter as a string type, that means the searching for \"cancer\" matches only the left most characters on element. <br>\nSo is there way to define a text-based search parameter?</p>",
