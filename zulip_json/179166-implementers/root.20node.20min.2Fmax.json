E.g.,  the ElementDefinition for the root element \"Patient\" on the \"Patient\" structure definition has min: 0, max: \"*\" (true for all resources, not just patient).  Given that this is the definition for <em>the patient resource</em>, this seems to imply that a given patient resource can have many root patient nodes.  Should this be min:1  max:\"1\"?</p>",

        "content": "<p>This means that when something <em>points</em> to Patient it's allowed to have a minimum cardinality as low as 0 and a maximum cardinality as high as <em>.  For all resources and data types, the root cardinality is always 0..</em>.  However, some extension profiles will tighten the cardinality of the root to 0..1 or 1..1.  That means that any model that references that extension has to have a cardinality that fits within that constraint.  This allows you to define extensions that are only allowed to appear once in a particular location or that must be mandatory when referenced by a profile.</p>",
