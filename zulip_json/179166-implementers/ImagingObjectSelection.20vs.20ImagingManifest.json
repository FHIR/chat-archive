It started out as a KOS equivalency - but we found that generated some confusion of when to use what (when would you use a DICOM KOS and when would you use ImagingObjectSelection). We looked then deeper at the use cases - and the primary (and only) use case we identified for ImagingObjectSelection was to support IHE Radiology's MHD-I profile. Thus, we also decided to change the name to reflect the real use case of it - and thus, it became ImagingManifest. However, as IHE Radiology looked more deeply at their MHD-I profile - they have seemingly determined that it would be better to use ImagingStudy, rather than ImagingManifest - they are meeting at the end of February and hopefully confirm that decision for moving forward. So - that eliminates the usecase of ImagingManifest entirely - so we will llikely see it fade away over time. This reflects upon the FMM maturity for ImagingManifest (which we pegged for being 0 or draft for STU3 for this resource). </p>\n<p>Dan - does that address your question?</p>",

If so, then \"Yes\", you've totally answered my question.<br>\nBy the way, Brad, I really enjoyed your videos from Amsterdam.  And Lloyd, you were my initial teacher for FHIR, and it was a great introduction.  Thanks to you both!</p>",
