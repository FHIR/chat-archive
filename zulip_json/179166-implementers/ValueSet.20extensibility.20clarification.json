What I mean by this is I would like the codes for the jurisdictions to be more province specific ex: CA-ON, CA-AB, CA-BC etc etc.<br>\nBecause the binding strength is extensible and from what I can infer from the documentation (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies.html#extensible\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies.html#extensible\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies.html#extensible</a>), I can use my own codes (as show above) for the jurisdiction.code element. To cater to the NamingSystem.jurisdiction.system, I created a CodeSystem resource with the various jurisdiction codes and will have this as the fixedURI.</p>\n<p>Is this this the right approach?</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Joel</p>",

Honestly I don't know if the CLD for this value set actually should have all the 3166-2 codes already or not, seems to me it should since 3166-2 codes are a part of 3166. I'm hoping this is not a situation that needs an extension to comply since the codes really should already be in there, so it's an issue of properly expanding the value set definition.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I don't see that we should think that the jurisdiction value set should include all states of all countries. So in principle, it's not wrong to use codes outside the value set for this case. That's exactly why the binding is extensible, and why extensible bindings exist. If you want to argue that canadian states should be included in the value  set, you can. On the other hand, I would expect that Canada does have a defined code system for states somewhere, and you should use that. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> would know that code system</p>",
