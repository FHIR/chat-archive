I would love some feedback on our draft implementation flow:</p>\n<p>-A library of videos would be stored as ActivityDefinition resources<br>\n-Practitioner assigns to patient by logging into the system, selecting the patient, video from library, sets due date, and clicks \"send\"<br>\n-At this point, a Communication resource is created based on the ActivityDefinition<br>\n-A Task resource is also created with the patient as the performer and the Communication resource as the Input (or should it be the focus?)</p>\n<p>Is this an appropriate way of setting this up? Do we need a Request resource in this flow?</p>\n<p>One thing to keep in mind is that this system/flow will also be used to assign other things to patient to do like:<br>\n-Complete a questionnaire<br>\n-Sign a document<br>\n-Review a pricing sheet<br>\n-Etc....</p>\n<p>Thanks for your help!</p>",
