While sushi is quite fast at creating the CS json files, the IG publisher struggles and takes almost 3h on a 8core 16gig gitlab runner.<br>\nMost of the time is consumed by validation and narrative generation.</p>\n<p>My preferred solution would be to be able to disable narrative generation and validation for the IG creation in the ig publisher, as far as is saw this is not possible at the moment.<br>\n2nd Option would be to just use sushi and package manually in a CI step. Which doesn't produce a IG html page where guidance for these CodeSystems should go.<br>\nIs there an easy solution which i am missing?</p>",
