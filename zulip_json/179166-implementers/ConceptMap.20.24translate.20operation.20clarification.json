I see you edited your initial message to read \"is performed <em>using</em> the ConceptMap resource with that id\" (emphasis mine).</p>\n<p>Should this constrain the mapping to source and target concepts defined only in the identified <code>ConceptMap</code>? I could (for example) include only a source concept (parameter <code>code</code>) in the request, and the implementation should use <code>ConceptMap.sourceUri</code> and <code>ConceptMap.targetUri</code> to complete the mapping?</p>\n<p>Could you tell me a use case for using a specific <code>ConceptMap</code> resource?</p>",
