What I need is something like this (pseudocode):</p>\n<p>&lt;element id=\"Practitioner.name.family\"&gt;<br>\n&lt;path value=\"Practitioner.name.family\"/&gt;<br>\naliasList:<br>\n[<br>\n{&lt;context value=\"context1\"/&gt;, &lt;alias value=\"Nachname\"/&gt; },<br>\n{&lt;context value=\"context2\"/&gt;, &lt;alias value=\"Familienname\"/&gt;}<br>\n]<br>\n&lt;/element&gt;</p>\n<p>How can I define this? Maybe with this extension <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extension-structuredefinition-display-hint.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extension-structuredefinition-display-hint.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extension-structuredefinition-display-hint.html</a>? Or is there a better way?</p>",

Systems that didn't understand the context extension could ignore it and just recognize the terms as being aliases.  Systems that recognized the extension could understand when each extension applied.</p>",
