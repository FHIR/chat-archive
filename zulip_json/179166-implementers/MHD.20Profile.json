I am just not personally motivated, closer to de-motivated because of the politics between IHE and HL7 leadership. The actal StructureDefinition is very simplicstic as MHD removes a few elements, and sets a few others as manditory. Someone else, who needs it, should do it. Epecicilly now that we have Smplifier as a registry.... ANYONE can do this... don't wait for me.</p>",
