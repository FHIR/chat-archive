You can reference a full resource, or you can reference a contained resource. The full resource can be inside the same bundle, so it is still local, but not in-line. A contained resource will be more local, because it is in the same resource. So that is conceptually the closest to it being in-line. </p>\n<p>Contained resources are intended for when you don't have enough identifying info to make a full resource (which appears to be your case here - you have no identifying numbers in your example). They are also good for practical reasons when you don't  need/want to have to carry around a bundle, or to de-reference global references. But you will have a bundle anyway in this case.</p>",
