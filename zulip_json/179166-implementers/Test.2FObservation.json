If the test is taken by the patient then based on results , clinician might take some action - like a referral or further tests or could decide that no action is required.  Tests can be recorded as Observation but how would I save the following elements in this workflow. </p>\n<p>- The fact that Test was offered by a clinician and it was accepted/rejected by a patient along with a reason<br>\n- Resulting action(s) based on the test results and <br>\n- how should above information be linked to Test (Observation) entity </p>\n<p>Thanks ! <br>\n-Pravina </p>",
