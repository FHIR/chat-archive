We're trying to move to a process where there's more community vetting, at least for changes that will impact author or reader experience.  That process is just getting off the ground though.  If it's a bug and it's having a significant impact on you, raising it on <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179252\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation\">#IG creation</a> and waving your hands at Grahame or Mark Iantorno is the best way to accelerate resolution.</p>",
