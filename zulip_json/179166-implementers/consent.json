I'm wondering if there is/was a discussion about temporary consent override, which is different from the \"Break the Glass\", though it has some similarity. In this scenario, a patient has either full or partial block, but at the time of the visit gives a temporary (valid for a few hours) consent to access her/his records. In this scenario, the initial request for data (in our case, medication dispenses) returns \"suppressed\" in OperationOutcome to indicate that some information was masked, then a provider sends a statement that the patient has signed a temporary consent (the actual consent might be scanned and submitted the consent management system later) and gets access to all the records. We need to define this statement / resource asserting that the patient has signed a temporary consent and are just wondering if anyone has already implemented similar functionality so that we don't reinvent the wheel.</p>",

Yes, disclosure consent can be modeled with a generic consent resource or contract resource; so can an ACD or consent for surgery. But is there an advantage to doing that? Is a system ever going to do \"something\" with all consents/contracts for a patient, or is it going to want to handle only privacy consents, or want to  handle privacy consents separately from ACDs? Is every query for a consent or contract resource going to need  \"?type=privacy\" tacked on the end?<br>\nLet's say Patient adds new elements to link to ACDs and Privacy Consents. Is that one element Consent (0..*) of type Reference(Consent); or, is it one element for each of ACD and Privacy Consent, both of type Reference(Consent) (potentially with an invariant or profile limiting Consent.type to be ACD or privacy accordingly); or, is it two elements, one of type Reference(PrivacyConsent), the other of Reference(AdvancedDirective).<br>\nIs there an advantage to using one Resource for these varied concepts rather than individual (tailored) resources?</p>",

Per comment: Thanks @John Moehrke. Finally got a chance to go over the latest version. What I'm wondering is, wouldn't \"security label\" be an obvious part of the Exception clause? It seems to me that a very straightforward way for a patient to decide what to share and what to withhold is based on sensitivity and confidentiality. \"Don't share anything HIV-sensitive with this app,\" or \"don't share any restricted information with third party.\"</p>",

I was expecting the use of the .data to be a listing of nothing (all data on this patient), or a listing  of the specific FHIR objects that this consent has something to say about. What the consent has to say is either explained by the base policy (Authorize Research Read) or there is an exception with details. It is in the exception where I expected to put the operation as part of the except.type such as you have included in the .data element. THat is to say there would be an exception type that says 'allow access to the data derived from X object'. By putting this logic in the root, you have duplicated part of the use of exceptions.

The inaccuracies can be explained and won't cause serious breakage, but they will be confusing. </p>\n<p>2) More complex related kinds of agreements will not be able to use author. </p>\n<p>The problem with author (for consents) is that the patient is not the author in the normal sense.  For a normal authorship, the author really does understand the document fully.  If you take a section and ask the author to explain it, they can.  If you ask why a section was left out, they can explain that.  If a section needs to be modified, the author knows how to do that.  The patient cannot do any of those things in a typical consent process. </p>\n<p>Take the NHS consent process as an example. </p>\n<p>The NHS authors worked hard to balance the needs of medical ethics (in terms of providing care based on reasonable subsets of information, or deny care, etc.) with the privacy desires of patients.  They came up with the short hierarchy of categories and subcategories of what will be shared.   The patient selects the consent using a guided selection process prepared by the NHS. </p>\n<p>In that process, the NHS meets the  characteristics of an author.  The patient \"selects\" a specfic consent from among a family of available consents.  If instead of \"author\" the consent elements were \"selected by\" and \"applied to\"  it would be accurate.  But, documenting an abuse of the term author would probably suffice if it makes other things much easier. </p>\n<p>A more complex situation is the consent relationship created by HIPAA Business Associates.  In this case there are three parties: NEMA, Party A, and Party B.  Part A and B need to set up a business associate relationship. </p>\n<p>NEMA authored a basic HIPAA Business Associate contract form.   In theory the parties could use that, but in the real world Party A takes the NEMA contract and modifies a section or two.  Party B responds with some corrections and other modifications.  When they finally reach agreement, 95+% is the original NEMA document and less than 5% has been slightly modified.  In this situation you could argue that all three are authors.  Legally, it's of relatively little interest just how the authorship was split. </p>\n<p>The important legal and operational issue is: <br>\n - Do Party A and Party B both agree to a document?  If so, from FHIR perspective this becomes elements that <br>\n   - Identify the final document <br>\n   - Identify Party A, and show how they documented their agreement (e.g., signature).   <br>\n   - Identify Party B, and show how they documented their agreement. <br>\n   - The contributory authorship of NEMA is unimportant and probably not worth capturing. <br>\n   - There may be some elements to indicate effective dates, etc.  These are inherently nominal and subject to change based on real world events. </p>\n<p>That's too complex to squeeze into an author description.   </p>",

        "content": "<p>One important consideration for FHIR is the needs for interoperability.  Internal system designs should not define the standard interfaces.  I'll posit that from the point of view of interoperability the things that are needed in a privacy consent agreement are:</p>\n<p>- The specific agreement, or reference to where it can be found.  <br>\n- The kind of agreement, e.g., \"a patient consent in compliance with policy X\".  This is needed as a search key.  I also separate the policy from the agreement so that we can have policies that define inclusions and exclusions.  This is very normal and deals with most of the agreement variations.  A policy may anticipate an agreement that adds some permitted disclosures or removes some permitted disclosures, but only specific kinds of additions and removals are allowed in the policy. <br>\n- The parties to the agreement, i.e., the actual parties that agreed.<br>\n- The parties subject to the agreement, in this case the patient and the providers.  I include both because the providers bear most of the burden of performing the agreement and the patient bears most of the harms from failure to perform.  This also makes things like breach notification a lot easier to automate and manage.<br>\n- (discuss) Inclusions and exclusions to a policy.</p>\n<p>The history, authorship, etc. is secondary.  I would leave out anything difficult or controversial and maybe leave out everything.</p>\n<p>The most common interoperability use is system A querying the server for \"what consents apply to this patient\", or \"is this patient subject to a consent of type policy X\".</p>\n<p>The second interoperability use, and a much more difficult one, is to enable processing of the agreement terms without need to fetch and use the actual agreement.  This can be done when the policy has some simple sets of inclusions and exclusions.  When these sets are captured in the summary object, you can use the object together with pre-programmed decision logic to implement those specific policies.  This is very hard to get right.  An immediate and tricky example is a policy that allows the agreement to add and exclude selected data items, and that allows the approved disclosure list to add and exclude selected people and organizations.  Predicting all the different possible ways to describe \"selected data items\" quickly becomes a nightmare.  Predicting all the different ways to identify selected people and organizations is equally difficult.  And then what do you do when the policy includes a possible cross product explosion where it adds a selected data item, but only to certain of the selected people, while adding a different data item to a different set of selected people.</p>\n<p>It will help to separate those two parts of consent discussions.  The first is much easier to reach consensus than the second.</p>\n<p>My personal acceptable limit for the second interoperability use is to not attempt to describe adding or excluding data items, not attempt to describe adding or excluding purposes, and to limit the the inclusions and exclusions of a list of identifiable persons and organizations that are added or excluded for access to all the data items identified by the policy.  That hits the high priority for personalization that I have seen.  The selection of categories of data items is best done by having multiple policies, like the NHS example.  Modifying the data item set on a patient by patient level  introduces a difficult negotiation about the medical ethics and medical responsibilities of the providers.  It can't be done unilaterally by the patient.  It requires a mutual agreement.  Similarly, purposes and roles require negotiation and agreement by all the parties.  Restrictions and extensions of access for individual person and organization are anticipated and can be handled because problems of medical ethics and responsibilities have been thought through.  The policies are ready for that level of personalization.</p>\n<p>The specification of personalization for inclusions and exceptions might also be an area for extension profiling as future understanding of the balance between medical ethics and personal privacy evolve.</p>",

I will call these policies.<br>\nThe Decision Point then makes a Decision about what to disclose.</p>\n<p>I anticipate that each of these three kinds will have substantial commonality within kind, but be very different.  So it's reasonable to have a common structure for consents, but consent structures won't be the same as policy structures.</p>\n<p>I looked at my rule books and training material for child abuse reporting, family social worker reporting, device safety,  communicable diseases, and HIPAA exceptions.  Every one of these agreed that Consent was for the individual patient.  They used words out of the regulations for what I called policy.  For example, in child abuse reporting the rule book said \"If .... then mandatory reporting requires action A.  In addition, iff the patient consents, you can also do actions B through Z.\"  All of them frequently paired the policy statement with a consent statement.</p>\n<p>An argument for different data structures is also in the rule books.  All of the consent discussions were around categories of data and lists or categories of people/orgs.  The policies ignored those and were based on specific data values, e.g.,\" positive TB test\", or specific external real world events, e.g., \"Law enforcement officer with a warrant\".  Unlike consents, policies had either \"all patients\" as in the TB case, or categories like \"children under 18\" in child abuse.  These are very different kinds of information and call for different date structures.</p>\n<p>So I don't expect the Consent structure to be appropriate for summarizing the policy structures.</p>",

It seems convenient when the resource server and authorization server are managed by the same legal entity but if fails in the vast majority of cross-institutional cases. I know, as I have focused on this issue for HIE for the past 10 years. </p>\n<p>As soon as the Decision Point is legally separate from the enforcement point (the OAuth Resource Server) the institution responsible for the resource server needs to communicate it's policies and have a strong federation agreement with the Decision Point. Both of these are problematic. Communicating an institution's policies to the Decision Point is complex (and may be beyond the scope of FHIR) and it exposes an institution's policies to potential competitors. Requiring a strong federation agreement is complex because it presumes a new governance structure for the Decision Point. </p>\n<p>Experience on the web has shown that separating the resource and authorization servers is much more tractable. Policies are then managed by the separate entities (institutions or individuals) separately. This makes delegation clear and powerful. Even in the cases where the two entities are one, as happens within a single enterprise or with an unusually strong federation, are not really complicated by this OAuth abstraction because they gain in legal and business simplicity what they seem to have give up in added, standards-based, technical complexity.</p>",

We use URI as many rules engines have identifiers that can be represented in URI, where the rules encoding might be proprietary or based on some standard (e.g. XACML).

What I'm proposing would allow it to be explicitly defined within the resource using the same <code>action</code> codable concept as used in the exceptions.  It would allow more streamlined OAuth integration.  </p>\n<p>I'm working through the usecase, and am going to try to bake Consent into our OAuth library.  I'll circle back around to this with a code sample and results before pressing further.

I guess my question would be how many patient treatment consent do you expect (and is there any kind of time constraint that could also be applied)?  If the answer is less than 20, pulling the full set and filtering post-retrieval might be your best approach. Other approaches could included extending the scope value set  to include more discrete codes (I would advise against this personally) or perhaps adding an extension for treatmentScope.
