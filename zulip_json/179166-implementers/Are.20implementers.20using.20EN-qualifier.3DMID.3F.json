HumanName datatype defines \"Given Names appear in the correct order for presenting the name\" re: the order of occurrence.</p>\n<p>Have people needed the ability the distinguish the \"Middle\" name, in order to be compatible with systems that define distinct first-middle-family names? Particularly in cases where individuals' given name may be multiple words, like \"Mary Anne\".</p>\n<p>Interested in hearing thoughts, since I didn't see the EN-qualifier extension mentioned in US-Core. (I see Nictiz uses the extension on <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/NictizSTU3/nl-core-humanname\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://simplifier.net/NictizSTU3/nl-core-humanname\">https://simplifier.net/NictizSTU3/nl-core-humanname</a>)</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
