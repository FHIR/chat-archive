Does the person have normal ability to hear/see<br>\n2. Does the person have a hearing/visual aid and if so what type. Answer could be \"no does not\"<br>\nWe are struggling a bit to find the right representations in FHIR for this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>(1) could be an Observation  for hearing/vision and it could be a Condition. For as far we asked our functional modelers, this is <em>not</em> about problems/conditions, but about observations. The observation may or may not be on a problem list somewhere, but that is not in scope.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(2) looks like a DeviceUseStatement. We however have some trouble saying \"does <em>not</em> have hearing/visual aid\" using this resource</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We struggle a little on interrelating the two. On a DeviceUseStatement.indication I could add the notion of hearing/vision impairment, but I cannot seem to connect the observation (or condition for that matter) to it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Is this a topic worth discussing in Montreal, perhaps in Patient Care <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191403\">@Michelle (Moseman) Miller</span>?
