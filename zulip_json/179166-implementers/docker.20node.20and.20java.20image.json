I would recommend you look at SMART security layer. It is a good start, and very painless. Just expect that the security layer needs to be loosely coupled into your microservice.  This is especially true of sevices, which will be looked to implement increasingly complex and dynamic solutions. However all these solutions should be based on off-the-shelf IT, not something all that special to FHIR.    See security.html page.</p>",
