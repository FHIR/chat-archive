I have an Azure API for FHIR implemented in my Azure environment. I built and tested several Power BI reports and dashboards against a DIFFERENT FHIR server set up by another team member. It was NOT Azure API for FHIR but rather FHIR on Azure with an App Service. I didn't set this one up. But I did set up the Azure API for FHIR version. After setting my connections in Power BI to this new URL I now cannot read data in my Power BI reports. I can connect, but I get Expression.Error: Access to the resource is forbidden. when trying to read the data. In the Power BI Desktop.</p>\n<p>I have made the service multi-tenant.</p>\n<p>I have Cleared Permissions as so many of the other posts recommend.</p>\n<p>I have tried using a fresh blank Power BI doc.</p>",
