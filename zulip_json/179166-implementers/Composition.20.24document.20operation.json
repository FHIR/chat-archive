Otherwise my resort would be to file a ticket at the Structured Documents Working Group.</p>\n<p>Perhaps some background information: we have a use case where data is converted to FHIR, where a call of \"give me all 'indicatiebesluiten'\" to the database is executed, which would be all Compositions and their referenced resources - which are separate requests in FHIR as I understand it (searching GET [base]/Composition and then $document on each of the search result resources). These separate request would require the FHIR facade to store all results until the $document request has been made.</p>\n<p>The $document operation isn't clear on if it is allowed to do GET [base]/Composition/$document (without any [id]) and what the result would look like. The text of the operation does say \"Note that since this is a search operation, the document bundle is wrapped inside the search bundle\" - which would indicatie that a searchset Bundle containing document Bundles is an option, but as the phrasing is singular it is not clear in which situation this quote applies.</p>\n<p>The alternative for us would be defining a custom operation which bundles the FHIR requests into one call.</p>",
