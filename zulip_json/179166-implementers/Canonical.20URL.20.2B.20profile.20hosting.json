However in general, FHIR strongly recommends to use a publication url based on a domain of your organization that is under your control. Simplifier allows you to \"claim\" a domain name; the platform will then only allow members of the owning organization to publish on that specific domain.<br>\nCanonical urls must be unique, but FHIR does not require them to actually resolve. However authors are encouraged to serve a web page that describes the associated profile (similar to the FHIR spec pages that describe the core resource definitions).</p>",
