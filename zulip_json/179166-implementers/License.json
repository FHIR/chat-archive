To comply to the government's requirements regarding interoperability, we are defining our own profile on top of the FHIR Observation ressource (as we need to use a different coding system than intended in the standard) and collect a selection of ressources in a transaction bundle. This definition must be submitted to the vesta gematik directory. </p>\n<p>Is there anything we need to consider concerning IP and licensing for our definition when using the HL7 FHIR Standard as a base and defining the delta and a guideline on the data contained in the bundle?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for the help!</p>",

I have read in the German \"Profildefinition\" that defining a new \"Profil\" (profile) (I am not sure if this is just the German term for ressource, as the defined profiles are the ressources of the standard) underlies a voting process from FHIR. What we do is collecting our data in existing ressources, which are all unchanged except for the Observation Coding system.</p>\n<p>Those ressources are collected in a transfer bundle. We want to define the cardinality of the Ressources for our bundle though, like we need exactly one Patient ressource per bundle, one Account Ressource, 0..* Appointments etc. in an implementation guide. Might there occur any problem there? I guess you could also define this bundle's contents as a new Profile for our use case instead, which then consists of the used ressources as its fields. This would require the hl7 voting process and underlies rules, as far as I understand...</p>",
