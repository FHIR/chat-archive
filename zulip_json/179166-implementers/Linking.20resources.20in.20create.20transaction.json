I'm wondering how to link resources in the transaction.</p>\n<p>I'm trying to create a DocumentReference with a Binary. Both new. The 'create' interaction description (in the HTTP section) clearly states that the resources should not have ids, as these will be assigned by the server. However, how would I link to the Binary resource from the DocumentReference resource if I do not yet have an id for the Binary resource?</p>\n<p>Is there any provision in FHIR for this?</p>\n<p>BTW: This is within the scope of IHE MHD. In IHE XDS there is a provision that the source can use temporary ids, which will be reassigned to actual ids once created. Does FHIR have something similar?</p>",
