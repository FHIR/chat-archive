        "content": "<p>Related to the update re: the NCI-T URI and as a result of numerous discussion both in the HTA and with the NCI, all have unanimously concluded that whereas the NCI-M is a valuable resource, it is NOT in fact a vocabulary per FHIR use and definitions.  Therefore, the NCI-M will be removed from the list of approved terminologies and the HTA records for these.  Further, if the NCI-M is utilized as an external terminology for any FHIR artifacts, this should be reviewed and an approved terminology selected in its place.  If you have any questions regarding this decision or need assistance determining a suitable alternative, please feel free to contact <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"235766\">@Julie James</span>  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191503\">@Robert McClure</span> and myself (inclusive)</p>",
