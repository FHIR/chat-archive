I am aware of the description at <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/versions.html#maturity\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/versions.html#maturity</a> and the following:<br>\n<em>The maturity model is significantly influenced by the degree and type of implementation activity using an artifact. For this reason, we encourage implementers to register their implementations . A detailed analysis of the basis for the maturity metrics for FHIR artifacts can be found here .</em></p>\n<p>However, both the registration link and the maturity metrics link are broken. Are implementations still being tracked and is this the way how to mature a spec? Or would I need to participate in a Connectathon and show it off?</p>",

One of my objectives for next year's release is to gather more information about usage so we can nudge the maturity of somethings up to the 4/5 level.</p>",
