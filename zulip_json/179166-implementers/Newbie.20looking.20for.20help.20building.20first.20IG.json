Per a request from John Moehrke, Grahame suggested I start here:<br>\n<a href=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Implementation_Guides\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Implementation_Guides\">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Implementation_Guides</a></p>\n<p>I wanted to find an example, and that page took me to the templates page: <a href=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_IG_publisher_templates\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_IG_publisher_templates\">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_IG_publisher_templates</a></p>\n<p>The templates page references three examples:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/fhir/test-template\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fhir/test-template\">https://github.com/fhir/test-template</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/hl7/fhir-ig-template\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/hl7/fhir-ig-template\">https://github.com/hl7/fhir-ig-template</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/hl7-au/fhir-ig-template\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/hl7-au/fhir-ig-template\">https://github.com/hl7-au/fhir-ig-template</a></p>\n<p>The first one (test template) has package and template folders but no content folder. The other two links return 404 errors. I looked on GitHub for other template examples, but did not find one.</p>\n<p>The FHIR repository itself (<a href=\"https://github.com/HL7/fhir\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/HL7/fhir\">https://github.com/HL7/fhir</a>) has a guides folder, but the one sub folder (ehrsle) does not match the content/package/template I was expecting.</p>\n<p>So, I seem to be missing something. Can you point me to an example of an IG that would work with the existing tool? My goal is to modify for IHE and get that working with your build server.</p>",
