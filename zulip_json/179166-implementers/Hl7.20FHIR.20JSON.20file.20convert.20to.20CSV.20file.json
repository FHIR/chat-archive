FHIR is a nested hierarchy, so you'll have to accommodate that.  For example, a patient can have an unlimited number of addresses, each of which can have various parts.  Same deal with names (and each name can have multiple given names).  You'll have to figure out how you want to 'flatten' that structure to correspond to your desired set of CSV columns.</p>",

Then you'll have to look at the data structures and map them to your own CSV data structure and figure out how to manage the possibility that there might be more repetitions of things than your data structure knows how to handle (by filtering, by choosing one, by modifying your data structure).  There's no one-size-fits-all solution.</p>",

If you're converting a patient resource to CSV, do you want one row per patient, and add additional columns for each name (and how many name columns do you allocate)? Or do you repeat the patient info on multiple lines, one for each name, and somehow link all those lines together? Or do you create some sort of structure that lets you have the non-repeating info in one CSV file, and the repeating info in another CSV file with \"links\" back to the main file (essentially re-inventing a relational database in CSV). And that's just for one attribute in one resource; now repeat that evaluation for other attributes and in other resources.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, resources are heavily cross-linked. How do you want to represent that? Does that full information of a patient's preferred doctor show up in the patient CSV, or is there somehow a \"link\" to the practitioner CSV? What if multiple patients have the same preferred doctor?</p>\n<p>Finally, FHIR supports extensions on most elements--which can be thought of as a standard way of adding non-standard information. Does the data your using have/will have/might at some point have any extensions? Do you have control over which extensions might be encountered? Do you care about expressing the extension content in the CSV or are you willing to drop that information? How will your CSV approach support arbitrary additional (potentially hierarchical) information at any place in the model?</p>\n<p>As you can see, there is no simple one-size-fits-all FHIR (JSON or XML) to CSV transform.</p>",
