Has anyone tried to convert the JSON objects into Apache Avro objects using Java/Scala/Python etc? I need to build an Avro schema to facilitate the conversion from the JSON schema for a FHIR resource. Any pointers on how to create an Avro schema for a FHIR resource would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nMythreyi</p>",
