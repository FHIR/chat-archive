I would like to use it to indicate an alert that the patient record for a specified patient has been accessed by an IT system or person using an IT system. Hence my List's entries will be AuditEvents on a specified patient's record. Is that a possible usage for this code?</p>",

If your intention is to have a List that highlights data accesses, I'd probably define a code specifically for that.
