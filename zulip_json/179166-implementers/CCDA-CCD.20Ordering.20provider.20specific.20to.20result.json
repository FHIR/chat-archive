        "content": "<p>It's been a long time since I worked CCDA, but as I recall tracking who ordered an item isn't a high priority for most things in a CCDA (it's an interoperable patient chart). You could kind of use the author block, the orderer would author the organizer with no results, then when the results came in another author would be entered (as the lab). This would model it, but I doubt anybody would ever look at a CCDA and thing \"this author\" must be the orderer. Plus it muddies the chart with empty result organizers if you have a non-compliant patient. If you are trying to exchange data between two known groups, where you could put a custom participationType value that might be an answer. It likely wouldn't be valid for general use, but internal use it'd be ok. Is the binding on the participant type a SHALL? If not then you can put whatever values you like (for general use).</p>",
