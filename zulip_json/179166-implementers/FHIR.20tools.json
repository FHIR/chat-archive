You can also render profiles, extensions etc and full implementation guides (IGs) using the <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/IG+Publisher+Documentation\">IG Publisher tool</a> - though AFAIK it does not offer a graphical interface for actually <em>defining</em> profiles.</p>\n<p>You may also want to have a look at the FHIR Shorthand language (see <a href=\"https://fshschool.org/\">https://fshschool.org/</a>), which allows writing profiles and extension in a very condensed form and then compile them to full StructureDefinition resources. It also integrates with the IG Publisher.</p>",
