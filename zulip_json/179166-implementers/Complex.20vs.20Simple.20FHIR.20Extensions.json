You could potentially group all of your additional elements into one extension, but if those elements don't actually conceptually belong together than that would not make real sense.<br>\nBasically, I create extensions as independent as I can so that they can have potential reuse.  I do make complex extensions when I have a number of data elements that belong together.  As an example, I created an 'initialFillInformation' for MedicationRequest.dispenseRequest.  That extension had a number of data elements - quantity, expectedDuration, interval, etc. and they were put in the one complex extension because it makes sense for them to be sent and kept together.</p>",

Otherwise, it's generally best to leave them as independent.  That makes it easier to re-use some but not all and/or to use certain extensions in additional contexts.  It also keeps the overall instances 'flatter'.</p>",
