If it does, is the response obligated to be the same as that submitted? The server is allowed to modify the resource submitted if it needs to do so for business rules, so I would assume that it is OK to return an altered resource (In fact it could be argued that it is a good thing).</p>\n<p>The specific scenario is a server that will automatically accept from known clients where the requested slot is available.
