        "content": "<p>We have the following use case: For a given set of values for a parameter X, a measurement is made on the patient (call the value Y). For instance, it could be something like systolic blood-pressure (Y) measured at different activity levels (X). The outcome is a set of tuples (X,Y). For a particular set of (evenly spaced) X - say, 10, 20,30... -  there exist reference values for Y (high, low and normal). The patient measurements are not necessarily made for these X-value. Nonetheless, the reference values are useful and important because they give a general \"reference corridor\", e.g. when plotting out the (X,Y)- values. However, if I have e.g. a measurement for X = 5, I do not have a reference value that I could add as <code>referenceRange</code> in the corresponding observation. Rather, it seems that we would have to <em>separately</em> communicate the standard set of reference values (for the pre-specified set of X-values) and then, in each Observation instance (or Questionnaire collecting the values) refer to this \"external\" scale to say \"When assessing the following data point, take these reference values into account\". Are there standard methods for encoding  such reference scales independently of actual data &amp; referring to them from the data (e.g. Observation or Questionnaire)?</p>",
