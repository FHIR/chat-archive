In describing this in the CapabilityStatement, we can use a special parameter name to mark this special case.  It would be similar to using \"return\" as the output parameter name to indicate that the resource will be returned in the response body.  </p>\n<p>Trying to get some thoughts on this, and if it seems reasonable, then propose it for some release of FHIR (not sure how to do that though).</p>",
