I'm a bit confused on the difference between POSTing an Operation to a server and using GET [base]/thing?_query as a Named Query? I see from the spec there is a distiction in that Operations are executed using the Operations Framework (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operationdefinition.html#exec\">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operationdefinition.html#exec</a>) and Named Queries are executed using a search (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operationdefinition.html#equeries\">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operationdefinition.html#equeries</a>) - but when would you use one over the other?</p>",
