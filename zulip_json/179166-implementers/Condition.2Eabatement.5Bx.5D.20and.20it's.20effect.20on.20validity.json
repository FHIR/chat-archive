And does this have any impact on the Condition's verificationStatus or clinicalStatus?<br>\nFor example, if an encounter-diagnosis resource is returned where neither clinicalStatus nor abatement[x] are set, is the implication that the condition is still \"active\"? Or is the intent that these resources are understood as having an unknown status, but should be reviewed as they may still be relevant?</p>",
