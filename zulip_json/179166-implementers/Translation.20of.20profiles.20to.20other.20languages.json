Could someone please point me in the correct direction if it has already been discussed?<br>\nHow should profiles be defined for use cases where different languages may be required? Specifically:<br>\n1) Should the english and non-english based profiles have different URIs? I am unfamiliar how this is being handled for base resources<br>\n2) Should attribute names differ? Since profiles get attribute names from base resources, are there base resources with attribute names in different languages?<br>\n3) Could instances generated in an English version of FHIR be checked for conformance against a non-English version?<br>\nI appreciate any guidance that the community may be able to provide.</p>",
