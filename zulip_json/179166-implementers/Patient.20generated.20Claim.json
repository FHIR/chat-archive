That seems correct (I've not worked in the financial or benefits area before), if so I'm not sure about provider, wording seems to imply who started the claim (but not allowing Patient). If it's medical organisation, would it be top level health provider (so for Uk this is either NHS England, Wales or Scotland or HSCNI)</p>",

In this case, there are some options for what you would enter for provider, depending on your particular needs. If this was for general support, such as reimbursement through some sort of social program, I would see you using an organization in the provider attribute and supplying NHS England, etc. In many cases the provider is the person/organization that performed the service or provided the item (dentist who did the filling, pharmacy that dispensed the medication).</p>\n<p>Hopefully this helps</p>",

NHS/Medicare/etc., or private commercial health insurance then that insurer could have a web site or app which the patient, that is the covered party, may enter a Claim providing the details of the services which were rendered, the provider etc. and perhaps an image of the bill from the provider. The Claims resource is appropriate for that purpose</p>\n<p>If however, the situation is that the future care need of someone who doesn't have health insurance/coverage causes them so seek income or social benefits then that would be opening a 'case' not submission of a health insurance claim - but one they have that sought after coverage and receive the health service if the provider doesn't submit the claim on their behalf then they could as described above. </p>\n<p>It would be a similar situation to the above if the person was injured on the job and now needs to open a Workers Compensation Case where that program would reimburse the patient for health-related claims.</p>\n<p>The current claims resources are intended only for health claims, to match HL7's scope, not auto, adverse event or personal injury claims.</p>",
