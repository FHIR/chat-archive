This information is used to dispatch the instance to appropriate processing and validation.  We're trying to use semantic versioning (e.g. 0.1.2) where the lowest level indicates non-breaking changes.  We don't really want to dispatch based on the lowest digit and want to have a single validator that checks the inbound content that uses the 'current' validation.  E.g. if we receive 0.1.2 and the current version is 0.1.5, we'd validate using the 0.1.5 validator.  However, that ends up yelling about 0.1.2 not being recognized.  Is it legitimate to declare a profile like this: <a href=\"http://some.url.org/StructureDefinition/foo|0.1\" title=\"http://some.url.org/StructureDefinition/foo|0.1\">http://some.url.org/StructureDefinition/foo|0.1</a> when the formal version is actually 0.1.5?  Other ideas about how to handle this scenario?</p>",
