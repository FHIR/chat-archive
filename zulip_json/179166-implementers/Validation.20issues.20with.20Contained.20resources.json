In my case i have a reference (\"#1\") from the Container resource to the Contained resource</p>\n<p>Simply it is a QuestionnaireResponse which refer a contained resource(PractitionerRole) as the author.<br>\nfollowing is  part from the payload that i am validating. It would be great if you can explain whether is this a bug in the FHIR validator or whether something wrong with the request body that i am sending. <br>\nThanks for the support!</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>{\n    &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;QuestionnaireResponse&quot;,\n    &quot;meta&quot;: {\n        &quot;profile&quot;: [\n            &quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/QuestionnaireResponse&quot;\n        ]\n    },\n    &quot;contained&quot;: [\n        {\n            &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;PractitionerRole&quot;,\n            &quot;id&quot;: &quot;1&quot;,\n            &quot;practitioner&quot;: {\n                &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;Practitioner/76147&quot;\n            },\n            &quot;organization&quot;: {\n                &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;Organization/1077&quot;\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    &quot;questionnaire&quot;: &quot;http://xxxx.com/journal/template/1571&quot;,\n    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;completed&quot;,\n    &quot;subject&quot;: {\n        &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;Patient/1436&quot;\n    },\n    &quot;authored&quot;: &quot;2019-10-01T14:12:00+02:00&quot;,\n    &quot;author&quot;: {\n        &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;#1&quot;\n    },\n    &quot;item&quot;: [\n        {\n</pre></div>",
