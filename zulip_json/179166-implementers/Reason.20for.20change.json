I have seen the AuditEvent exists and can be used to modal rest events. Does it make sense that a downstream service that collects the data from the user, sends the updated resource and an AuditEvent detailing what has changed and who changed it? Is there an appropriate way to link the resource to the AuditEvent? <br>\nMany thanks</p>",
