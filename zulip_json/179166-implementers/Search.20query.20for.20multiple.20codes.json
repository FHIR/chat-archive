I was wondering if someone could think of a way to search e.g. all Observations that belong to a specific patient and that includes some code out of a collection of codes? One code is easy, that's <code>Observation?patient=someID&amp;code=4548-4</code>, but if I have a group of codes, (say, 10) can I get away with doing one search instead of several? I didn't see any \"or\" operator in the docs, is there some other way?</p>",
