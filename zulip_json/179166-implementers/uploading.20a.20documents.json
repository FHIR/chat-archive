So I want to encapsulate things using a DocumentManifest that has content references to DocumentReferences.  The trick is I need to supply the content as well, and I don't want to base64 encode anything, so I want to use multipart mime.   I suspect this might massively break the rules, but the thought was to include the FHIR resources in the first part, then subsequent parts would include the raw binary content of each file.  Terrible idea?  If not, then how does the DocumentReference somehow reference the binary content in the subsequent parts?  is it sufficient to use the DocumentReference.content.attachment.url with a guid or something that can correlate to the name of the one of the parts?</p>",
