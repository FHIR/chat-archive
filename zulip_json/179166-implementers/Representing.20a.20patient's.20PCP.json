        "content": "<p>Hi, I am a FHIR newbie working on converting EHR data that is in CSV files to FHIR. </p>\n<p>In one of these csv files, I have a patient id along with their PCP's name, NPI number and a \"Spec\" which has values like \"Family Medicine\". My initial thought was to model these as Patient and Practitioner, where I would have patient.generalPractitioner point to the Practitioner resource. However, there does not seem to be a way to represent the PCP relationship there. Please correct me if I am wrong.</p>\n<p>I am now considering modeling this as Patient, Practitioner and PractitionerRole.  What is the right way to configure the references across those 3 resources? For example, should patient.generalPractitioner point to Practitioner or PractitionerRole? </p>\n<p>p.s. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> since you had specific recommendations on the \"PractitionerRole.Practitioner\" thread about this.</p>",

I will then create a Patient resource for each patient and create both PractitionerRole and Practitioner for each of the PCPs and have them referenced as Patient-&gt;PractitionerRole-&gt;Practitioner.</p>\n<p>Next question, what is the right way to represent their NPI? I found 2 ways of doing this:<br>\n          \"identifier\": [<br>\n           ## Option 1<br>\n            {<br>\n              \"system\": \"<a href=\"https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/\">https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/</a>\",<br>\n              \"value\": \"1234567890\"<br>\n            },<br>\n           ## Option 2<br>\n            {<br>\n              \"type\": {<br>\n                \"coding\": [<br>\n                  {<br>\n                    \"system\": \"<a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203\">http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203</a>\",<br>\n                    \"code\": \"NPI\"<br>\n                  }<br>\n                ]<br>\n              },<br>\n              \"system\": \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-npi\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-npi\">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-npi</a>\",<br>\n              \"value\": \"1234567890\"<br>\n            },<br>\n          ],</p>\n<p>Are they both correct?
