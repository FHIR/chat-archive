The documentation for <code>relatesTo.target[x]</code>(similar in STU3 &amp; R4) says that it is \"[t]he target composition/document of this relationship\". There are two choices for [x]: a reference to a Composition or an Identifier.  A FHIR Document, in turn, can have two key identifiers: <code>Bundle.identifier</code>(document identifier, required) and <code>Composition.identifier</code>(optional). Given that the documentation for <code>target[x]</code> talks about \"target composition/document\" but <code>targetReference</code>must point to a Composition, I am not quite sure which Identifier <code>targetIdentifier</code>should point to. Is it the Bundle or Composition one?</p>",
