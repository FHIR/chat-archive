Generally, MedicationRequests and MedicationStatements aren't going to include organ/system, chemical structure, etc.  The best you can hope for is \"indication\" (reason) and that's not guaranteed to be present.  If you want to organize information by the characteristics of the medication, you'll have to look up the code in an internal knowledge-base and then perform the grouping yourself.  We're in the process of developing a resource (or set of resources?) that will allow exchanging IDMP and other drug knowledge information over FHIR and that will hopefully provide a way of conveying the knowledge you're looking for, though even then, FHIR doesn't provide a \"group by\" function - the best we have is \"sort\".
