Most likely because everything is based on surescripts underlying api. Strangely I don't see anything about surescripts (api?) documentation or even NCPDP standard.<br>\nSo a couple of related questions:<br>\n- Did you ever implemented e-prescribing, directly with surescripts/some integrators?<br>\n- I wonder if the most low-level protocol between surescripts and pharmacies is closed?<br>\n- I've read a topic here about MedicationRequest/requester and there was a response that Practitioner is the only way if a medicine request will be indeed forwarded to a pharmacy. But what to do if we'd like to have a periodic request, is it ok?</p>",
