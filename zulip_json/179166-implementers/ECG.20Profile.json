Shall I create profiles for individual leads using the resource 'Observation'and add the parameters namely P wave amplitude, P wave duration, Q wave amplitude and duration as the components for the respective leads and create valuesets for normal ST , normal T, ST segment elevation and depression? Shall I also create extensions namely levels of exertion, confounding factors, tilt and comparison with previous ECG report?  Thank you</p>",
