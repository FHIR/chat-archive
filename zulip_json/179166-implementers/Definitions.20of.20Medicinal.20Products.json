        "content": "<p>I've thought about this quite a bit too <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191832\">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> and it does seem a bit awkward at present. It seems FHIR currently has 3 concepts of medications -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Medication - used for instance resources in prescribe/dispense...etc events</li>\n<li>MedicationKnowledge - used to provide reference and definitional information about medicines, e.g. from terminology</li>\n<li>\"Medication Definition\" resources - appear to be a FHIR rendering of IDMP</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've spent time working on STU3 representing terminology definitions using Medication because I started before MedicationKnowledge existed. For my use case there were many required extensions to Medication to support what I wanted to do. You can see the latest results at <a href=\"https://medserve.online\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://medserve.online\">https://medserve.online</a></p>\n<p>Perhaps moving to MedicationKnowledge will resolve some of these extensions (I'm yet to do that analysis), but both Medication and MedicationKnowledge have this strange (to me) modelling with respect to \"units\" (like a tablet) versus packages (like a bottle of tablets) and the resulting consequence of being able to represent nonsense.</p>\n<p>The \"Medication Definition\" resources are much more detailed in their modelling, separating out this concept clearly, but are also much more detailed than the use case I've got - I want to provide AMT and other medicines terminology content via an easy to consume API, and FHIR makes a pretty good candidate for this.</p>\n<p>So I'm really interested where this goes, but I agree something that is probably more maximal than MedicationKnowledge (maybe split it in two first) and then profiled for various use cases makes sense...but that's just my thought.</p>\n<p>I'd be interested to sit in on that discussion if possible...</p>",
