However, in validating resources, I've run into a couple of fields that seem to indicate that this is not the case (for example, 'profile' in the Meta resource and 'div' in the Narrative resource). Is there was anything in the structure definition to indicate whether or not a field should be extendable? Are these two fields exceptions?</p>",
