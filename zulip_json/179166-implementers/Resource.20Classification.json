I feel as though the disposition is problematic. I'm ok with replacing the classification with workflow, but simply replacing the whole second section of the page is problematic.. it's the only place where there's any explanation of the thinking behind the categorization on <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/resourcelist.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/resourcelist.html\">build.fhir.org/resourcelist.html</a></p>",

We provide short descriptions of the resource that we then have to maintain.  I'm fine with the original disposition of punting the bottom half of that page.  The only thing we don't have elsewhere is the assertion of Lifecycle.  If that's a relevant thing, then it should probably be asserted somewhere in the intro on the resource page, not burried here.</p>",
