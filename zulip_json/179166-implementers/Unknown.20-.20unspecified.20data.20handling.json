Our most specific case is the following:<br>\nIn our clinical history, we're gathering the information about a medication treatment recieved by the patient. We're using the &lt;medicationstatement&gt; resource when the medication information is available, via the &lt;medicationCodeableConcept&gt; and everything is going well. We have some troubles when the data about the medication is gathered as Unspecified, n/a or unknown. How is the best way to handle that information, assuming is Mandatory for our backend ( Unspecified, n/a or unknown as patient data about the medication). Is there a way to receive that information in the same medicationStatement or can we use another resource for that specific scenario ? any other suggestion would be appreciated<br>\nThe same goes when a patient doesn know about if in the familyMemberHistory, the related person has or not an specific condition and we need to gather the 'Dont know' or  'Doesnt have an specific condition'. Once again, assuming the data is mandatory.</p>",

Including an extension at the top level doesn't magically remove the need to send required elements - nor to have content in them.  #2 would be appropriate except that the reference to the contained patient doesn't resolve.  It's also not a terribly useful thing to say.  \"The patient is finished taking an unknown med\".  But if that's what you wanted to say, that's the way to say it.</p>",
