I have a question with oAuth2 authorization: is it possible to use other system side oAuth2 authorization and then access resources and insert them on FHIR server with use of an external access token in the JWT format? On one side is Delphi FHIR server and on other side is EHR system which performs oAuth2 authorization and sends request with its approved access token. How should I set up FHIR server and start session with it? For example if I want to get Patient info with request like </p>\n<p>GET <a href=\"https://localhost:966/r4/Patient/12\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://localhost:966/r4/Patient/12\">https://localhost:966/r4/Patient/12</a> with header Authorization: Bearer AccessToken</p>\n<p>what steps I have to do to accept such request on FHIR server?</p>",
