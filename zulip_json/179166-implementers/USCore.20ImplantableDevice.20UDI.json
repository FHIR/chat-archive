Or can a UDI only be placed in the udiCarrier element?</p>\n<p>2) The cardinality udiCarrier is 0..1, but the definition (here: <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-implantable-device-definitions.html#Device.udiCarrier\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-implantable-device-definitions.html#Device.udiCarrier</a>) states: \"Note that the Device may include multiple udiCarriers as it either may include just the udiCarrier for the jurisdiction it is sold, or for multiple jurisdictions it could have been sold.\" In this case, where would be the appropriate place to put 2 UDI's?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help given!</p>",
