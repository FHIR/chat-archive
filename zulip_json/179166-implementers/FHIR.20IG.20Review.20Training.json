In case we run out, availability is on a first come / first served basis. </p>\n<p>Please register by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:grahame@hl7.org\" title=\"mailto:grahame@hl7.org\">grahame@hl7.org</a>. (No deadline, just until we run out of space).</p>\n<p>There is no cost for the tutorial (ONC is covering the cost - thanks); instead, we are looking for to grow our ballot pool size, and also the number  of people able to review IGs during the preparation process to ensure consistency across HL7 guides. Note that we are not covering travel <br>\ncosts for this tutorial.</p>\n<p>We expect to record the tutorial and make it available, and to make additional follow up tutorials subsequently.</p>",
