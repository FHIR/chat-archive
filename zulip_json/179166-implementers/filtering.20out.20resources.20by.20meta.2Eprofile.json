Due to this situation I have to fetch the DiagnosticReport resources for labs by filtering out DiagnosticReport resources where DiagnosticReport.meta.prfile is not equal to '<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-diagnosticreport-note\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-diagnosticreport-note</a>'. Therefore I tried the following query:<br>\nhttp://[base]/DiagnosticReport?_profile:not-in=http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-diagnosticreport-note but I didn't get any result. Again I also tried :<br>\n<a href=\"http://pd-fhir-viewer:8080/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir/DiagnosticReport?_profile:not=http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-diagnosticreport-note\">http://pd-fhir-viewer:8080/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir/DiagnosticReport?_profile:not=http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-diagnosticreport-note</a>, still no luck. Have also tried _filter :<br>\npd-fhir-viewer:8080/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir/DiagnosticReport?_filter=profile pr <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-diagnosticreport-note\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-diagnosticreport-note</a> but didnt get a result, infaact it's failing with syntax error. Can anyone please shed light on this. Is it that filtering on uri is not allowed? What could be the work around. Thank you in advance.</p>",
