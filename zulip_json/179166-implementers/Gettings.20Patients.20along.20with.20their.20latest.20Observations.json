        "content": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>I currently have a web client for clinicians to monitor their patients.<br>\nOn login, the clinician sees a list of patients along with their most recent observations. There are 25 patients displayed at one given time.<br>\nSo far we have not used FHIR; the server returns \"Patient\" objects which include recent observations (does not conform to the FHIR Patient resource). This makes it so that we have 1 API call to fill the clinician's dashboard. </p>\n<p>However, we are moving towards using FHIR. My question is the following:<br>\nHow would I <code>GET</code> Patients along with their most recent Observations efficiently while complying with FHIR (no Observations in the Patient resource)?<br>\nWould I do an initial <code>GET Patient/</code> followed by a <code>GET Observation?subject={Patient ID}</code>for each patient? Is there a way to specify an array of Patients to get Observations from (and have these Observations be the latest)? Please let me know if the answer is in the documentation, I must have missed it.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>",
