        "content": "<p>The InsurancePlan resource Scope and Usage section 8.33.1 [1] indicates “<em>A plan pairs the health insurance coverage benefits under a product with the particular cost sharing structure offered to a consumer</em>” and “<em>InsurancePlan describes a health insurance offering comprised of a list of covered benefits (i.e. the product), costs associated with those benefits (i.e. the plan)…</em>”.   However, I am struggling to understand if the individual cost sharing structures represented under InsurancePlan.plan are ever explicitly associated with individual coverage benefits represented under InsurancePlan.type and/or InsurancePlan.coverage.   i.e., Is it always inferred that all of the cost sharing structures found in InsurancePlan.plan are associated with all of the coverage benefits found in InsurancePlan.type and/or InsurancePlan.coverage?  If so, is the notion of a given InsurancePlan having a different mix of cost sharing structures (instances of InsurancePlan.plan) associated with only a subset of its coverage benefits (instances of InsurancePlan.coverage) vs. the mix associated with another subset of its coverage benefits not something encountered in the real world? </p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/insuranceplan.html#scope\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/insuranceplan.html#scope\">http://build.fhir.org/insuranceplan.html#scope</a></p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191367\">@Brian Postlethwaite</span></p>",
