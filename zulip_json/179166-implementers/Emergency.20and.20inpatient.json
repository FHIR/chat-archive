So there is no possibility for emergency inpatient type. Base information like inpatient is only possible in Encounter, should be in Episode for our Use Case. Just found something in Encounter (Expansion: very small valueSet) but there is the problem with class -&gt; coding -&gt; 1...1 , so linking both inpatient and emergency is not possible. Grateful for any advice <span aria-label=\"pray\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f64f\" role=\"img\" title=\"pray\">:pray:</span></p>",

But when the data comes in and is valid and complete, the status of the patient switches to inpatient. But this happens in the case itself, i.e. in the treatment phase. We therefore need a double identification, but in encounter is just the coding 1...1 possible</p>",
