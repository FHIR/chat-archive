The project that I've been looking so far is hapi-fhir-jpaserver-base but it isn't helping much as the conversion from a resource (as an instance of any of the model classes) to the actual entity which is persisted in the database is difficult to review. As I fear my change could unintentionally break something, can anyone help me out in this regard?</p>",
