I have a couple of question regarding this. Firstly, what was the reason for this (what seems like) renaming of a field? Secondly, what is the purpose of the field? Given an example question: \"What is your hip pain like?\", does the concept/code denote the specific question (i.e. \"What is your hip pain like?\") or is it supposed to be a more broad concept (type of question) i.e. \"Pain question\"?</p>",

It allows you to capture things like the LOINC code that corresponds to a specific question.  It doesn't represent a high-level category - so far, no one's had a use-case for this.</p>",
