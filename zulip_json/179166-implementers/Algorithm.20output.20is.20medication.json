The recommendation would be a medication, I guess I would use a \"MedicationRequest\".  For example, a algorithm analyzes various vitals and generates medication recommendation.</p>\n<p>Is this assumption correct?  Any suggestions to represent such information as FHIR resources is much appreciated. </p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
