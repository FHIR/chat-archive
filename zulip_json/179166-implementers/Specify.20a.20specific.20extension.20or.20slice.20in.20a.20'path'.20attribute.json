I suppose this is also asking how does one specify a particular slice in a path element, such as those found in Definitional resources. </p>\n<p>Here's an example: My medication request resource has two extensions, one of which has the uri \"<a href=\"http://baseURL/line-of-therapy\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://baseURL/line-of-therapy\">http://baseURL/line-of-therapy</a>\" and is a CodeableConcept.  How would I specify the path to this extension in 'dataRequirement.mustSupport',  'dataRequirement.codeFilter.path', or in '_Definition.dynamicValue.path'?</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>",
