I see that SMART does cover part of the Authorization which in most ways is similar to HEART. But the approach seems like the implementation of an authorization server would necessarily be a Acess Control Engine that incorporates security-labels of each resource, Privacy Consent Directive which also allows for User Managed Access. Is that a fairly accurate summary? Has anyone successfully used declarative policy to accomplish this in an authorization server?</p>",

In the same way that SMART is building understanding and maturity around the FHIR Data-Model and Interaction-Model; we also need an effort that builds understanding and maturity around the Security-Model to be applied to FHIR. Similar to how SMART takes a sub-set of the whole of FHIR Data-Model and focuses on it; we need a focus on a sub-set of the whole Security-Model. IN fact this is what SMART has done in that they have focused on the most essential AuthN/AuthZ. What we need is  a group that want to take the next step. The next step is not the final step, there are many steps to get to the perfect Security-Model. Is tagging next? Is consent next? Is delegation of authority next? I see activity on defining scopes, a good next step. Many steps to come.</p>",

This is not unusual for OAuth, but would be only an small step. This is not to say that one must separate them. However there would also be room for a federation of OAuth authorities to be 'in front' of that 'last' authorization server. One clear possibility is to have a federation of OAuth authorities that are just focused on the \"OpenID Connect\" profile. That is they just do user authentication and authorize the use of that identity. Thus you separate authentication out to these federation of identity providers, from the 'last' authorization server that is making authorization decisions at the resource-by-resource level. Further out (away) is an OAuth authority that 'manages' user assigned authorizations (aka delegation) thus the UMA profile on OAuth.</p>",
