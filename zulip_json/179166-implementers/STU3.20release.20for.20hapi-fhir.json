We are using the java hapi implementation. We were using last released version of hapi 2.2 from maven. Looks like the code is still not stable to validate the converted encounter-bundles. The renames are not reflected in code yet. E.g:-  In STU3 Encounter resource the <code>Encounter.patient</code> is renamed to <code>Encounter.subject</code> but <code>Encounter.java</code>was still talking about <code>encounter.getPatient()</code>. </p>\n<p>We thought of upgrading to 2.4-SNAPSHOT and we got few other errors. To proceed with our upgrade we wanted to know when we can get a stable build? Can you please let us know about your roadmap?</p>",
