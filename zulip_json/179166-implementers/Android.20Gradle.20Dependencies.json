Everything I try causes the project to no longer build successfully. I have a different project that runs on my PC in a different IDE where everything was set up for me and that works. I've tried copying the dependencies, converting it from maven format to gradle (ca.uhn.hapi.fhir:hapi-fhir-structures-r4:5.1.0). That didn't work. In the HAPI FHIR Client page, Chapter 13 is on the android client. It says to add these lines to the dependencies: </p>\n<p>compile \"ca.uhn.hapi.fhir:hapi-fhir-android:3.1.0-SNAPSHOT\"<br>\ncompile \"ca.uhn.hapi.fhir:hapi-fhir-structures-dstu2:3.1.0-SNAPSHOT\" <br>\n(I know the versions here are a bit outdated, that's just what's in the documentation, I'm trying the most recent version)</p>\n<p>Apparently 'compile' has been deprecated and Android Studio recommends I use 'implementation' instead. That doesn't work either though. <br>\nThere are a couple sample android projects linked in the documentation too. I've tried downloading and referencing both, and neither builds properly to begin with</p>\n<p>How can I get this to work?</p>",
