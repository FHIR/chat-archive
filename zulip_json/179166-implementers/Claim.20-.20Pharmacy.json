I have given the context of my request, as below.</p>\n<p>In Pharmacy Domain, Prescription holds the Prescribed Drug and Fill (or a Refill) holds information about Dispensed Drug. <br>\nIn most scenarios, the actual Dispensed Drug matches to the Prescribed Drug. However, for certain valid scenarios  Pharmacy may choose to dispense a different drug to that of a Prescribed Drug. </p>\n<p>When it comes to Pharmacy tracking corresponding Claim submission and response, it is done against a Dispensed Drug rather than Prescribed Drug.</p>\n<p>FHIR Resource Claim has following elements, which helps to represent a given Prescription:<br>\n- prescription<br>\n- originalPrescription</p>\n<p>Both elements refer to MedicationRequest for Release 3 STU and MedicationOrder for DSTU2.</p>\n<p>However, there appears to be no element to map MedicationDispense to represent Fill or Refill(s).</p>\n<p>ClaimResponse FHIR Resource, understandably, matches to the Claim that is submitted and has elements to map the adjudication and payment details.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>",
