It's a somewhat cumbersome approach, but it's 'standard' and will give you much more interoperability. </p>\n<p>You're certainly free to break from the FHIR standard if you choose to, but we won't be able to give you guidance as to \"how\" because the answer is essentially \"however you like\" - because you're now outside the standard.
