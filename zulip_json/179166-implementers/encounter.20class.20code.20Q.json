That means that if you're dealing with an outpatient dental encounter, you must use the code AMB (for ambulatory).  Encounter.class isn't intended to cover the discipline associated with the encounter - that's something that should live in Encounter.serviceType.  There, you're allowed to use whatever code system you like - though there are a couple of example codes that cover the dental domain.</p>",
