Any action is <em>always</em> tied to a specific role (Patient, PractitionerRole/Practitioner, RelatedPerson).  Person is just used for shared demographics and linking across roles for the limited set of systems that actually perform such linking.  This behavior is driven by a few things.   1.

If this registry is just a person registry without regard to healthcare, specifically patient or practitioner; then I would say that using FHIR is inappropriate. Use a more generic IT standard for more generic use-cases; FHIR is designed to support healthcare. Once we focus on the use-cases that are healthcare, then as Lloyd has pointed out, there is a need to understand the role the person has in the healthcare stage. The Person resource may seem generic, but it is specifically designed to aid with a linkage that has very specific Privacy, Business, and Security ramifications. Thus it may seem generic, but it is potentially problematic.   The exception would be where Person is used and where Person.link is forbidden. In that case then Person is rather devoid of healthcare specifics. The issue, that Lloyd is trying to express, is that the Person.link is considered fundamental to the reason the Person resource exists.</p>",

In Norway we have identified the need to serve information about citizens using a Person Master Index for healthcare, and in that use-case we are going to use HL7 FHIR to define the interfaces to this Registry. In time some healthcare specific information will be added to this registry to solve use-cases that are not of interest to organizations outside healthcare here in Norway. A lot of other information will exist on the platform, including information concerning healthcare organizations, healthcare services, and a central index of approved Practitioner, the plan is to make all this information awailable through a FHIR interface. Most of the person data will however be information from the central registry of norwegian citizens, served through a FHIR interface, we will need profiles and extensions to incorporate some of the data that exist in the common Person Master Index. </p>\n<p>I think the note describing the Person resource used in a PMI describes our thinking quite clearly: \"Note: This style of system may use the Person resource without any FHIR references to Patient or Practitioner resources.
