I set up a Web API project in C# and imported the R4 nuget package. What I'm having trouble with is figuring out where to go from there. I have watched several videos on fhir in .net and while they are informative of several key, individual features, none seem to give any detailed info on setting up a fhir project and server locally.</p>\n<p>Any advice would be highly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nDan</p>",
