He suggested I ask here. So here's what I'm trying to figure out:</p>\n<p>I'm trying to port our Anesthesia record software to using FHIR. But I'm struggling to find any sort of \"official\" way to structure the record. </p>\n<p>The final product should contain everything you'd see on a typical sedation record (which are <em>relatively</em> standardized.</p>\n<p>For a sample, see this: <a href=\"https://az184419.vo.msecnd.net/rcdso/pdf/RCDSO_4522_PC%20Sedation%20Sample%20Record_V8_Fillable_RD.pdf\">https://az184419.vo.msecnd.net/rcdso/pdf/RCDSO_4522_PC%20Sedation%20Sample%20Record_V8_Fillable_RD.pdf</a></p>\n<p>I'm trying to avoid just making up my own way to do this within FHIR if there are already established patterns for it.</p>\n<p>Currently my plan is to use a document, by creating a FHIR Composition and using the \"section\" field each with corresponding \"entry\" fields containing referenced resources like the vital signs Observations, etc.</p>\n<p>But currently, I'm just making up \"section\" titles, etc. </p>\n<p>My question is: Is there already a formalized structure for anesthesia records or even a standard set of <code>section</code> titles a sedation record should include? I would love to see some sort of \"official\" sample of what one might look like.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance, for any help.</p>",
