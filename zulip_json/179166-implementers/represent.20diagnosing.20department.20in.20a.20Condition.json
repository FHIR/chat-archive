This department is also represented as an Organization resource.<br>\nThat department in principle belongs to the condition's asserter. In theory it could be retrieved by finding the asserter's PractionerRole.organization.<br>\nBut since a practioner's role and organization can change over time - I would like to capture it along with that condition. Any suggestions?<br>\nWhat I had looked for specifically - but didn't find was that Condition.asserter could also point to the responsible organization.<br>\nThanks!</p>",
