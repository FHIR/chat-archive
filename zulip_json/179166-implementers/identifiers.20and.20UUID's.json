Naturally globally unique identifiers are those for which no system has been assigned and where the value of the identifier is reasonably expected to not be re-used. Typically, these are absolute URIs of some kind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>UUID is (v4 at least) pretty random and is expected to not be re-used.
