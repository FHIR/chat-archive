        "content": "<p>Since the release of Vonk 3.0.0-beta1, Vonk is supporting FHIR STU3 <em>and</em> FHIR R4. So there is no special Vonk build for R4. So when you are using simplifier/vonk:3.0.0-beta2 you have Vonk supporting both versions. By setting the fhirVersion in the http header you decide which version you handle. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.simplifier.net/vonk/features/multiversion.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://docs.simplifier.net/vonk/features/multiversion.html\">http://docs.simplifier.net/vonk/features/multiversion.html</a>.<br>\nThe image simplifier/vonk:stable is still referring to version 2.1.0, which is only STU3.</p>\n<p>BTW, at the end of this week (18th of October) we will release a new version of Vonk and then Vonk 3.0 will be out of beta. So keep an eye on the <a href=\"http://hub.docker.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hub.docker.com\">hub.docker.com</a> for new images..</p>",
