When a condition is no longer a problem for the patient, the Condition resource states that I may set an abatement-date or set the status to one of codes that signify that the Condition is inactive. <br>\nHowever, what to do when the Condition is no longer handled in my organisation? E.g. I send a ServiceRequest to someone else to handle the condition, and then I want to \"end it\" in my record system - not because it is better, but because I do not want it to appear as an active problem in my organisational context.<br>\nI do realize, that  it does not necessarily makes sense from a patient record perspective to \"end\" the condition, because it is actually probably still there, and at least, the last version was correct at the time of registration. My problem is that I don't have a way to distinguish \"problems that my organisation is responsible for\" from \"problems that my organisation is not responsible for (any more)\". Suggestions?<br>\nI could search for conditions that are used as \"reasons\" for my organsations active CarePlans, but I would prefer a solution that was not dependent on other resources.</p>",
