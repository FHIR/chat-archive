The more I read the more questions pop up.</p>\n<p>What I want to do:<br>\nWe have a care program with different care sections (I would use resource PlanDefinition for each care section).<br>\nThen applying the PlanDefinition for the Patient.<br>\nAn practitioner should see (e.g. in a workflow panel) which parts (ServiceRequests) of the CarePlan(?) are done and which are pending or cancelled.<br>\nIn addition part of the ServiceRequests are grouped: e.g.<br>\n Request \"record vital data\" <br>\n    |_SubRequest1 \"pulse\"<br>\n    |_SubRequest2 \"blood pressure\" </p>\n<p>Request \"do basis assessments\" <br>\n    |_SubRequest1 \"do Questionnaire 1\"<br>\n    |_SubRequest2 \"do Questionnaire 5\" </p>\n<p>When a CarePlan is initialised there should be the possibility for the Practitioner to add additional custom ServiceRequests(?).</p>\n<p>My approach:</p>\n<p>Initialising a CarePlan from a PlanDefinition with ServiceRequests referenced in <code>CarePlan.activity.reference</code>.<br>\nThe ServiceRequest hierarchy is represented by referencing the parent-Servicerequest in child-<code>ServiceRequest.basedOn</code>, because their status should be independent from parent Request and other child Requests (as statet in <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/request.html#basedon\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/request.html#basedon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/request.html#requestgroup\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/request.html#requestgroup</a>).<br>\nWhen doing an Observation/Condition/Questionnaire (event object) in context of a ServiceRequest the events reference that in <code>.basedOn</code>.<br>\nFor sake of simplicity I want to avoid using the Task resource.</p>\n<p>The problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"User-visible\" information about an action is just present in the Resources PlanDefinition and RequestGroup (description, title, prefix...), so CarePlan seems not to be the right option to display the care program to the user, and it seems this is the same case for ServiceRequest (the only field that really describes it, is <code>.code.display</code>)</li>\n<li>CarePlan cannot represent the action hierarchy in contrast to PlanDefinition and RequestGroup. But RequestGroup seems not to be the right Resource to use, because it is stated that</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"[RequestGroup] represent a group of optional activities\" and \"The RequestGroup and all of its referenced \"option\" Requests are treated as a single integrated Request whose status is the status of the RequestGroup. If there is a need to manage statuses of the different parts, separately, refer to the guidance <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/request.html#compound\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/request.html#compound</a>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>If it is necessary to get the user-visible information from the PlanDefinition I may have a problem if I add custom ServiceRequests to the CarePlan after applying the PlanDefinition</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm a bit stuck at the moment modeling my use-case in the right way.</p>",
