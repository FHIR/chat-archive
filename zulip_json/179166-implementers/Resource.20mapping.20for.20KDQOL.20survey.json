This survey should be periodically taken by the patient (once in a year).<br>\n  QuestionnaireResponse seems to be an appropriate resource for this survey.<br>\n  But the survey could be denied or there could be an exclusion provided by the patient from taking the survey for the below reason.<br>\n1) Patients under age 18<br>\n2) Those who cannot complete a KDQOL-36 due to cognitive impairment, dementia, active psychosis<br>\n3) Non-English speakers/readers (for whom there is no native language translation or interpreter)<br>\n4) Patients under the facilityâ€™s care for less than 3 months<br>\n5) Patients who refuse to complete the KDQOL-36<br>\nIf the patient chooses to get excluded or denies taking the survey, one of the above reason should be chosen.</p>\n<p>We wanted input from the FHIR experts on the apprpriate resource that can be used to map the KDQOL survey and which field will be suitable to hold the refusal/exclusion status and the reason.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nManju</p>",

        "content": "<p>So you've got a standing \"request\" and you'll either have a fulfilling questionnaire resposne or a record indicating why there isn't a questionnaire response.  For some event resources (Immunization, Procedure), we have the ability to indicate that something wasn't done and why.  For a questionnaire, you could use Observation, though we don't have a \"core\" way of explaining why the observation wasn't done.  You might submit a change request for that.  Another possibility is to use Task.  That's more of a workflow mechanism where you can indicate the state of progress of a request, including that a decision was made to not act and why</p>",
