Every time I do a read, I get a timeout exception, even with the most stripped down code like this:<br>\ntry<br>\n            {<br>\n                var client = new FhirClient(\"<a href=\"http://vonk.fire.ly\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://vonk.fire.ly\">http://vonk.fire.ly</a>\", true);               <br>\n                var pat_A = client.Read&lt;Patient&gt;(\"Patient/1\");<br>\n            }<br>\n            catch(Exception e)<br>\n            {<br>\n                Console.WriteLine(e.Message);<br>\n            } <br>\nHowever, when I do a GET with Postman, I get a successful response in 120 ms with GET <a href=\"http://vonk.fire.ly/Patient/1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://vonk.fire.ly/Patient/1\">http://vonk.fire.ly/Patient/1</a>. I get the same thing with the wildfhir server (among others), so it's not a vonk issue. Given I'm such a newby, it's likely I'm missing something fundamental, but can't figure out what it is.</p>",

Perhaps this is an incompatibility with Xamarin.Forms. Does anyone know if FHIR.NET has been tested against Xamarin.Forms? Xamarin hasn't been mentioned here since 2017, so I expect it's not a widely used platform among implementers.  It's disappointing, but for now I'll switch to coding my own REST client.</p>",

Unfortunately, anything that causes me to explore the original source code for issues is a showstopper as far as using FHIR.NET at this point. Hopefully, I'll have flexibility to do this sometime later in February.</p>\n<p>Also, I tried the same thing in a Blazor project using .NET Core 3.1 with the same result.
