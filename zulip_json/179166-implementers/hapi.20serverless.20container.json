Using the hapi-fhir-jpastarter I usually measure a \"cold-start\" delay of about 18-20s using the <code>jetty:9.4.30-jre11-slim</code> image before the server can handle requests. But it might be configured and optimized for this: disable any background (export) jobs and the scheduler initialization, use an embedded app server, maybe try building a native image on GraalVM...</p>",
