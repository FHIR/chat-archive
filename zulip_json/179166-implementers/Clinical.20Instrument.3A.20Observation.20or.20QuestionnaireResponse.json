B is ambiguous. Can we clarify which resource is better or should be more conventional?</p>",

Typically I'd expect APGAR or Glasgow to just be captured as Observations.  There's no need to have tight control over the phrasing of the questions or the order in which the components are captured.  If you did use a QuestionnaireResponse, you'd still want to extract that information into an Observation for subsequent use.</p>",
