We are implementing CARIN's profiles and are creating c4bb EOB resources (Inpatient so far) based on this structure definition &gt; <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/StructureDefinition-C4BB-ExplanationOfBenefit-Inpatient-Institutional.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/StructureDefinition-C4BB-ExplanationOfBenefit-Inpatient-Institutional.html</a> .<br>\nBasically, it's a webservice that responds with this EOB inpatient resource on a <em>get</em>.<br>\nWe are trying to find a validator for this resource. We have tried the fhir's java validator but it throws errors on the system urls because most of the terminology urls are c4bb and not hl7. We also created our own terminology pages on our server and will be utilizing those but it's the same thing - errors like 'Unknown code' or 'None of the codings match'. <br>\nI read about AEGIS Touchstone on one of the topics here and will explore that. Any help or pointers on this is appreciated. Thank you!</p>",
