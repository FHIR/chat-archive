Note that as of HAPI FHIR 1.2, DSTU2 validation files are kept in a separate JAR (hapi-fhir-validation-resources-XXX.jar) which must be added to your classpath.<br>\nHere are the maven dependencies:<br>\nhapi-fhir-base: 2.4<br>\nhapi-fhir-structures-dstu: 2.4<br>\nhapi-fhir-structures-dstu2: 2.4<br>\nphloc-schematron: 2.7.1<br>\nphloc-commons: 4.4.6<br>\nhapi-fhir-structures-hl7org-dstu2: 2.4<br>\nhapi-fhir-validation-resources-dstu2: 2.4<br>\nI debugged and noticed that the fhir-single.xsd file is searched for inside the org/hl7/fhir/instance/model/schema . But this path is not correct for version 2.4. It is correct only for version 1.1.<br>\nOn the other hand when using the 1.1 version we can't see the FhirInstanceValidator constructor which has the package visibility and not the public one.<br>\nDo you know which version should I use to be able to find the xsd schemas and the FhirInstanceValidator constructor ?<br>\nThanks</p>",
