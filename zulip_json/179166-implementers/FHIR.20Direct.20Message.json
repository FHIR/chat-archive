As <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191404\">@John Moehrke</span> states, the correct <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#mime-type\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#mime-type\">MIME type</a> should be used to tag the FHIR content, e.g. application/fhir+json, etc. Variations on this theme have been tested successfully at various FHIR connecathons, e.g. the <a href=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201901_Direct/Certificates_Track\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201901_Direct/Certificates_Track\">Direct/Certificates track</a>. For identifying workflows or more complex FHIR transactions, the <a href=\"http://wiki.directproject.org/Implementation_Guide_for_Expressing_Context_in_Direct_Messaging\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wiki.directproject.org/Implementation_Guide_for_Expressing_Context_in_Direct_Messaging\">IG for Expressing Context in Direct Messages</a> may also be of interest. I can <br>\n try to dig up a link from a 2018 webinar on this topic or some related HIMSS whitepapers, too, if there is interest. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196882\">@Kesara Liyanage</span>, are there additional questions or a specific use case you are trying to solve?</p>",
