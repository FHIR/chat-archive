How would this be represented in DSTU2.  </p>\n<p>We have looked at adding a team extension using the group resource.</p>\n<p>There is also a care team in the reference from Encounter to EpisodeOfCare.</p>\n<p>It is also noted in DSTU3 there is a CareTeam resource.  But for now we are working with DSTU2 until tooling is avialable to support DSTU3 (particularly from Furore).</p>\n<p>What is the best practice in this case?</p>\n<p>Look forward to your thoughts and guidance.<br>\nWill Jones</p>",
