So there is no way to validate an existing resource instance? HAPI seems to be validating the current resource content when the mode is unspecified and the behavior is different from explicitly specifying the mode as delete. I couldn't test with Grahame's test server at <a href=\"http://test.fhir.org/r3\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://test.fhir.org/r3\">http://test.fhir.org/r3</a> as it returns an OO for any validation.</p>",
