We have a few interpretations of what Clinical Note really is and means. Is clinical note a 'type' if you will that when a user opens a patient chart they can query for all progress notes? Procedure notes? AND within those clinical notes (documents) we must be able to send any free text or narrative for different sections, such as meds, allergies, something the provider wants to notate in ROS that is not in a structured format ?  OR is it where we (as developers) have to say okay, if a provider types narrative in the Assessment area and the Plan area, that has to be assigned to Consult Note and can not be associated to anything else?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Interesting thread.  Looking at the 5 categories of 'Clinical Notes' in USCDI - the definition of  Consultation Note (ie, 'Contains the response to request from a clinician for an opinion or advice from another clinician.') is different from that used here in NZ where, in primary care at least, it relates to the notes made by a clinician during a consultation that may lead to a diagnosis and treatment plans. Typically, it might include SOAP notes and will be available on patient portals if a clinician consents to the Open Notes approach, as well as passed in GP2GP when patient records are transferred to a new practice.</p>\n<p>This issue may extend beyond USCDI if that is aligned to the IPS and Clinical Notes are added to the later. We've also had discussions with primary care clinicians about whether Consultation Notes should go in a patient summary and the general feeling is that they shouldn't - particularly after we've shown them practical examples of some of the format conversion issues that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191764\">@Cooper Thompson</span> refers to.</p>",

The only reason we are trying to go down the notes route is to attain Cures Certification.  Bottom line is that FHIR says \"send whatever you have\" and the regulation says \"send your text\".  You are saying; if we don't have text to send, then we don't send text (and I believe  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191356\">@Jenni Syed</span> was making that point as well).   I suppose I have to take this issue up with ONC and explain that our clinical notes don't live in our system as plain text.  I appreciate all of your responses to help me gain clarity on this issue.  Thank you so much!<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191364\">@Peter Jordan</span>  I have looked at the definition of the each of the clinical notes and have come up with similar questions.  The Laboratory Report Narrative is confusing.  Does the narrative come from the lab?  Or is it expected that the ordering provider always writes a paragraph or two about the results once they are received?  Our providers can enter comments associated with a set of results but it wouldn't make sense to send the comments without the discrete data.  Including the lab data as plain text in the Laboratory Report Narrative would require the reader to spend a lot of time deciphering the content.   The requirement for \"plain text\" sounds so simple but it is creating some BIG challenges for me:(</p>",

If you allow comments that pertain to specific components results, you'd have to figure that out, but typically I expect any narratives would be against the overall test (DxRpt).</p>",
