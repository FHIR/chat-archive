After much reading and testing I figured out that bundle type \"transaction' when posted to the root, ensures that the server processes each resource individually. However, I wanted to confirm whether the other bundle types like messageHeader are supposed to be processed in a way that each resource is processed individually as a default function. Or one has to do some customizations or create specific operations. Bottomline does it happen out of box or you need to customize for other bundle type resources. Thank you.</p>",
