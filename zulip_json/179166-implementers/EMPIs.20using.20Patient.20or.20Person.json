I've provided my arguments for why it should be Patient.  There is a line in the Patient resource that I think is muddying the waters: \"The primary use case for the Person resource is to be able to support person registries that do not necessarily have a healthcare context\". Even though the main purpose of this registry is for persons receiving health care, they will be sharing the person details with other industries.  I've been asked to see which resource other EMPI systems have been using - Person or Patient?</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191367\">@Brian Postlethwaite</span> if you can help my argument (or tell me that I'm wrong), that would be great as well.</p>",

For smaller children, their parents will be handling their accounts, but for teens, they will be able to login as themselves, although their parents may still have access to some of their data. Some parents may also have more than one child. My thought was to use the Person resource to link to an account in our system. It would go something like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Child/Teen represented as a Patient resource</li>\n<li>Parent of child/teen - RelatedPerson resource (information would be duplicated as part of contact in Patient resource). If the Parent had more than one child, we would create a RelatedPerson resource for each child.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Person Resources <br>\nIf a Person was the child/teen, it would link ONLY to the Patient resource.<br>\nIf the Person was a parent, it would link to all of the RelatedPerson resources that represented the parent, to allow us to show that this Person is the RelatedPerson for a number of Patients.</p>\n<p>Would this be the proper usage?</p>",
