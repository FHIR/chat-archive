I'm trying to implement base64 images as part of Questionnaire answerOptions.<br>\nI'm thinking on adding an extension somehow to this structure:<br>\n\"answerOption\": [<br>\n    {<br>\n      \"valueCoding\": {<br>\n        \"code\": \"62855\",<br>\n        \"display\": \"0\"<br>\n      }<br>\n    },<br>\n    {<br>\n      \"valueCoding\": {<br>\n        \"code\": \"62858\",<br>\n        \"display\": \"1-3\"<br>\n      }<br>\n    }<br>\n  ]<br>\nAnybody had something similar?</p>",
