And each of these accesses  may be in different stages like, ready to use, Maturing, infected, blocked &amp; terminated. All our clinics need to track this information which is a combination of Patient, Bodysite &amp; device. The Patient may get his Vasuclar access process done outside our clinic administration(3rd party helathcare) which would mean that it is not possible for us to get the Procedure associated with it recorded in our EHR. So, we are using the DeviceUseStatement as means to record all his(patient) access types which is a critical information that feeds into our dialysis process.</p>",
