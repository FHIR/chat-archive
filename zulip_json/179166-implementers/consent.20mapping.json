The business workflow we need to support is as follows:  In our EHR, a Siemens/Cerner platform, the Clinician will enter an Assessment capturing consent data from the Patient.  That will trigger a data flow into a HAPI FHIR server, and the Assessment will be converted to Questionnaire Response.  The Questionnaire Response will trigger the creating of a Consent Resource also.  The auther of the Questionnaire Response is the person we want to track in the Consent.  I suppose we could capture the Questionnaire Response in the Consent.source and the Clinician who created entered the Assessement in Soarian/Cerner will be QuestionnaireResponse.Author.<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192782\">@Manju Sampath</span> , it looks like we can go ahead with the above path.</p>",
