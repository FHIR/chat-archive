The best approach is to change the resource in a way that it don't really fly as well for the overlapping use-cases. This might be difficult in some cases because of the requirements of theuse-cases you try to solve. I believe the best bet when you have overlapping Resource capabilities is to have good documentation that clearly states the boundaries and purpose of the resources, and I think this can get better as more implementations reveals overlaps in the spec, if the clarifications are documented that is.</p>",
