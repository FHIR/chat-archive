If I use [base]/Patient?_list=f1ce6447-820d-4176-bcea-62fb39daff44 I get a list of all patients instead of  the patients in the list. <br>\nI like to make a subscription for all appointments where the actor \"patient\" is in the list. (I thought about a subscription criteria like \"Appointment?patient:_list=f1ce6447-820d-4176-bcea-62fb39daff44\")<br>\nHas anybody an idea how I can express this in another way?<br>\nThanks for your ideas</p>\n<p>Michael</p>",
