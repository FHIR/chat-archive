Make sure to enable the configuration setting \"Show common resource elements\" in the options menu.<br>\n2. Create or load a profile<br>\n3. Slice the .contained element<br>\n4. Select the first named slice<br>\n5. Constrain the element type from Resource to e.g. Observation<br>\n6. Forge will dynamically expand the child elements of the slice, depending on the type constraint<br>\n7. Constraint the child elements of the named slice.</p>",
