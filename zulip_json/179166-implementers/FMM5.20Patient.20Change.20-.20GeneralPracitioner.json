Currently, CareTeam.participant.member can reference a Practitioner and CareTeam.participant.onBehalfOf can reference an Organization, but the tracker asked for CareTeam.participant.member to also support referencing a PractitionerRole (to get telecom, available times etc.).  The debate within Patient Care is what impact the addition of PractitionerRole should (or shouldn't) have on the onBehalfOf element.  The tracker outlines the specific pros and cons voiced.  Patient Care is looking for implementer feedback on this topic.  For example, is it confusing to reference the PractitionerRole resource when the actual role (PractitionerRole.code) is unknown?</p>",
