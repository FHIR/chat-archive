As you mentioned the question is how you handle CDA markup, e.g. the java reference implementation converts it to xhtml. you can find the logical model here: <a href=\"https://github.com/hl7/cda-core-2.0\">https://github.com/hl7/cda-core-2.0</a>. To convert from the Logical Model to FHIR you could then use the FHIR Mapping Language. If you are participating at the FHIR Connectathon there is also a track for that.</p>",
