There are some limitations: spartan reference widgets (without any except type/display/id), codes not loads their value sets and shown as strings, limited extensions support, etc. But I hope I'l fix some of them in a time. Fhir servers are differs from each other, so it may be not so simple to create an universal solution.<br>\nAlso there is not any documentation or user manual for now, I'l make it if it would be needed. But I hope all is simple. On graph view page vertices are draggable, theirs names in list and on chart are clickable (context menu for add/remove).<br>\nSo, welcome to try and I'l glad to read a feedback! :)</p>",
