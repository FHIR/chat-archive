Swagger isn't really set up to deal with that</li>\n<li>FHIR IGs are set up to ensure mandatory information is available both on-screen and for downloads.  E.g. showing version, publisher, copyright, etc. on every page, creating a 'package' file for use with FHIR validation and subsequent publication, etc.</li>\n</ul>",
