Does the existing tooling support building such packages?<br>\nFrom what I understand, in the case of the vital signs profile, this is when then a profile (e.g. BMI) must conform to two sets of profiles:<br>\n1) the parent profile - it. must conform to all the criteria of the vital signs profile<br>\n2) a specific profile - it must also conform to additional constraints as part of the BMI profile specifically<br>\nDoes this differ from just building these profiles independently but still authoring it such that the profile has both sets of constraints?<br>\nThanks in advance.</p>",

If you update the parent profile, those changes will automatically ripple down into the chlidren.   (Note that profile dependency is independent from profile packaging - packaging is purely a question of how you want to publish things.</p>",
