I tried a few of the other LOINC codes without any luck.  Where can I find the smoking frequency?</p>\n<p>Similarly, I need the alcohol status and intake which I haven't been able to track down.  So far I have tried searching for Observations with LOINC codes 74205-6, 11331-6 among others.  Where can I find this information?</p>\n<p>FYI, I am working in a test Epic instance and have confirmed that the test patient had this data populated.  I also tried searching for Observations with category=social-history and that only returns the smoking history Observation resource.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
