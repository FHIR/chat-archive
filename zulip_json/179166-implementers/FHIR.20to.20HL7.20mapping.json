We set the referenced (from Patient) Encounter.status property to 'in-progress' as a way to indicate it's an active encounter.  We use the PID (usually MRN) as the business identifier for the patient so that later on, when we send a Bundle for the A08, it can update the same Patient resource.    The A08 would also be mapped to a bundle with Patient, Encounter, etc. but the request.method set to \"PUT\" to allow the existing Patient resource to be updated.   (It depends on your A08 workflow but if the A08 also changes the patient location, e.g. in PV1, you might need to update the referenced Location and maybe Encounter resources.)    As usual though, one person's HL7 V2 mapping is just that, one person's mapping; your needs/requirements may vary (but hope this gives you an idea on one approach).</p>",
