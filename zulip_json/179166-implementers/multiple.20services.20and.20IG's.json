The case is the following: I have an IG with some 20 profiles and some 50 extensions in a setup with 10 services. Each service is responsible for its own set of profiles and has distinct ownership on the resources in the setup - eg. a patient service \"owning\" the Patient profile and eg. Communication profile and a organization service \"owning\" the Practitioner and Organization profile (the real deal can be found at <a href=\"https://docs.ehealth.sundhed.dk/latest/ig/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.ehealth.sundhed.dk/latest/ig/index.html\">https://docs.ehealth.sundhed.dk/latest/ig/index.html</a> in \"Capability Statements). As a  matter of optimization (especially during startup of the services during our CD/CI pipeline and also as a step in the development where changes to profiles belonging to other services than one self should not pose any impact) I'm about to look for something in the StructureDef that can be used to \"flag\" that a certain profile / extension \"belongs\"/\"has a primary usage\" at a specified service. Has anyone else done something like this and would they be willing to share some info to how they did it?</p>",
