We were leveraging the information in \"Devices on FHIR - Point-of-Care Device General Implementation Guide\" (<a href=\"https://simplifier.net/guide/DevicesonFHIR-Point-of-CareDeviceGeneralImplementationGuide/Home\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://simplifier.net/guide/DevicesonFHIR-Point-of-CareDeviceGeneralImplementationGuide/Home\">https://simplifier.net/guide/DevicesonFHIR-Point-of-CareDeviceGeneralImplementationGuide/Home</a>) to represent vitals coming from a patient monitoring device. This guide mapped the FHIR resources, Device, DeviceComponent and DeviceMetric to the IEEE device model that consists of Medical Device System (MDS), Virutal Medical Device (VMD), Channel and Metric. The IEEE device model components mapping to DeviceComponent can be found at <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/guide/DevicesonFHIR-Point-of-CareDeviceGeneralImplementationGuide/DeviceComponentProfiles\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://simplifier.net/guide/DevicesonFHIR-Point-of-CareDeviceGeneralImplementationGuide/DeviceComponentProfiles\">https://simplifier.net/guide/DevicesonFHIR-Point-of-CareDeviceGeneralImplementationGuide/DeviceComponentProfiles</a>. I would like to understand what was the reason for removal of DeviceComponent resource and are there any efforts to map the FHIR resources to the IEEE device model? Any insights on this topic would be very valuable to me. Thanks!</p>",

I can give more detail if you want, but basically in R4 the DeviceComponent resource's capabilities got refactored into an enhanced Device resource. DeviceComponent's main design goal was to allow nesting of components of composite devices. The changes in Device allow this to be done with Device. To get the thinking behind this, look at the detailed differences between Device in R3 and R4.@<strong>Sathish Tiptur</strong> @<strong>MichelRutten</strong> That's pretty much the case.
