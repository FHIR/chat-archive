        "content": "<p>Hi Michael, I think that anyone will struggle to provide a coherent Value Set for this in SNOMED CT - certainly without using post-coordinated concepts.  |42745003 Serious| is a quantifier - but, in reality, just an adjective and the ontology doesn't attempt to classify degrees of seriousness.  I am assuming that you are interested in adverse events, rather than adverse reactions - but I know that you're involved in the NZ COVID-19 vaccination project where adverse reactions will be an important consideration.</p>",

I'm trying to avoid post-coordination where possible to limit potential issues surrounding the data model.<br>\nIf it doesn't exist, I might avoid trying to force 'near enough' codes and use the FHIR valueset that exists.<br>\nThanks again</p>",
