        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191329\">@Aleksandra Pavlyshina</span> - There's no particular naming standard for extensions.  Good practice is for the URL to resolve to a human-readable (and ideally a computable) definition of the extension (based on the HTTP Accept header).  And good practice is also for the name to be descriptive.  The extension URL obviously needs to be unique.  For HL7-defined extensions, we typically start resource-specific extensions with the resource name so they all group together.  Beyond that, name as you see fit.  In terms of SCT codes, I'm not sure.  They all sound to me like codes for something that has happened rather than something that's desired to  happen.  However, I'll let those more familiar with the deep workings of SNOMED provide their opinions</p>",
