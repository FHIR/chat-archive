The current list of types contains some units but they are very specific and we don't have that level of detail in our system. Any thoughts on using Hospital Unit for this purpose? Keep in mind that these units are in post acute care facilities. The other option we were thinking of using was to add a Post Acute Care Unit to the list. Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>",
