The original child elements of a sliced element are hidden in the treeview. The UI clearly expresses the relationship between the sliced element and the associated slices, however it also prevents the user from constraining the original child elements.<br>\nIf the spec indeed allows this, then Forge should support it too. However I'm afraid that displaying both the original child elements as well slices will clutter the UI and is likely to confuse the user. Alternatively, displaying slices as following siblings (like they are defined in StructureDefinition) would require quite invasive and time-consuming changes in the application, and frankly that is not a feasible option at the moment. Some kind of toggle button that controls the visibility of the original child nodes might work, but I'm not fully convinced. I'll add an issue to our tracker and ponder on the UI.</p>",

I have done a slice on Provenance.reason and I need some advise:<br>\nThe case is as follows: <br>\nWe want to use two different ValueSets in Provenance.reason (Provenance.reason is a CodableConcept). </p>\n<p>One ValueSet contains \"reasons for nullification\" and should be used if the Provenance.activity is some variant of \"nullification\" of the resource the Provenance is targeting . The other ValueSet contains \"reasons for change\" should be used if the Provenance.activity is a revision of the targeting resource.<br>\nOne of the ValueSets contain codes from more than one CodeSystem.<br>\nTo be able to provide different ValueSets for for different scenarios I need to do a slice, right? (Or is there some other pattern?)<br>\nNow to may main concern:<br>\nWhat should I do with the \"discriminator\" for the slice? Do you think that we should provide a discriminator for a scenario like the one described above? <br>\nIf we should provide a discriminator, what should it be? One idea is to use  the coding.system attribute, but what should I enter here in that case? The ValueSet URI? Then, aren't we misusing the \"coding.system\"? Any other suggestions?<br>\nThanks!</p>",

If you want to define different rules for an element for a different circumstance, you either need to define distinct profiles (one profile per condition) or define an invariant that makes the assertion of the value set binding contingent on the value of another element.</p>",
