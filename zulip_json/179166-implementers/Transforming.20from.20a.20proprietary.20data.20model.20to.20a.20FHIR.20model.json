One thing I'm come across is the FHIR mapping language (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/mapping-language.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/mapping-language.html</a>). Is the mapping language spec only intended to transform data from one version of FHIR to another, or does my use-case also fit the intended use-case of the mapping language spec?  Have others' implemented this spec in a production system? I see there is a mapping engine available in Java. Thanks.</p>",
