Are there any existing Condition category codes we should use? Or should we just make up our own? We didn't find any categories that seemed to indicated Past Medical History. Thanks.</p>\n<p>(David's comment) well the binding is example strength so you can use what you want to - thought whether this is the best property for indicating PMH is debatable - would clinicalStatus be an alternative option for something that is no longer active? Might be a good question for the implementers list...</p>",
