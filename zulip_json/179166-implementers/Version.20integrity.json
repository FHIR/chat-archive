What it means is that an external system has control not only over your 'primary keys' but your internal versioning mechanism.  Every time you update a resource, the version changes - that's true regardless of what profile it's valid against, and it's possible the prior version is valid against a profile and the new version is not or vice versa.  If you're allowing an external system to control that, that's an internal design consideration and is going to be independent of what profiles or IGs you're compliant with.</p>",
