There are also observations about the various tumors (which are literally observations about a specific tumor, not observations about a body site).

I was looking at the RECIST criteria  recently and ClinicalImpression came to mind above all other clinical resources. But I felt like the 'prognosis' attribute didn't really fit what was being done. It's not a prognosis I want but an overall interpretation of these observations.  I wondered why this element wasn't called \"impression\". </p>\n<p>My representation of disease progression is an Observation, referencing the disease with event-reasonReference, and using the valueCodeable field to hold the 'CR/PR/SD'  response values. Not an ideal representation.</p>\n<p>'Safety and effectiveness of a particular drug of treatment' I found tricky in two ways. One in the 'did happen' sense, the other in the 'what will happen' sense. On the did-happen side was \"Endocrine refractory status of disease\" following a particular treatment regimen. Again I used Observation with a code like 'drug resistance status' and a value of 'hormone resistant/responsive cancer'. Is this an observation? Again it feels like a clinical judgement call. </p>\n<p>In the what-will-happen side, the most common one is 'tumor operability' or 'definitive therapy possible'.  Again, we're using Observation but it didn't quite feel right. What resource would best represent a surgeon's presurgical evaluation in which the surgeon says \"I think I will be able to excise this thing via this operation'? My issue with ClinicalImpression here is that technically the surgery request resource wouldn't exist yet, so I can't encode the type of procedure that the impression would be about (ie lumpectomy). (if the request existed, I could reference it with action)</p>",
