If not, then it marks the resources for creation.</p>\n<p>All my resources, in the bundle,  use PUT method and use its own ID (logical identifier).<br>\nHad gone thru the Google Group as well, and it was suggested to use READ_UNCOMMITTED isolation level. Just wondering if any other way out exists?</p>\n<p>Any help/suggestions/feedback.</p>",
