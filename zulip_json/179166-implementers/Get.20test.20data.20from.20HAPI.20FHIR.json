I was wondering if it's possible to make GET request for more samples or just samples with much more data, maybe ones that have Contained element also?</p>\n<p>Appreciate any help and info.<br>\nThank you,<br>\nVlad</p>",

I'm not sure if HAPI supports this or not, best to ask HAPI-specific questions in the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179167\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179167-hapi\">#hapi</a> stream.<br>\nThere is also \"bulk export\", which can be used to export a whole FHIR-server's worth of data; again not sure if HAPI supports this and this probably wouldn't be a good idea to attempt on the public HAPI server anyway.</p>\n<p>If you are really looking for test FHIR data that is 'clinically correct' you might want to instead look at Synthea.<br>\n<a href=\"https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/\">https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/</a></p>",
