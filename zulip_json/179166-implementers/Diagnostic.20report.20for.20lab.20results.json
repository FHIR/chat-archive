One report may contain a panel of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and another report may contain a subset of these and several others. The question is how to handle the codes required in DiagnosticReport and the individual Observations. For example I can use a different LOINC code for each Observation for each gene (e.g.,  57290-9 HLA-A [Type] by High resolution) but what would I put in for the code for the DiagnosticReport? It doesn't look like I can enter multiple codes, but I can't find a generic one for \"HLA typing.\" Or is it okay just to enter a display value without a code? How do I enter a post-coordinated panel of codes in DiagnosticReport?</p>",
