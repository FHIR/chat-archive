The 'transfer pack' is a paper envelope and series of reports and forms with information about the health of the resident and how they should be cared for. </p>\n<p>I haven't been able to find any examples of others implementing use cases like this. I am looking for someone to sense check how we are thinking of using FHIR, as we're pretty new to this. I've attached a diagram below.

Or would it be sufficient/ acceptable practice to capture the narrative in a section on a composition, especially where a suitable LOINC code can be used to classify it? </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At the moment, I have lots of sections (as indicated on the diagram with x 31, x2 etc)... each section only has a short text response e.g a comment on mobility, mobility aides, feeding etc)... is there any value in grouping up these sections, so there are less high-level sections? or would that just be adding unnecessary complexity? </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Regarding use of LOINC codes.. I've tried to align with the codes from the example CDA for a 'transfer summary note' (<a href=\"https://details.loinc.org/LOINC/18761-7.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://details.loinc.org/LOINC/18761-7.html\">https://details.loinc.org/LOINC/18761-7.html</a>) ...it seems like across the board there a heaps of codes that are very similar, so I thought this could be a way to limit down my options... is this a good way to go about selection of appropriate LOINC codes? or would I be better to search the full list? </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Appreciate any feedback!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/Vdts8EDjzkTfgoqXi592SHUk/FHIR-map-for-transfer-pack-v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"FHIR-map-for-transfer-pack-v2.pdf\">FHIR-map-for-transfer-pack-v2.pdf</a></p>",

For example, a narrative-only CarePlan (that presumably still populates patient, author date and author) is useful and shareable via REST, messaging, etc.  However, content sitting in Composition.section.text can't ever be retrieved on its own or passed around independently.  As a result, best practice is usually to put information into resources if there's any potential use for downstream sharing, even if it's currently mostly narrative.</p>",

The number of sections and depth of sections is really a question of preference unless you're trying to align with an IG that sets specific expectations.</p>\n<p>In terms of LOINC codes, trying to align with what's typically done in Consolidated CDA is probably your best bet for maximum interoperability.
