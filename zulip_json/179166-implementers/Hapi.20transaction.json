However, I noticed that when I post a Bundle with type transaction and it fails, resources are still persisted in the database. Is this a known bug, or some kind of configuration/resource misuse by me? I expect that if the Bundle post fails, all resources that would have posted even before the failure would not persist in the database.</p>",
