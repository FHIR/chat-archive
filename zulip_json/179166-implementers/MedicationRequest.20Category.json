But when it comes to the real needs, do we really have to have this differentiation of 4 categories?

However, that's not to say that individual use cases can't use the MedRequest.category for their own purposes, (it seems FHIR allows this since the CodeableConcept is only an Example not a required one).   So, by the same logic the CodeableConcept for \"pharmaceutical categories\" could be listed as an Example thereby not containing any implementation to use a specific coding here and any specific domain could constrain it to use a category defined in their realm (e.g. SPL in US Core).</p>",
