First post here, be gentle :)</p>\n<p>We are experiencing the same issue, in that all codes tried against <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm\">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm</a> are returning the message \"Internal Error - unknown id icd-10-cm (from crsid.asp) \" (exact message example from validator below). Googling around I have seen a few other mentions of this same issue (mostly from last year) but no resolution. Is this system expected to be fully functional at present / is the guidance on <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/icd.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/icd.html</a> still correct? Or should we be using another reference for now? If I look up the OID 2.16.840.1.113883.6.90 at <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/oid/index.cfm?ref=nav\">http://www.hl7.org/oid/index.cfm?ref=nav</a> it seems like the directory should be the one at <a href=\"https://phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/ViewCodeSystem.action?id=2.16.840.1.113883.6.90\">https://phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/ViewCodeSystem.action?id=2.16.840.1.113883.6.90</a>.</p>\n<p>ERROR: The code \"O0933\" is not valid in the system <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm\">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm</a>; The code provided (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm#O0933\">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm#O0933</a>) is not valid in the value set 'All codes known to the system' for '<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm#O0933\">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm#O0933</a>'.

They are different code systems, and we support and should have all of the codes for both - and of course they do need to be specified consistently.  I can try to check these particular codes in a little while.  If this was run earlier while the CI build was pointed to Ontoserver rather than <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a>, it is possible that the Ontoserver instance doesn't have support for ICD-10-CM (the US version).  If so you could re-run it (and delete the txcache files first, if necessary) and see if that might fix it.</p>",

I just tagged this older post (on ICD-10) as it seemed the most related to the issue at hand and figured I'd tie them together for any future inquiries along the same lines rather than starting a brand new thread. Will try re-running again after a cache clear and report back <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"392225\">@Mike Carson</span></p>",
