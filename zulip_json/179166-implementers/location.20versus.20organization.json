Is a city hospital (location) part of a state department of health (organization) but that is part of a state jurisdiction (state)? The confusion arises because of this note in <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/location.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/location.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/location.html</a>: \"Organization is intended to represent the more conceptual hierarchies, such as a ward\" then goes on to describe how jurisdictions are actually locations.</p>\n<p>Here's the quote for context:<br>\n&lt;&gt;<br>\nLocations and Organizations are very closely related resources and can often be mixed/matched/confused.<br>\nThe Location is intended to describe the more physical structures managed/operated by an organization, whereas the Organization is intended to represent the more conceptual hierarchies, such as a ward.<br>\n...<br>\nAnother use of location could be for describing a Jurisdiction. This jurisdiction may be considered a classified boundary which could be a combination of a physical boundary, and some other discriminator(s):<br>\nNation - Country wide community or Federal Government (Ministry of Health)<br>\n&lt;/&gt;</p>",

For example, some GPs are effectively one-person organisations. Looking at some of the use cases above, I would classify a hospital ward or ED as a location/facility and the hospital as a whole would be the organisation.  Telehealth also raises some interesting questions in this respect.</p>",
