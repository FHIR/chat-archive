Since this issue comes up in many quant lab tests.    I think if we want to promote a single way to this in FHIR  that it should be documented in the spec like we did for Observation.DAR.   I think should doc this nugget in the Quant datatype and even consider making it an element.  Right now  the only way to learn about Lloyd's bag of tricks is here&gt; :-)</p>",
