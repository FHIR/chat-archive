There's an extension for Questionnaire.item that lets you point to a DataElement instance.  The DataElement instance can in turn have a mapping.  SDC currently constrains the list of mapping options to SPARQL, SQL and XQuery.  However, there's some possibility we'll extend that to include CQL (ideally once they've got a mime type).  That would give you access to FluentPath.  I don't know that FluentPath lets you reference a slice though.  Doing so would require knowledge of a specific profile.</p>\n<p>PatientCare has agreed to add an extension that allows you to specify a mapping directly within a Questionnaire (as well as to include a pointer to a StructureMap which could contain such mappings).  My expectation is that SDC will constrain both to the same mapping languages as we use within DataElement.

One of my concerns with fluentpath as I understand it is that it doesn't have any capability to consider a particular profile when navigating.  So, if my profile has sliced Patient.identifier with slices for SSN and MRN, I can't use that definition in a fluentpath expression.  This is of course good in some sense since I'm not dependent on profiles for navigation, but it's a barrier to adoption of the FHIR metamodel as a reflection of our clinical data model.
