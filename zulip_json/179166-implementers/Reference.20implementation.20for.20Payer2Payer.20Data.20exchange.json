New payer provides an app (which could just be a website, I don't mean to imply a native app); the patient (or authorized representative) approves it to access data from Old payer. Every payer needs to support the supply side of this API already, so it should be a universally available option. (Downside: Patient needs to be involved. Not everyone would call this a downside though :-))</p>\n<p>That said, there's also a Da Vinci IG (PDEX?) describing a B2B flow with back-channel patient matching (<code>$patient-match</code> operation). I'm not sure there's any requirement in place to drive adoption, but someone else may have a better perspective.</p>",
