        "content": "<p>The first question is whether an observation of \"irregular pulse\" is useful or typically ever captured on its own.  If the answer is \"yes\", then the relationship between pulse rate and pulse regularity would be similar to the relationship between \"white blood cell count\" and \"hemoglobin\" - two separate observations that are often collected together in a panel.  If, on the other hand, regularity is almost never collected or interpreted on its own, then treat the two like you do systolic and diastolic blood pressure.  In this case, if you deem the pulse rate to be the \"primary\", it would be ok for it to be captured as the root value and have the regularity to be a component that qualifies it.</p>",
