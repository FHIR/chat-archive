So when hospital A in state A requesting patient clinical data from hospital B in state B, hospital B may not be able to send all medical data due to addition requirement from state B. And we do want hospital A know that some conditions are masked due to lack of consent.<br>\nSo another question is that should I mask only the Condition.code with DAR code or the whole Condition with DAR extension. Now I think maybe I should mask the whole Condition except <a href=\"http://Condition.id\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Condition.id\">Condition.id</a></p>",

Unless there are constraints or wording that say otherwise, then DAR - and any other standard or local extension can appear on any element so long as the context in the extension definition allows it.
