My gut instinct is that we need use cases and to draft out some details.  Would it be easiest to have each vendor select a test patient that the other vendors reciprocate?  Or would a neutral 3rd party defining a test patient help facilitate things?  Clinicians on FHIR might be positioned correctly to facilitate.  But do we add Bob Anyman to the vendor EHRs?  Or do we update the Clinician on FHIR usecases to use Jason/Jessica Argonaut and Alice Newman and others?</p>",
