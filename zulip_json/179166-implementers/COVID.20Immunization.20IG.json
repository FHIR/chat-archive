That's what 95% effective means. A recent observational study of thousands showed that those who had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on an initial sample had a 0.3% chance of a subsequent infection while those who did not have antibodies in the initial sample had a 3% chance of subsequent infection.  So, evidence that natural antibodies protect, but it says nothing about what level of antibody would be needed to label an individual \"immune\".  Patient is immune, I would agree would be an observation, but there is no clinically valid observation of immunity.  The only observation that is valid at this time is \"patient is vaccinated\" or \"patient had documented COVID-19\".  It is possible that a level of a particular antibody (different tests measure different antibodies) will be associated with a high probability of \"likely immunity\".
