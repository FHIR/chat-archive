Also to note, when searching on periods GT acts as an \"ends after\" while LT acts as a \"starts before\" following the same logic.<br>\nSA and EB can also be used on non-period dates and decimals where there is an implied period based on the precision and I think that's what Lloyd was referring to.<br>\nSo yes, they are different but they can be equivalent in most cases.</p>",
