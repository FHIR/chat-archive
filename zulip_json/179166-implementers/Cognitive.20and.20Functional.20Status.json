We previously included this data in STU3 Observation. Neither Observation nor Condition category value sets really accommodate this data type which has been known as impairments. This is not really the documentation of an assessment, it is more of a statement that  patient has a \"dependence on cane\".  Curious how/where others have included this type of information and whether or not Observation is the right place.</p>",
