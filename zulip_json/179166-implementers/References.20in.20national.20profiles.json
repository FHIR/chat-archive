As we are developing no-basis-profiles as the according FHIR-resources are being adopted in Norway this is a continuously moving target, and once we have approved a new one all previously no-basis-profiles referencing the new resource needs to be updated. This requires additional governance processes and resources. In practical implementations it will very often not be no-basis-profile that is referenced in the actual implementation, but one that is derived from no-basis (in the same way no-basis profiles are derived from international resources) .  <br>\nWe are discussing whether it would be easier and just as effective to just reference the international resources directly – Reference(Xyz), but we see this is not a common approach. What would be the most important drawbacks with such a solution?</p>",

The most important information in no-basis-profiles are terminology binding, identifiers, important national extensions etc. But we do see that most countries (nl, uk, us, de) who are developing base/ core profiles are using other base/core-profiles in the referencing - instead of just referencing the resource like this Reference(Organization).</p>",

As example we move from Procedure.subject.Reference(no-basis-Patient!Patient) to Procedure.subject.Reference (Patient), This is a pragmatic decision in order to reduce the maintenance burden, and we already have a number of policies and guidelines to secure that clinical implementations follow our national profiling framework including the use of FHIR base profiles. We might revisit the decision when we have developed a broader set of no-basis-profiles, have established more solid goveranance structures and see possible tool support for functionality like the global-attribute. We will also evaluate downstream practical consequences over time of not referencing the full set of no-basis-profiles for validation etc.</p>",

However, we have insufficient maintenance resources in HL7 Norway  for the moment as there are quite some pressurse on the development side. We are prioritzing development of base profiles based on actual adoption in projects, and for most new profiles we develop a number of exiting base profiles are outdataed because of not referencing the newly developed resources correctly (Reference no-basis). Out jugdment is now we will not lose too much by leaving them out for now. Will keep you updated.</p>",

In NZ, our approach to the Base IG has been to start with defining the extensions, identifiers and terminology - informed by existing implementations of FHIR and earlier standards, notably those used in National Systems.

We are only creating a single, abstract artefact and will leave it up to the derived, 'concrete' IGs used by individual services and products to impose most strict constraints.</p>",

Domain profiles are meant to excert more harmonization also in the stricter profiling - and we want to do this according to international implemenation guides if some exists and are relevant for the given domain. For example are we pointing to FHIR PHD IG and FHIR PoCG IG for personal devices and \"high-acuity\" hospital advices. And we want to be in charge of services that are being exposed so that we do not end up with american vendor following Argonaut and another vendor following IPS for example. Coming up now is national profiling on CarePlan and DiagnosticReport. Here we see the need for different national domain templates, depening on what kind of plan and what kind of DiagnosticReport.</p>",
