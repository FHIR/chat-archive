This data will be used later in the calculations that will be defined inside of Observations tied to Diagnostic Reports. However, the way they come is in batches of results that might tie to many patients but in a singular batch. We need a way of storing this data to allow it to be verified before it progresses to the calculation stage as well as for Quality Control purposes. Any ideas?</p>",
