We clarify that the clinical note text included in any of the notes described in the “Clinical Notes Guidance” section of the US Core IG adopted in § 170.215(a)(2) must be represented in a “plain text” form, and would be unacceptable for the note text to be converted to another file or format (e.g., .docx, PDF) when it is provided as part of an API response.\"</p>\n<p>Does this mean that the response for all clinical notes should not include meta data that points to a PDF or some other file format???  (That just doesn't make sense.) Or is this just a statement to say do not convert the text into a file before sending?  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.</p>",
