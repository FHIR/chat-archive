In order to be compatible with CQL engines, I need to represent several DICOM tags within a FHIR resource. I was thinking of adding custom codes (e.g. kVp, CTDIvol) to Observation. Is this a reasonable approach?</p>",

I think that is the most in-depth interaction between FHIR and DICOM that has been documented, and could likely serve as inspiration. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"277357\">@Christopher Lindop</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197037\">@Jonathan Whitby</span> are current co-chairs of the Imaging workgroup and could probably speak to other initiatives.</p>\n<p>In the past, the work group tried to clearly delineate between FHIR and HL7 content, and reduce duplication (and the potential for divergent values). I'd be hesitant to encode \"too\" much from the DICOM Dose SR into FHIR. Instead, allow a FHIR resource to point to the SR as a source of \"more\" information. </p>\n<p>All that said, yes, custom observation codes seem to make sense. I suggest not using the DICOM element tag value, since your codes won't include the full path to the element. Instead, make up codes and provide mappings from your code to DICOM elements. I suspect if this is going to go beyond a fairly closed environment, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197037\">@Jonathan Whitby</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"277357\">@Christopher Lindop</span> would like to get the WG involved.</p>",
