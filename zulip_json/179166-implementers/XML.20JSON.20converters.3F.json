I POST the XML bundle to <a href=\"http://fhirtext.uhn.ca/Bundle\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhirtext.uhn.ca/Bundle\">http://fhirtext.uhn.ca/Bundle</a>. Then GET it back in JSON. Strangely it won't accept transaction bundles, but it'll accept it if I change the type to 'bundle. Then I edit the type in the retrieved JSON back to transaction and all seems good. at least the HAPI server will process it when I POST it to the top level endpoint.</p>",
