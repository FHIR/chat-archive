In that case, if you don't have a value for one of the repetitions, you'd have 'null' in that slot for the <code>foo</code> array (and would have an object in that location in the <code>_foo</code> array).  The reverse would occur if you have a value and have no extensions or id.  That's the only time 'null' is allowed in FHIR JSON.</p>",
