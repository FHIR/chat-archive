I need to convey two versions - the version of the software that was conformance tested for this environment and the \"current\" version number (which can be newer in cases where changes have been made that in theory don't require re-certification).  I'm planning to send one using MessageHeader.sender.version and using an extension for the other.  My question is which I should put in the core element - the \"current\" version or the \"conformance\" version.  Opinions?</p>",
