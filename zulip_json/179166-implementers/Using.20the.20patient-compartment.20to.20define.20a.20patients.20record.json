The inclusion of performer seems to imply it would include data that wasn’t necessarily about that Patient, for example if they were marked as a performer on an Observation for their child.</p>\n<p>So my question is, what is the reasoning behind including Observation.performer in the patient-compartment and, more generally, is it actually sensible to use the patient-compartment to determine who a resource is about (both for authorisation purposes and more generally to decide if it is part of a patients medical record).</p>",

This would seem to align the definition of patient compartment closer with \"what the patient has authorization to\" that it is aligned with the concept of \"this is information about the patient as the subject\".   The parent / child use-case seems like a good use-case for authorization perspective;  but as you point out there is a need to get just the data where the patient is the subject (so not children or elder-care or spouse-care)</p>",

        "content": "<p>I agree. which is why I was surprised. I would have expected the patient compartment to truly be patient centric. I do think we are too focused right now on child. I wonder if the intent of indicating that patient compartment might have data that was not directly associated with the patient as leading toward resources that are medically relevant to the patient, but are not attributed to that patient.  I would expect any resource that is dual subject, would just have both subjects listed. Thus I am not sure what falls into these edge cases. Might the variation have been put there simply to deal with edge cases that are not predictable, and they had no specific examples?</p>",
