(We cant do HEART/UMA yet due to some limitations from our Authorization Server). In this regard, I would like to ask if Consent can be extended to support dynamic data definitions rather than just static references to currently existing resources. For example, Patient Alice wants to share any current and future Observations with a specific code and a certain security label to his psychiatrist only and say current and future Vital Signs observations to his PCP. <br>\nSomething like Group.characteristic can be used to compute the dynamic group membership.</p>",
