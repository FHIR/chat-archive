Do you mean, your system has problems with Conditions when they have categories? Please help me here...<br>\nYour summary is correct. Also your note that not only ProcedureRequest may be used as P but also the other resources (CarePlan, MedicationOrder, ReferralRequest, NutritionOrder...) as long as they have a reference to the corresponding encounter. If a system ist that specific, then all these resources have to be queried with the corresponding encounter as search param. In our case, the underlying system (elexis) is just switching from an unstructered encounter text to SOAP, so we did not want to put even more work on their shoulders (and we don't need it yet). If we communicate one day with a system providing other resources than ProcedureRequest as P we will extend our queries. I think that is the way, REST is working (we have to query the ressources one by one instead of receiving everything in one response).<br>\nMore than one complaint should be no problem: you can put as many conditions in the list as you wish. The graphical presentation of the complaints is up to the client. In our use case (onlinepraxis) we just write one complaint per encounter.<br>\nConcerning the problem list: the conditions exist on their own, they are normal, independent resources. So you can query them by category, patient and clinical-status and you receive all the problems/active problems... of that patient. They can also be referenced in the list from several encounters.<br>\nI'm open to critics and want to learn more, so please don't hesitate to ask and criticize our approach/suggestion to represent SOAP within FHIR.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hello Alexander<br>\nThank you for the clarification.<br>\nI've had a little discussion with the doctor in our team.<br>\nAs I understand your post, your idea is to use multiple conditions in order to separate multiple topics (problems, reasons for encounter) within the same consultation (e.g. a patients visit for his cough and also for his hurting leg). We think, in theory, the proper way of achieving this separation is by creating two (or more) encounters with links to the corresponding condition of type diagnosis (problem). This way it is very clear and the SOAP schema for formalizing an encounter is kept clean. I don't see how to achieve the same with linking from every SOAP entry to the corresponding problem (condition), the observation seems to have no usable link to the condition.<br>\nThe question is also, how the doctors work in the real world. Of course, there are exceptions but I think most of them put everything within the same encounter and within the same SOAP entries. Because the encounter (with all the corresponding SOAP entries) is linked to all the corresponding problems, the encounter always is in the result list when querying for one of these problems (searching for an encounter by providing the condition/problem).<br>\nAs I see now, the future version of the condition valueset will only contain two categories, problem-list-item and encounter-diagnosis: <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/codesystem-condition-category.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/codesystem-condition-category.html\">http://build.fhir.org/codesystem-condition-category.html</a>. This leads to changes of our solution because the condition-category « complaint » does not exist anymore. Perhaps it would be possible to extend the observation category valuest with « complaint » ?</p>",

So splitting a 10-minute Encounter into as many Encounters as there are problems just because Encounter has to group them, will not work for us in my opinion.</p>\n<p>The way GP systems work is that they have a grouping mechanism \"Episode\" for problem oriented approaches. When something is relevant under a given Episode they add a reference to the Episode to that piece of info, e.g. any combination of S/O/A/P or a specialist letter they receive.</p>\n<p>Secondly within Encounter, Dutch GP systems are able to group S/O/A/P based around problem 1 (which may or not yet correspond to an Episode) from problem 2.
