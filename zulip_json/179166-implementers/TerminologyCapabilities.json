We will certainly want to clarify the expectations around this as we create further documentation and obtain further Connectathon and implementation experience.  In regard to your specific question, my expectation is that normally the terminology capability statement would include <strong>all</strong> of the code systems and value sets that are supported by the server.  If you have more questions you may want to consider posting them on the <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179202-terminology\" title=\"#narrow/stream/179202-terminology\">terminology</a> stream.</p>",
