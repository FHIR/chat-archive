        "content": "<p>If you're talking questionnaires, the content isn't profilable - because there's no way to know what questions mean.  CommunicationRequest can be used for pretty much any purpose, so it would be hard to know what the rules are.  Even for Consent and Contract, there are so many types (and no standard terminology to represent them), profiling would be hard, plus the challenges that in both resources the 'guts' might be a referenced PDF that's completely non-computable.  I just don't think we have sufficient interoperability to define general-purpose constraints.  If you had a tight national profile with a specific scope and thus knew exactly what it was representing and how  - then you could potentially create sub-profiles that were state-specific.  (Though even then, you'd need to worry about maintenance as the rules, regulations and even case law continue to evolve.)</p>",
