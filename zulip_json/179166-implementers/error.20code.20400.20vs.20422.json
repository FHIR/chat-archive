The operation takes a Parameter resouce that contains a Patient resource, and returns a Bundle if results are found. My question is: should I use 400 if the request resource is non-conformant in any way, or should I use 422 if it only fails businss rules, and 400 for structural and valueset validation? The confusion stems from the FHIR rule that says \"<strong>422 Unprocessable Entity - the proposed resource violated applicable FHIR profiles or server business rules</strong>\", does the \"violated profile\" refer to the structure part or the semantic part? Should 422 only be used for resource create or update? Thanks.</p>",
