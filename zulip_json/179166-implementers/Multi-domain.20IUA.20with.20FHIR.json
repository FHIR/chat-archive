Given that the token may, in general, be an opaque token, how does one tell which provider to test it against to validate the bearer token and retrieve the user information?  That is, a header of:<br>\nAuthorization:               Bearer SlAV32hkKG<br>\nIf one only allows 1 authorization provider, it is trivial to authorize that, but with more than one it isn’t clear which system to pass that too.  Essentially I’m wondering how extract what user domain this bearer token is for.  Here, the user is logging into some external page, and then using the bearer tokens against a remote service, not using the authorization login page services directly.</p>",
