Even in such cases, URIs can be lengthy (in characters).</p>\n<p>Is there any way to encode a \"display\" value associated with a URI? I know that URI are defined as a Primitive Type, so maybe this question targets the Identifier Complex Type. Is there a way to specify \"what\" the Identifier.system value represents, in display/textual form? Identifier.type seems intended to designate \"Medical Record Number\" or \"Health Card Number\", but there's no way to identify that the identifier is \"MRN from St.Johns Hospital, Toronto\" or \"Ontario Health Card Number\", aside from pre-defining the expected URIs.</p>\n<p>Would welcome thoughts/ideas ,thank you!</p>",
