The purpose of the implementation is both Inventory update/Stock management and ordering from hospital pharmacy. We also aim to support dispense through Automatic dispensing machine using the same API. We have had initial discussion with Touchpoint for a POC based on the MedicationDispense. <br>\nAll dispense are dose oriented, updating the dose status in the EMR. To complicate it even further we have a system that support ordering by generic medication (substance) where the product is selected either by nurse in a medicine room or at the pharmacy. The dispense for each dose is documented in the EMR, either as part of the nurse dispensing process or by pharmacy dispense (updating from the Pharamcy ERP). We have used the 2019 version of IPS Medication definition that have slice’s based on IDMP to support all variants of medication definitions.</p>\n<p>Ordering from pharmacy would include standard medication and patient specific medication (typically cancer medication, infusion and pain relieve medication).  Defining the complex medications is extremely complex :), but achievable within the standard resource. Production/dispensing in hospital pharmacy would be automated or semi-automated in our Health region, depending on facility infrastructure.<br>\nWe have strictly limit the MedicationDispense to the process of supply medication and updating inventory. The process in the use case you mention where you administrating medication from a procedure tray, needs to be split in differnt processes. For a procedure tray, the medications are dispensed (by our definition) when the tray is ready/released for delivery at the pharmacy or is prepared in the medicine room. Administrating from a procedure tray is a separate process. There is no problem to include the procedure resourse in the dispense if you need to assosiate the dispense with a procedure. We evaluated a few use cases, but concluded to put it  out of scoop.</p>",
