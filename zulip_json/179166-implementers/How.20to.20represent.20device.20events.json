Consider a portable Insulin Pump: it may issue a stream of log events like Power-on, power-off, cartridge-low, cartridge-empty, battery-low, etc. Have been leaning toward Observations against the Device itself, with Observation.subject=Device. Is there a different appropriate resource for this sort of thing? Thoughts?</p>",

Frequently this is conveyed with sensor annumciation bytes that employ positional bit settings to indicate anhything from a \"battery is low\" to \"reading was outside sensor limits\" or outright \"device failed\". Some of these obviously map to a databsentReason, but others are conveying an operational log of device status (e.g. power-on, power-off, glucometer strip was not inserted properly, etc etc).    </p>\n<p>I am trying to separate concerns, to handle status that can be directly mapped to operational events outside of Observation values. I believe that is best handled by Observations against the device, made by the device. Obviously something other than LOINC for Observation.code.</p>",
