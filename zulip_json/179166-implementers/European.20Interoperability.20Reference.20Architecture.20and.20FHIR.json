The EIRA© provides a common terminology that can be used by people working for public administrations in various architecture and system development tasks. The EIRA© was created and is being maintained in the context of Action 2016.32 of the ISA² Programme. The EIRA uses (and extends) the ArchiMate language as a modelling notation and uses service orientation as an architectural style.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea is that a mapping to EIRA could help policy makers, architects, portfolio managers etc better see and communicate what areas of interoperability the FHIR standard addresses, and what other potentially salient areas need to be addressed elsewhere in order to achieve interoperability in a given case.</p>\n<p>Has anyone heard of anyone doing this? Do you think it's a good idea? Does it have potential to be useful?</p>",

Also split Technical into \"Applications\" and \"IT Infrastructure\", the latter being not specific for healthcare.  <br>\nSee <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/ev_20151123_co03_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/ev_20151123_co03_en.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/ev_20151123_co03_en.pdf</a><br>\nI am not aware of efforts to link this framework to more recent developments like EIRA.
