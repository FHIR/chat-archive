A state ID might be given to a person who isn't of driving age, or maybe for an elderly person who is no longer allowed to drive, or someone who needs an ID for identification purposes and never learned to drive. So is the list missing an entry for state ID, or should driver license be considered broad enough to cover?</p>",
