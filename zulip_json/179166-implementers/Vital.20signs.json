While Provenance, Observation.performer = patient, and Observation.device are all options, the biggest challenge is that the aggregator third party consumer apps don't always differentiate between patient manually entered data (least trustworthy) or device-interfaced data (better), meaning we don't know the specific provenance for each observation.

But later found the standard profile 'Vital signs' <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-vitalsigns.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-vitalsigns.html</a> and deiced to derive the profiles for body weight, body height, head circumference using that standard Vital sign profile. <br>\n Can I use the Vital sign standard profile to derive all the parameters I have mentioned above ? Are those actually vital signs ?  Or should I derive those from the Observation resource ?</p>",
