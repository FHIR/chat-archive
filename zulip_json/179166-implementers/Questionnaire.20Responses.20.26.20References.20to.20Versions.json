One concept I'm considering how to map across is questionnaires that capture observations that have a life beyond the questionnaire.</p>\n<p>It seems like the correct mapping of this that the question is answered by an observation reference to an observation. But I'd like to be some record of the observation the user thought they were using when they were completing the questionnaire, just incase that observation is subsequently modified.</p>\n<p>This would seem to call for a reference to a particular version of a resource rather than just to the resource. Is this a concept that's come up? Or am I way off base?</p>",
