If you provide a entity.reference, then don't bother populating entity.identifier. You can, there is nothing wrong with that; but it doesn't help audit analysis. entity.identifier is there for cases where the entity is not a FHIR object. Now that Reference can handle this, the model should likely change to just offering Reference. The model we have today predates the STU3 change of Reference datatype.</p>",
