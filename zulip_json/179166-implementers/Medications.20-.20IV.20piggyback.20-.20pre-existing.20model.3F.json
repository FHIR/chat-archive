A lot of medication administration data involves one medication (such as an antibiotic) diluted (in a bag of normal saline, for example) and administered through a slow IV drip. I looked for existing formalisms to model this in FHIR but couldn't find an example. Is there a standard or accepted formalism to model this in a MedicationAdministration (and possibly MedicationRequest) resource? Thought I'd ask before creating an extension. Thanks!</p>",

        "content": "<p>To give you some context, the IV pump has multiple controllers. You can set a rate for the \"solute\" (which itself is a liquid preparation, though concentrated) and the \"solvent\". (Perhaps 'concentrate' and 'diluent' would be better terms, but I digress). The IV pump will mix them at the correct dilution and infuse them. The IV pump will stop at a preset time/dose, or it can be manually stopped. It can transmit data to an EHR, and we can calculate the dose from the start time, stop time and infusion rate. I'm wondering what's the best way to model either the raw data from the IV pump or the actual dose that was administered.</p>",
