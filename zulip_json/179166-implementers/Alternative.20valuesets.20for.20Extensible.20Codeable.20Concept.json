My question is whether it's OK to use an alternative valueset for an extensible codeable concept (given the rule that if the value you want to represent is in the named valueset/system you *must* use that one). As an example, the dataAbsentReason in the Observation resource lists <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-valueabsentreason\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-valueabsentreason\">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-valueabsentreason</a> as its extensible system, so <br>\n&lt;coding&gt;<br>\n    &lt;system value=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-valueabsentreason\"/&gt;<br>\n    &lt;code value=\"not-asked\"/&gt;<br>\n    &lt;display value=\"Not Asked\"/&gt;<br>\n&lt;/coding&gt;<br>\nis valid, as its from the named value set. Would <br>\n&lt;coding&gt;<br>\n    &lt;system value=\"http://snomed.info/sct\"/&gt;<br>\n    &lt;code value=\"47492008\"/&gt;<br>\n    &lt;display value=\"Not seen\"/&gt;<br>\n&lt;/coding&gt;<br>\nalso be valid (as \"Not seen\" is not part of the named valueset/system, but in this example is a valid data absent reason)?<br>\nTo sum up, can you use a different system to the one named for an extensible codeableConcept, or must you extend the named system?</p>",
