I'm willing to contribute the code I develop to implement this back to the project. </p>\n<p>I went through docs @ <a href=\"http://docs.simplifier.net/fhirnetapi\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://docs.simplifier.net/fhirnetapi\">http://docs.simplifier.net/fhirnetapi</a>, but didn't find any details about how could I implement/enhance the profiles. Really appreciate any guidance/advice you can provide.
