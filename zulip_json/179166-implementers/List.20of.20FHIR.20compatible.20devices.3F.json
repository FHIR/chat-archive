I.E. glucose monitor, blood pressure monitor, any kind of patient monitoring device really. </p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

Same for cloud services offered by device manufacturers (which expose the data from the device uploaded by the companion app).</p>\n<p>Today, the most common scenario is that you have third party apps and services that communicate with the device directly (through USB, Zigbee, or Bluetooth, for instance) or with a cloud service of the device vendor, and then convert that data to FHIR. I've personally been involved in a few projects of this kind. I also know of other projects I haven't been involved in. Also, the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179222\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179222-finnish-PHR\">#finnish PHR</a> platform is all about having data from these personal monitoring devices available for citizens and healthcare practitioners through apps, in FHIR format.</p>",
