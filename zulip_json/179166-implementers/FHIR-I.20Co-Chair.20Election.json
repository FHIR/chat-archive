I have learned a lot of FHIR during the last six years. My FHIR-I involvement helped me to be the first to pass FHIR Proficiency Certification. Other than FHIR-I WG, I also outreached to CDS, Pharmacy, and Vocabulary Work Groups. Outside HL7 community, I have worked at both private sector and public sector. As a co-chair, I will continue current work group's agenda, and serving FHIR activities in other work groups. Thank you for voting for me.</p>",
