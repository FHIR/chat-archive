You can either use <code>162690006 | On examination - obese (finding) |</code> as <code>evidence.code</code> or reference to a BMI observation. BTW, BMI 25-30 is only overweight. So, reference to an observation will make more sense for BMI=28 patients. For us, we only use the worst pathology report as evidence. Too much information doesn't do any help.</p>",
