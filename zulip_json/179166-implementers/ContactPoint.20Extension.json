        "content": "<p>Generally, the expectation is that the extension will be included as part of the value.  Extension is really intended for when you want to break the parts of a phone number into its constituent pieces for easy validation, automated dialing, consistent rendering, etc.  (And even then, best practice is to still send the value element with a rendered version of everything.  That said, that looks mostly correct.  The '123' needs to be surrounded by quotes.</p>",
