OTOH you are also not adhering if the instruction is \"during this week, do not take\" and you still take it. <br>\nIn any case, this should be clarified. Perhaps this notion of \"adherence\" field is supposed to be a summarizing field?<br>\nIn any case, I suggest that at least the different combinations of \"taking/not taking\" and \"as instructed / not as instructed.. \" should be listed and an adherence flag indicated for those - and if this flag is not unambiguous, this element would need to be split then.</p>",

I agree that whether you are taking medication and whether this is \"as instructed\" are two separate concepts. Which is why, in our Dutch national functional models for <a href=\"https://zibs.nl/wiki/MedicationUse2-v1.1.1(2020EN)\">medication use</a>, we have indeed separated the two concepts into <a href=\"https://zibs.nl/wiki/MedicationUse2-v1.1.1(2020EN)#13448\">'asAgreedIndicator'</a> en <a href=\"https://zibs.nl/wiki/MedicationUse2-v1.1.1(2020EN)#13455\">'useIndicator'</a>.</p>",
