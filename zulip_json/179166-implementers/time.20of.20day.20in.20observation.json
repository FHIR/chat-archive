Ok so I don't need extension for this. I got confused and tried to search for the completely wrong thing.  This event timing value set got me confused because at the beginning it seemed like something I was looking for. Using component seems to be answer to most of my questions. So could it just be presented like this:<br>\n<code>\"component\": [\n    {\n        \"code\": {\n            \"coding\": [\n                {\n                    \"code\": \"272106006\",\n                    \"display\": \"Temporal periods of day (qualifier value)\",\n                    \"system\": \"http://snomed.info/sct\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"code\": \"73775008\",\n                    \"display\": \"Morning (qualifier value)\",\n                    \"system\": \"http://snomed.info/sct\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n    ]</code></p>\n<p>or does the morning, day, evening or night have to be valueCodeableConcept like this:<br>\n<code>\"component\": [\n      {\n         \"code\": {\n            \"coding\": [\n               {\n                    \"code\": \"272106006\",\n                    \"display\": \"Temporal periods of day (qualifier value)\",\n                    \"system\": \"http://snomed.info/sct\"\n               }\n            ]\n         },\n         \"valueCodeableConcept\": {\n            \"coding\": [\n               {\n                    \"code\": \"3157002\",\n                    \"display\": \"Evening (qualifier value)\",\n                    \"system\": \"http://snomed.info/sct\"\n               }\n            ]\n         }\n      }\n   ],</code></p>",

It's fine for an application to pay attention to one coding and ignore the rest - it's not used to post-coordinate.  If you want to post-coordinate, you do that all in one code.  The second could work.</p>",
