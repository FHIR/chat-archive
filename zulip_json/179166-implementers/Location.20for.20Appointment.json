The Appointment resource documentation describes this clearly like this:</p>\n<p>12.10.2.3 Appointment Locations and Participation <br>\nThe location of the appointment is to be defined by using a participant that references a Location or HealthcareService resource.<br>\nThis permits the location to also have its availability checked via a schedule and any conflicts more easily managed.</p>\n<p>When looking at <em>participant</em> it has the following elements:<br>\n<strong>type</strong>    Σ   0..*    CodeableConcept Role of participant in the appointment<br>\nParticipant type (Extensible)<br>\n<strong>actor</strong>   Σ   0..1    Reference(Patient | Practitioner | PractitionerRole | RelatedPerson | Device | HealthcareService | Location)    Person, Location/HealthcareService or Device<br>\n<strong>required</strong>    Σ   0..1    code    required | optional | information-only<br>\nParticipantRequired (Required)<br>\n<strong>status</strong> Σ   1..1    code    accepted | declined | tentative | needs-action<br>\nParticipationStatus (Required)<br>\n<strong>period</strong>      0..1    Period  Participation period of the actor</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong><br>\nThe type only seems to be valid for actors that are people, and not locations (or devices or services). How is the <em>type</em> element intended to be used for an <em>actor</em> that is a Location?</p>\n<p>Just not use it? That doesnt seem like a good option to me, as the type ideally should specify the role the actor is playing, and as we have a generic actor representation we would need to build business logic to figure out which type of actor is being provided and would want to do that based on a coded value.</p>\n<p>So maybe extend that value set with roles that are also valid for locations? But then location for the appointment seems to be such a common use case that there should be a code included in this value set already. </p>\n<p>Or have I misunderstood something about how to use Location for an Appointment? (there is a larger discussion that could be had as well about the role of the Slot  and it's HealthcareService in determining the Location for the Appointment)</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
