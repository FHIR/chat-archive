How could his doctor at Hospital B access his clinical data from Hospital A? SMART-on-FHIR in Hospital A may not be able to authenticate a doctor from different hospital. What I can think about is the Patient downloads his medical records to a thumb drive and bring it to his new doctor. Is there any protocol addressing this? Thanks</p>",
