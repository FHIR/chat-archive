Some of these appointments are marked as \"all day\" and we don't know the right way to handle them (because of the time zone issue), both as data and in UI.<br>\nWe considered two options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mark appointments with an \"all day\" extension and act accordingly in our EHR.</li>\n<li>Use the time zone of the location where the doctor is based, with the problem that if the doctor sees the appointment from another time zone it will come out incorrectly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any idea, please, thanks.</p>",

Like -1 or 999 this would be a workaround with a special value (24 * 60), because the appointment won't really take that amount of minutes. I'd be looking to see if serviceType or appointmentType could be used to indicate an \"all day appointment\"</p>",
