Basically, I have a set of 2-dimensional matrices - eg. 1,2,3,4 on one axis (describing severity) and categories on the other axis (describing eg. different traumas on the head). If I was to make this really simple, I could just profile an observation with some slices on component and deliver a set of codes containing 3 dimensional coordinates like A#B#C where 'A' would be the Id of the matrix, 'B' would be the column number and 'C' would be the row number. I like the simplicity of this design, but it does not really seem to take advantage of the capabilities of FHIR. Furthermore, the set of matrices not within my control, being that new matrices can be created without control, which basically means that I cannot make a profile for each matrix.</p>",
