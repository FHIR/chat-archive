We could not find a fitting code in the contact type value set so we created our own \"research\" code. Since contact type has an extensible binding, this causes the validator to issue a \"warning\".<br>\n1. Can the validator somehow be configured to accept certain codes in certain places even if there is an extensible binding to a different value set?  (aka \"I know what i am doing\" setting)<br>\n2. Are there plans to extend the contact type vale set to include a code that would include our use case?</p>",
