My understanding is that if a covered entity under HIPAA uses a different standard than the adopted standards for these use cases, they are not compliant with HIPAA. With that logic, my understanding is that it is not HIPAA compliant to use the Claim resource for prior auth (use=preauthorization) or claims themselves in the US because the ANSI X12 278 and 837 are the adopted standards for these use cases under HIPAA.</p>\n<p>Has anyone else investigated this before? Does anyone know if it would be a HIPAA violation to use the Claim resource in the United States in place of the adopted standards under HIPAA?</p>",
