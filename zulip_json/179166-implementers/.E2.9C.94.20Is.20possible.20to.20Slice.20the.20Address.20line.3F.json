I.e. you need to specify a fixed value, pattern or value set for every line.  Also, address lines are not the same as address parts.  If I have a line that says \"#123A 456 Street North-West\", that's a single line and must always be represented as a single line.  If you want to break out the \"#123\" from \"A\" from \"456\" from \"Street\" from \"North-West\", you need to use extensions.  (Most of the extensions you need are already defined.)</p>",
