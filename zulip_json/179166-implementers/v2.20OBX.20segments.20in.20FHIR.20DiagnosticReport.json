If it is another \"Observation\" within \"contained\", what LOINC code would be the appropriate one for the name/code of the DiagnosticReport?</p>",

Although many implementers seem to skip the DiagnosticReport altogether and put the code in OBR-4 in Observation.code and If OBR-4 = OBX-3  and only a single OBX  you could map to a single Observation.  Otherwise could  use .Observation.related to  for panel components.  This second approach is lossy since  only some of the stuff in OBR can be mapped to Observation.</p>",

I'm assuming OBX-5 also maps to Observation.code, correct? I definitely want a DiagnosticReport in this case since I'm trying to represent a genetic test result report from a lab. I'll point to two Observations from the DiagnosticReport corresponding to the OBX-3 and OBX-5 fields. Do you see something wrong with this representation?</p>",

I was going to take a look at how to handle LOINC answer codes because I wasn't understanding how they'd link to the LOINC code they refer to. The link you suggest plus reading some more about codes so I know how to include the SNOMED-CT codes for Positive and Negative as well (in addition to the LA codes) should solve my problem.
