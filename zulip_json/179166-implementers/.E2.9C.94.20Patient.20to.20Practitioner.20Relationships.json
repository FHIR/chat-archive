These relationships can be Case Manager, Dentist, Psychiatrist, and around 25 more. </p>\n<p>So far I have come up with the following FHIR resources to put this information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RelatedPerson</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Not meant for health care relationships.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Patient.generalPractitioner</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Only good for the general practitioner, not for all the different types of relationships we have.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>CareTeam</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Itâ€™s not really a care team, as they operate individually of one another. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What would be the optimal way of representing these relationships?</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>",

It may be that the CareTeam members don't act like much of a team, but from a wholistic health perspective, they are one whether they recognize it or not.  And it would be a CareTeam 'managed' by the patient themselves, in that they'd define who's in which role.</p>",
