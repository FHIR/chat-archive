According to previous conversations in this channel, the BodyStructure resource seems to be the right choice to represent the tumors. However, the Condition resource only has a <em>bodySite</em> attribute of type CodeableConcept. Should this be updated to be a <em>bodySite[x]</em> that also allows referencing BodyStructure resources? I am currently using an extension but was wondering if there might be another way of representing this relationship that I might have missed.Link to BodyStructure from Condition resource</p>",
