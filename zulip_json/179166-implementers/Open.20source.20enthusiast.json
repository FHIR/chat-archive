(You'd originally posted under \"R4 Profiles\")</p>\n<p>It depends what you mean by \"your Organization\".  HL7 is a standards organization and does not, itself, really develop any code except that to make its own websites and services run.  It does, however, through the work of its volunteers, develop open \"standards specification\" that guide implementers on how to create interoperable healthcare applications.  A good number of the volunteers also create software that implements those standards and/or supports the development or implementation of those standards.  Some of those efforts are open source.</p>\n<p>What's driving your interest to participate?  What would you like to achieve?  That'll help us guide you to a project that would best fit your interests.</p>",
