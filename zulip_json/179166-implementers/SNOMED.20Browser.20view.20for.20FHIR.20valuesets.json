In the case of Device.kind, it says that the valueset is any concept that is-a 49062001.  Is there a way to get a list of all those codes in one view in the SNOMED CT Browser (or other similar tool)?  Just navigating to the Device node in the Taxonomy just shows the direct children, with an option to expand to see grandchildren.  If an organization is actually going through the mapping exercise, having the fill list in a single view without having to expand all the child nodes would be useful.</p>",
