One of our fields is meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack). There are no LOINC codes for this as we would expect to store the selection via observation.code (CodeableConcept). However, there are SNOMED codes. In this case, can we store just the SNOMED code without any FHIR repercussions if we do not store a LOINC code? I understand that v3 will require LOINC for some vitals stored in the Observation resource so curious what our options are here. Thanks for your help!</p>",
