I would like to host them under both /Patient (all patients) - and for convenience /MyPatient1 (patients only conforming to MyPatient1) and /MyPatient2 (patients only conforming to MyPatient2) - each being shorthand notation for the _profile parameter and also serve as endpoint with server speficied validation. But from what I can read in the spec and see in the capabilitystatement, that is not currently supported. To me it would sort of tidy things up.</p>",
