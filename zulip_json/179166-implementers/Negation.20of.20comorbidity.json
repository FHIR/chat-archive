For each comorbidity, there are 3 options I need to model:<br>\n(1) The patient has (suffers from) this comorbidity.<br>\n(2) The patient does *not* have this comorbidity.<br>\n(3) We do not know whether or not the patient has this comorbidity.<br>\nThe difference between (2) and (3) is important for the clinicians. Option (1) is the default; just having a Condition resource that specifies the comorbidity. Option (3) can be modeled as inexistence of such resource; if there is no diabetes resource for the patient, it means I don't know if the patient has diabetes or not. However, how do I model option (2) - negation?<br>\nThe initial thought was to extend the value-set of the \"Condition.clinicalStatus\" field. Is this possible in FHIR? It does not seem possible with the HAPI FHIR client library that we're using.<br>\nShould I use an extension of Condition resource to indicate that the patient does not suffer from the comorbidity? If so, then should it be an extension of a specific field, or an extension of the resource itself?</p>",
