I now need to remove one of the extensions.<br>\n<br>\nOnce I removed the extension, I noticed in my diff of the previous version, that all the other extensions that were previously in the profile structured definition now had new lines associated with them.<br>\n<br>\nExample:<br>\n-- line that were there previously for slice name<br>\n&lt;element id=\"ProcedureRequest.extension:{Slice name}\"&gt;<br>\n    &lt;path value=\"ProcedureRequest.extension\" /&gt;<br>\n    &lt;sliceName value={Slice name} /&gt;<br>\n    &lt;short value=\"Optional Extensions Element\" /&gt;<br>\n    &lt;definition value=\"Optional Extension Element - found in all resources.\" /&gt;<br>\n    &lt;max value=\"1\" /&gt;<br>\n        &lt;type&gt;<br>\n            &lt;code value=\"Extension\" /&gt;<br>\n            &lt;profile value={Extension URL} /&gt;<br>\n        &lt;/type&gt;<br>\n&lt;/element&gt;<br>\n<br>\n-- new lines added by Forge<br>\n+ &lt;element id=\"ProcedureRequest.extension:{Slice name}.url\"&gt;<br>\n+ &lt;path value=\"ProcedureRequest.extension.url\" /&gt;<br>\n+ &lt;fixedUri value={Extension URL} /&gt;<br>\n+ &lt;/element&gt;<br>\n<br>\nAgain, these lines were added to all previous extension in the profile structured definition where I had not changed anything.<br>\n<br>\nThe lines don't look incorrect, but I am fairly new to profiles. Is this a correction in Forge to add the URL for the profile extension ?</p>",
