Or is it incumbent upon the client to retrieve a PlanDefinition check for triggers outside the FHIR Server and only apply  once ready to receive an appropriate resource?</p>\n<p>What is the approach that is recommend or currently compliant?</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Joel, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192545\">@Alex Goel</span></p>",
