When we do a Patient.$everything operation, we consult the patient compartment to find out which resources are considered as part of patient's data. The Sequence resource not being part of the patient compartment seems like an omission to me...or does this fall under FHIR's 80/20 rule?</p>",

However, the CG work group is exploring the notion of making Sequence \"definitional\" rather than patient-specific.  If that happens, it wouldn't be part of the compartment anymore.  For now, I'd recommend submitting a change request.  That way, once we figure out what we're doing with it, we can make sure it's in if appropriate.</p>",
