Principal diagnosis is defined by a Medicare rule as the diagnosis that, after study, to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care. It is likely, but not necessarily true, that the principal diagnosis will be the first one listed after hospital discharge.  Encounter.diagnosis.rank might be considered with \"1\" as the first, and likely principal diagnosis. However, is there a more correct representation of an Encounter-related principal diagnosis in FHIR?</p>",
