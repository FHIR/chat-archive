It is limited to electronic case reporting.   But thanks for responding!  <br>\nThe USCDI v1 adds 3 new data classes, “Allergies and Intolerances,” “Clinical Notes,” and “Provenance;” and adds “Patient Demographics” data elements “Previous Address,” “Phone Number,” “Phone Number Type,” and “Email Address” that were not defined in the CCDS. This requires updates to the Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) standard and updates to the following certification criteria:<br>\n•   §170.315(b)(1) (transitions of care)<br>\n•   (e)(1) (view, download, and transmit to 3rd party)<br>\n•   (g)(6) (Consolidated CDA creation performance)<br>\n•   (f)(5) (transmission to public health agencies – electronic case reporting);  this does not include immunizations, syndromic surveillance,  cancer registry, antibicrobial use, or health care surveys.<br>\n•   (g)(9) (application access – all data request)</p>",
