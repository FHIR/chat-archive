I'm trying to search for all instances of Basic with a given profile using the following url:<br>\n{{URL}}/Basic?_profile=http://stelar.org/StructureDefinition/stelar/profile/questionResponse'</p>\n<p>The problem is that I always get a 504 gateway timeout returned.  I didn't really think 370,000 instances would be too many, and I figured something like that should work out of the box.</p>\n<p>Is there a standard way of either increasing the timeout of a call, or having a way of keeping it alive, which I haven't seen in the spec?</p>",

All the CarePlan.outcomeReferences in this case reference Encounter resources, if that helps. Not sure if there is a fancy way to do a _revinclude or if :iterate can match based on matching resources and not just the base resource. </p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
