If you publish to Simplifier from within Forge, the tool will automatically generate the snapshot before uploading. However if you upload it manually through the web interface, you have to make sure that the StructureDefinition contains a snapshot in order to get a complete rendering of the structure. Check the Forge Options menu, there is a setting to enable snapshots when saving to disk (disabled by default, as the snapshot is quite large).</p>",
