So this looks like a \"natural fit\" for representing things like CTCAE. </p>",

Observation lets you capture things like an elevated temperature, the presence of a rash, etc.  But if you want to assert an ongoing situation, Condition is what allows you to assert a diagnosis, severity, etc. and manage the evolution of the condition over time.  So a single episode of nausea might be an Observation.  Noting that the patient experiences ongoing nausea due to one of their other meds would be a Condition.</p>",
