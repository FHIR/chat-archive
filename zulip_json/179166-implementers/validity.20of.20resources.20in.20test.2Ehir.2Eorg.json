Systems are allowed to check references and enforce that they're valid on create and/or enforce they remain valid over the lifetime of the source and target objects, but there's no requirement to do so.  In a real system, if you choose to delete a resource that is referenced by another resource, the appropriate action may vary based on the type of resource and the type of reference.  Maintaining referential integrity for cross-server references is nigh impossible - the owner of the referenced resource may have no clue what references it.</p>",
