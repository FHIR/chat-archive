I have some data fields that's puzzling me where to put (most of the patient/encounter/observation/procedure is trivial). It especially concerns the following pieces of information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>incident</strong> (could this be a <strong>ServiceRequest</strong> or is it maybe closer to an <strong>Episode of Care</strong>): Which would partly contain the incident-<em>location</em>, delivery-<em>location</em> and <em>responsible/managing organization</em> but where to put the incident description and following <em>report</em> (both probably just simple string extensions)? What is also needed is an 'arrival'-priority <em>valueSet</em> and a 'delivery'-priority <em>valueSet</em>.</li>\n<li>I lean towards putting attributes such as hospital-ETA, and patient identification method/type on the <strong>Encounter</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Input to this would be highly valued</p>",
