The Code system is not SNOMED or LOINC, but a complete FHIR CodeSystem. I realize that \"filters\" are server specific, but I wonder if anyone have implemented this? or plan to do so? It would decrease the maintenance burden significantly, because additions to the CodeSystem in most cases, would not require a manual update of the related ValueSets.</p>\n<p>Suggestions for alternative implementations are also welcome :-) I wonder how I could use the CodeSystem $subsume operation.....</p>\n<p>I have tried using a hapi fhir server. I can implement the CodeSystem and ValueSet, but not use the expand operator (naturally), since the server does not implement the filter.</p>",
