Grateful for a quick sanity check - if I search a resource type and there are 10 matches, but I return them in 2 pages of 5, should Bundle.total be 5 or 10?</p>\n<p>I think 10 - but someone has pointed out to me that the statement in the spec can be interpreted in both ways. E.g. \"In addition, Bundle.total may be used to return the total number of resources that match the search, and that may be returned by following the \"next\" link.\" - this (arguably) still makes sense either way.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts much appreciated.</p>",
