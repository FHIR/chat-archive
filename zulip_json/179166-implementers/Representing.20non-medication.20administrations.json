There are three possibilities for representing these using FHIR:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>leverage the existing MedicationRequest and MedicationAdministration resources and revamp the scope to allow capture of administration of 'substances' other than medications.  This would allow leveraging the existing elements that deal with dose, rate, etc.</li>\n<li>leverage the ServiceRequest and Procedure resources and add new core elements or extensions to support capturing concept such as 'dose', 'rate', etc.</li>\n<li>define a new set of resources</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general, we usually drive such decisions based on \"What do systems currently use to represent these concepts?\" - so for systems that handle ordering and retaining records of radiation, photo-therapy, transfusions, etc, would you generally use the same structures/interfaces you use for ordering and resulting meds, for ordering  and resulting imaging/labs, or something else?</p>\n<p>NOTE: Landing this is important to allowing ServiceRequest, Procedure and the Medication resources to progress to normative.</p>",

Coming up with a path forward is great and something I am interested in from a Radiation Therapy perspective but not having a means to deal with this for previous and current versions of FHIR is problematic because systems do not necessarily keep in step with the latest.  There are still some significantly sized EHRs out there that are still DSTU2.   Going back that far may be a stretch but guidance for R4 would certainly be useful.</p>",

Given how you currently capture such things as radiation therapy, photo therapy, shock therapy and other 'administrations' where the notion of 'dose' and 'rate' come into play, but where we're not talking about medications, what would make the most sense from a resource perspective - broaden the Medication[x] resources to encompass these concepts; extend Procedure to capture dose &amp; rate-related elements; define an additional set of resources to cover the space; something else??  (The use-case would need to cover both the Request side and the Administration side - presume we don't really need to worry about 'summary' or 'dispense' concepts here.</p>",
