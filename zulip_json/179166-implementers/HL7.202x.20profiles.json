My question relates to HL7 conformance profiles and programmatic creation of Orion Health/Lyniate Rhapsody definition files (.s3d).  Does anyone know of anything out there to facilitate the process?  I've been out of it for a 6+ years and imagine there'd be something by now.  This is the doc I'm trying to constrain for <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/standards/dstu/V26_IG_VR_BAFDRPT_R1_STU2.1_2020APR.pdf\">http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/standards/dstu/V26_IG_VR_BAFDRPT_R1_STU2.1_2020APR.pdf</a></p>",

Happy to talk more if it's helpful.</p>",
