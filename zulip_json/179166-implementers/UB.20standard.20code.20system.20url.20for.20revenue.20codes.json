I have been able to find only <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0456\">http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0456</a> with the only associated valueset I see being <a href=\"https://terminology.hl7.org/1.0.0/ValueSet-v2-0456.html\">https://terminology.hl7.org/1.0.0/ValueSet-v2-0456.html</a> which contains only 7 higher level category codes from the total UB code set. In order to specify a code system that includes all the standard revenue codes, is a different CodeSystem that should be specified? Or does the <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0456\">http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0456</a> refer to the full list?</p>",
