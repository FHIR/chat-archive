For example, the client has to specify the type explicitly using the syntax in the second example above.\" Where the syntax in question is:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>GET [base]/DiagnosticReport?subject:Patient.name=peter\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Now I'm wondering, what would this requirement look like in the _filter search language?
