I was wondering what was the best way to represent Provider Accreditations on the DaVinci PDEX Plan Net IG.<br>\nThe plan is to map accreditations to the Practitioner.qualifications field, and so far what I have in mind is to just use the text field inside the CodeableConcept structure. However I was wondering if there would be a more standardized way to expose this data. <br>\nAlso, I wanted to fill out the <strong>Practitioner.qualifications.issuer</strong> field with the name of the AccreditationAgency (E.g: National Committee for Quality Assurance), but this field is a reference to an organization profile which the AccreditationAgency is not. How can I provide this information?</p>\n<p>Edit:<br>\nAlso, how can I specify that this type of Provider.qualification is an Accreditation vs a Board Certification, etc. Is there a binding for this? I can't find one..</p>",
