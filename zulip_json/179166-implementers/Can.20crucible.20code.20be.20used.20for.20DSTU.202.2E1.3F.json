It's unlikely the Crucible maintainers will updated the product to support that release because Infoway is the only organization we're aware of using that release.  (And the Crucible creators are U.S.-based and funded by U.S. organizations).  So you'd be looking at having to extend Crucible yourselves to support the release.  I don't have the experience with Crucible to evaluate how challenging a task that would be.  (The good news is that you don't need to support all of the STU2 resources, just those used by PrescribeIT.)</p>",
