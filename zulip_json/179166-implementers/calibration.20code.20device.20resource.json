Similar to the code on a batch of glucose meter test strips that calibrates the meter to batch characteristics. Is it best considered as the attribute of a flow meter set, which is in turn a separately modeled component of a multicomponent device system, or is the calibration code of the current flow meter set best considered more simply as a changeable temporary attribute value of the principal device, which you could consider using the 'properties' name-value tuple in its Device resource to hold? Depends on the kinds of things your use case needs to be able to do with them.</p>",
