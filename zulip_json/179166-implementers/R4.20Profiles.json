A schema (json or xml/xsd) is another way to represent that structure, in a less complete way, but that more common industry tooling can deal with. The schemas are created from the structure definitions. Only FHIR specific tooling can deal with structure definitions.<br>\nDid you find the FHIR downloads page that is referenced above your post?</p>",
