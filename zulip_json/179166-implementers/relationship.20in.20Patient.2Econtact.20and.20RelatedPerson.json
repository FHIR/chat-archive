Section 8.1.6 in the Patient resource page touches on the differences between Patient.contact and RelatedPerson but they seem relatively similar. I'm wondering why the value sets for the relationship element are different. The Patient.contact value set (extensible) is pretty limited and corresponds to v2 table HL70131 (which is used by NK1-7 (Role) rather than NK1-3 (Relationship) which in my v2 experience is much more widely used). In contrast. RelatedPerson.relationship uses a different value set (preferred) which combines both HL70131 values and SNOMED values more inline with the NK1-3 relationships (mother, father, aunt, etc). Does anyone know the history between these items, particularly why the Patient.contact.relationship value set is skinnier than the v2 and RelatedPerson values? Thanks.</p>",
