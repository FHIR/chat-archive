I have a resource within a bundle that needs to be created and has a versioned reference that is pointing to a resource that needs to be updated. Here, the resource that needs to created  cannot obtain a updated version of referenced resource within a transaction due to the processing rules stated above, as POST is always executing before PUT. Are these two rules contradicting with each other?</p>",
