We are trying to search for practitioners using <br>\nSearchAsync to get the result bundle, and ContinueAsync(_bundle, (PageDirection)direction) To get the next page bundle, previous page bundle, etc.  But the navigate previous always return empty bundle, any advice on this? I do notice that in the returned result bundle, the  PreviousLink property is always null. Anyone could help please? thanks!</p>",

But using FHIR Client's <strong>ContinueAsync</strong> method doesn't seem to work. It works correctly if we navigate forward but not previous. HTMS.</p>",
