At that time STU3 was the current version and the plugin was broken.</p>\n<p>I have tested the plugin again, and it appears to be working with STU3, but not with R4. When I attempt to validate a resource, I continue to receive this error: <br>\n\"Validation Process Failed: Item not found<br>\nItem not found\"</p>\n<p>Is it currently broken with R4, or is something with my install messed up? I tried to test with official FHIR resource examples, and received the same error.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\n-Josh</p>",
