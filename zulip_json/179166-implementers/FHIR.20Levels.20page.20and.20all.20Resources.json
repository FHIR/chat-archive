If they click on one of the modules, they don't have all of the Resources that are available in FHIR.  For example, Organization Affiliation is not linked from Patient Administration, Charge Item and Charge Item Definition is not linked that I can find (i.e. under Patient Admin or Finance).  Should they all be or should we have some indication that they might find more if they look at the Resources pages?</p>",
