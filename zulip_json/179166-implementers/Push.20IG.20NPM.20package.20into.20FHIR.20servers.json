With IGs being fundamental to FHIR, and the NPM IG packaging being the supported approach, I would find it odd if such a tool does not already exist. SmileCDR has an API to ingest NPM packages, but I'm looking to push and prefer non-proprietary.</p>",

I want to publish an IG and POST/PUT the generated conformance resources to a FHIR server. That's it. IG are packaged as FHIR NPM but, there's no obvious open source tooling to POST/PUT those conformance resources to a server. I'm curious that this hasn't come up - it seems (to me) to be an obvious workflow. I'm happy to be educated otherwise. (Like others, I can break out a programming language  and have a go at parsing package.json. In my use case, I need to POST/PUT several IGs and for several FHIR servers in a QA/E2E situation)</p>",
