Can anyone shed any light and possible resolution for the issue? I suspect it is CORS and i have enabled CORS as per the hapi suggestions here: <a href=\"http://hapifhir.io/doc_cors.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hapifhir.io/doc_cors.html\">http://hapifhir.io/doc_cors.html</a></p>\n<p>Any advice is appreciated.</p>",
