        "content": "<p>It's great to see some movement around CQL and FHIR!  Hopefully you've seen the CoffeeScript java execution project by now.  It's not a transpiler, but rather a JSON ELM interpreter.  It already handles a very large portion of the spec (I'd guess &gt; 90%) and we have successfully used _browserify_ to compile it down to a single JS file that works in a browser.  Since you reference the CQL-to-ELM compiler, I'm assuming you were already aware of it, but if not:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/cqframework/clinical_quality_language/tree/master/Src/coffeescript/cql-execution\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cqframework/clinical_quality_language/tree/master/Src/coffeescript/cql-execution\">https://github.com/cqframework/clinical_quality_language/tree/master/Src/coffeescript/cql-execution</a></p>\n<p>Within that tree you'll find a partial FHIR solution, but there are two caveats: (1) it uses an older version of FHIR, and (2) it currently expects flat files of bundles (each representing a patient).  Within the \"test/elm\" folder, you'll find test cases that use FHIR resources as the test data to run against.  These are unit tests, so they tend to be at the more detailed level (e.g., does the \"multiply\" operator work) rather than real use cases.  But still, it may be helpful if you haven't seen it yet.</p>",

Yes I am currently working through those test cases now and asking <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191359\">@Bryn Rhodes</span> a series of daft noob questions. I am planning to establish a pattern based on promises that should enable use of restful fhir queries.  To be honest I probably should have just gone with your coffee script interpreter but when I raised the desire for a compliler <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> egged me on to write one myself and I took the bait. I am only doing it in my spare time but progress is faster than I expected. I think the code scrutiny of the spec that I am giving will at least uncover glaring issues as well as lead me to have a good grounding in the language. </p>",

Hopefully that means we did something right when we designed all of this stuff!  We tried to strike some balance between ease of authoring and ease of implementation -- and I think ELM allowed us to hit that balance well (ease of authoring through CQL, ease of implementation through ELM).  Definitely interested in your experience as you continue on!  We (MITRE) did an HQMF-to-JS transpiler for the HQMF/QDM-based eCQM measures.  While it worked, we found it difficult to debug the measures sometimes, but I think that was due more to some implementation-unfriendly features of QDM.  I expect an ELM-to-JS transpiler should be cleaner -- and it will be interesting to see the pros and cons of the transpiler vs the interpreter.  It's always good to have choices!</p>",
