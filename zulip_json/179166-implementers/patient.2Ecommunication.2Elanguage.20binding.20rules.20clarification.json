It seems that validator allows custom 3 letter codes code system and value set binding although default binding is bcp47. Also language binding says \"preferred to common languages but limited to AllLanguages\". Does \"limited to\" mean that the system must be bcp47? If so, it looks that validator does not validate it this way. Can someone provide some clarification on this?</p>",
