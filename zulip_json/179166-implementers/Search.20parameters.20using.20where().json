We have email/phone for ContactPoint, and depends-on/derived-from/predecessor/successor for RelatedArtifact. It looks to me like a single composite parameter for each would have a couple of advantages - more generalization with fewer search parameters. No need to generate N separate search parameters for the N specific enum values that people currently think are important.</p>",
