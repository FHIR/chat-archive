Let's not underestimate the importance of design. People do judge a book on it's cover. <br>\nAnd It's crucial to recognize that developers are not designers. UI/UX design is a specialization. Also, I've learned from experience that asking users for design input is not always helpful - degustibus not disputandum.</p>",
