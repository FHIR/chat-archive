(And what is the correct thumbnail size and quality for all clients?) Asking for a thumbnail to be rendered on the fly is potentially expanding the role of the server, and, since it could be rendering (instead of just storing) diagnostically significant information, may cause the server to fall under a different FDA classification.  I don't think this should be an expected behavior of any server.</p>\n<p>How are you determining which attachments to create thumbnails for? Only image/jpg mimetype? image/png? what about application/pdf, application/word, or text/xml? </p>\n<p>I'd suggest that you define an operation on Observation (or on Media) that lets you specify the rendering parameters requested. (Unfortunately, I don't think you can specify an operation on a datatype, which could then be available for all attachments.)</p>\n<p>Alternatively, and depending on what these images are, look at using ImagingStudy with a DICOMweb server to handle the image storage and rendering.</p>",

I'm trying to figure out what the transaction would look like to embed the image in a DiagnosticReport, Questionnaire, or Observation. Would the radiologist need to flag key images?

In the example on the ImagingStudy page: \"Dr. Skann interprets the study on a PACS workstation, and he selects two key image frames to be included in the diagnostic report; this selection is stored back to the PACS as a DICOM Key Object Selection with the title \"For Report Attachment\", and the PACS makes it available (transcodes it) as a FHIR ImagingManifest resource. Dr. Skann dictates the report using a structured data entry report writing program, including a recommendation for a cardiac catheterization procedure, and signs it. The report writing program formats the report as a CDA  document, retrieves the ImagingManifest resource, and inserts the referenced key images into the report.\" (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/imagingstudy.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/imagingstudy.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/imagingstudy.html</a>) In this example is the PACS assigning some kind of UID to the key images which appears in the ImagingManifest? If that's the case,  would the key image be linked to the study in order to retrieve the entire study later in the example? I'm not sure if DICOMWeb supports querying, and if that's the case the assumption would be that the EHR would need all the IDs necessary to get both the key images and the full study. Is that correct? </p>",

You can either create your own ImagingManifest of the images you want to include, or use one that represents a DICOM KOS (key object selection file) or KIN (key image note). An advantage of this approach is that the consumer is free to determine how to render the images (size, crop, format, etc.); a disadvantage of this approach is that the consumer has to determine how to render the images.<br>\n2. DiagnosticReport.image references Media. You can put spedific renderings of images in the Media.content.attachment (preferably referenced by URL, not binary inline). The advantage of this approach is that the image presentation can be specified at report composition time, and the consumer just has to invoke the URL.</p>",

Anyone who wants to use an image, builds the image URL from [WADO-RS base]/study/{studyUID}/series/{seriesUID}/instance/{instanceUID} (or equivalent for WADO-URI. Then they tack on the query parameters for rendering if they want. On the other hand, Media contains a complete URL including any rendering parameters the report author wants to add. </p>\n<p>This isn't a WADO-URI vs. WADO-RS issue. The one gives full control over the rendering to the consumer; the other gives control to the reporting system.*</p>\n<p>(I* suppose a system could strip  rendering parmeters off a  URL and then reapply the rendering parameters it wanted, but that's another level of effort by the consumer.)</p>",
