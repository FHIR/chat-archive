After searching by Google, It seems that except the main resources like patient or observation, I should use \"DiagnsoticReport\" plus \"Condition\" ? I got three questions,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is it correct by using DiagnosticReport and Condition to store the stroke report data?</li>\n<li>Any other resources that  I can use to store my stroke data?</li>\n<li>I built a HAPI FHIR server in my virtual machine which stored the ultrasound system report,  is it possible to connect with my local HAPI FHIR? (I mean can I transfer the data between these two HAPI server)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thank you</p>",
