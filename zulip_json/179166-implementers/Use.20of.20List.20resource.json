We are finding List very useful in terms of providing context to related resources in messaging environments (we use List.code to provide the context). <br>\nFor example in a discharge letter we use list to \"band together\" medications that were discontinued, medications that were newly prescribed etc. in separate Lists. We use List to represent problems as recorded in General Practice. We use List to document the resuscitation methods attempted on newborns.<br>\nDoes this sound like a good use of the List resource, or is there a better way to represent these clinical concepts? What are others using the List resource for?</p>",

In terms of discharge, it'd be more typical to have a single list and use the entry.flag to distinguish what was added, changed or removed.  But using a list to group all of the meds for discharge (or admission) or to represent a particular practitioner's problem list is exactly what List was intended for.</p>",
