The 21st Century Cures Act states:<br>\n\"Health IT Modules presented for testing and certification must include the ability for patients to authorize an application to receive their EHI based on FHIR resource-level scopes. Specifically, this means patients would need to have the ability to authorize access to their EHI at the individual FHIR resource level, from one specific FHIR resource (e.g., “Immunization”) up to all FHIR resources necessary to implement the standard adopted in § 170.213 and implementation specification adopted in § 170.215(a)(2). This capability will give patients increased control over how much EHI they authorize applications of their choice to receive. For example, if a patient downloaded a medication management application, they would be able to use these authorization scopes to limit the EHI accessible by the application to only information contained in FHIR “MedicationRequest” and “Medication” profile.\"  </p>\n<p>Does this literally mean that we need to give patients the ability to select which resources they will share with each application that might request access to their data?   In other words, if, as a patient, I want to use 3 different applications, do I have to indicate that I will share Meds, Allergies and Problems with Application A; I will share Meds, Allergies, Problems, and Immunizations with Application B; I will share everything with Application C?  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.</p>",

An example would be a referral letter for a patient from a specialist sent to the primary care provider, that is manually scanned into the CEHRT. According to the specification the author would be the individual performing the scan and not the originator of the content, the specialist.
