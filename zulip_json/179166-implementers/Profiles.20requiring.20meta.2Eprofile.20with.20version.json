If you can't do that, then the profile contains 'extra' information and the implementation is non-conformant.  If a profile declaration has any meaning other than \"this instance will validate against profile X\", that additional meaning <em>must</em> be expressed in some other way (typically by adding an extension).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The valid rationale for declaring an extension in an instance is to allow for more efficient validation by the recipient.  If you know what a profile claims to be valid against, you can check that instance more efficiently than if you need to check against all possible candidates.  However, in practice, there are generally discriminators that allow you to quickly choose a relatively small pool of profiles to evaluate against.  (e.g. if I was trying to decide what US Core profile to check an instance against, I'd check resource type and category).  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Receivers <em>should</em> check instances for profile validity regardless of declaration (unless you're super brave or have really rigorous conformance testing and strict control of change, in which case you're essentially in a closed interoperability environment).  Even well intentioned systems will sometimes accidentally ingest bogus data or make minor tweaks that suddenly cause data to no longer be fully conformant.  (Changes in the terminology space as codes get added/deprecated can also cause issues.)  So the presence of a profile declaration shouldn't usually be taken in substitution of checking that he rules are met.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The 'ideal' design objective with FHIR is for systems to emit a single resource instance that subsequently gets consumed by <em>all</em> recipients.  I.e. you don't emit different data for different consumers, you emit the same data for everyone (allowing for a security layer that strips elements/responses that the requester isn't allowed to see).  Demanding that instances declare desired profiles in order to interoperate imposes a tax on the sender because they have to modify their interface for each consumer who wants a distinct profile declaration (and each consumer will potentially want profile declarations specific to their needs).  Imposing such a tax isn't prohibited, but it should be carefully considered in terms of the total cost to the community.  Does the savings on the consumer in terms of increased efficiency of routing to appropriate validation outweigh the cost of modifying, testing and long-term maintenance of the profile declaration on the sending systems?  The calculation will vary depending on the number of receiving systems vs. sending systems as well as on the volume of candidate profiles the receiver might need to triage against.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The risk of mandating profile declaration (and particularly version-specific profile declaration) is that it acts as a barrier to interoperability.  \"Nope, sorry, can't consume your data because you don't declare profile X, version Y.  Please go away and customize your application and then I'll consider consuming your data\" (when the data itself already met all requirements for consumption).  \"You must customize your application\" inevitably translates into delay and significant dollars, even if the change is minor.  Sometimes it translates into failure of interoperability to occur at all - especially if the receiver doesn't have the leverage of regulation or large $$$ on their side.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this specific case, if you can't tell if an EOB is institutional or outpatient except by looking at the profile, then the specification is not FHIR conformant.  The institutional/outpatient determination <em>must</em> be exposed in some other way - in the worst case, as an extension.</p>",

The server is not the same as the receiver. The server is the receiver on POST and PUT, but the client is the receiver on GET or search. In the latter case, Lloyd's point that <code>Senders are never required to inspect the capabilities of the receiver</code> makes perfect sense. Similarly, with POST and PUT, it is up to the client to determine if it cares about the success or failure of the request.</p>",

Such configuration is very much expected to be the exception, not the norm.  What configuration <strong>is</strong> done will generally be focused on \"what is the client <em>allowed</em> to access?\", not \"what does the client support?\".  It's not the server's problem if the client doesn't support all of the data sent in a query response. </li>\n<li>If a server is responding to a post, it'll either store the record or not, depending on whether it meets its business rule.  Very few clients will have the ability to configure what they send at runtime based on declared profiles.  The POST/PUT will either work or it won't and some of the data sent will quite possibly be ignored.  That's normal FHIR operation, not special in any way</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's certainly possible to manipulate what's received on a per sender basis, but that's more the path of the old messaging paradigm where you had to play around with the data with an interface engine.  The intention with REST is you expose an interface and spit out what you've got and the receiver can take it or leave it.  Any manipulation is focused on access permissions, not profiles.</p>",
