The mobile devices will report accuracy for these values as well and the distribution of accuracy values is actually pretty ugly especially for poor gps chipsets.</p>\n<p>Similarly, is there anything in the works for more than just geopoints in the standard-extensions? We have hotspot tools for both individual patients and population health that allow users to view hotspots that are polygons. We used geojson here for all geo and it worked really well to convey any type of geo data.</p>",
