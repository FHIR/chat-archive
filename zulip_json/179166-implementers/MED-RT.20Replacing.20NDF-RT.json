Are there any plans to add MED-RT to the list of FHIR terminologies and if so is there a time line?</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nJohn</p>",

Ultimately, we don't want to keep relying on the core spec for publishing terminologies, but since NDF-RT is already there I agree that adding MED-RT makes sense.  Submitting a tracker would be in order, if you want to do that (or I can).  And posting that back here and also on the terminology stream would be good.</p>",
