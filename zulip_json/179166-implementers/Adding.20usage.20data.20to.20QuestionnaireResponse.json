We want to enrich the data with information about the usage of our forms. For example: when was the form sent to the patient, when was the due date for responding, when did the patient respond, did they complete their response or give up, etc.</p>\n<p>I am trying to decide whether it is reasonable to treat the process of sending a digital form to a patient and getting their response as a special kind of \"Encounter\" (and so capturing these data points in that resource, with the QuestionnaireResponse linked), or whether it is more sensible to just add Extensions to QuestionnaireResponse to capture these extra data points.</p>\n<p>I'd really appreciate any other views on this, thanks.</p>",
