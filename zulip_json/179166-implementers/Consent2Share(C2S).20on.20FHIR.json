I was going to upgrade the FHIR version of C2S to R4.<br>\nIn order to do this, I used hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter project (<a href=\"https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter\">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter</a>) and I updated some configurations of C2S so that C2S works on the new FHIR(R4).<br>\nWhen I run the provider-ui of C2S to create/update a patient, it calls FHIR REST APIs using fhir client while it calls ums(user management system) of C2S and I got the above error. Please check the error.log file I attached.<br>\nI don't know well about the change from Conformance to CapabilityStatement. <br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/hnak3iKpxWJnHCc4oHYOiDOa/image_2020_07_10T18_37_55_982Z.png\">image_2020_07_10T18_37_55_982Z.png</a> <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/low5ERRdr0n4rwnLdRiwH1V4/image_2020_07_10T18_38_30_271Z.png\">image_2020_07_10T18_38_30_271Z.png</a> <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/JwPu_kanNz-lqimjnNTXgLIZ/image_2020_07_10T18_40_51_255Z.png\">image_2020_07_10T18_40_51_255Z.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/hnak3iKpxWJnHCc4oHYOiDOa/image_2020_07_10T18_37_55_982Z.png\" title=\"image_2020_07_10T18_37_55_982Z.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/hnak3iKpxWJnHCc4oHYOiDOa/image_2020_07_10T18_37_55_982Z.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/low5ERRdr0n4rwnLdRiwH1V4/image_2020_07_10T18_38_30_271Z.png\" title=\"image_2020_07_10T18_38_30_271Z.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/low5ERRdr0n4rwnLdRiwH1V4/image_2020_07_10T18_38_30_271Z.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/JwPu_kanNz-lqimjnNTXgLIZ/image_2020_07_10T18_40_51_255Z.png\" title=\"image_2020_07_10T18_40_51_255Z.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/JwPu_kanNz-lqimjnNTXgLIZ/image_2020_07_10T18_40_51_255Z.png\"></a></div>",
