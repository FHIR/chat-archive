We noticed that <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-22766\">FHIR-22766</a> was replaced by <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32351\">FHIR-32351</a>. So for now,  we choose to use a backport extension based on these new core elements. </p>\n<p>I applied the changes for the new elements in this PR here: <a href=\"https://github.com/HL7/fhir/pull/1400\">https://github.com/HL7/fhir/pull/1400</a>. Just FYI, hope it saves you some time when you apply the change.</p>",
