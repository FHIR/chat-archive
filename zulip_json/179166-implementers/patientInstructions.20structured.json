We have an Appointment in which we want to place patientInstructions.. the field Appointment.patientInstructions field seems to discribe our use-case but its an 0..1 multiplicity String type.. we would like to keep the different instructions seperated.</p>\n<p>Based on a current HL7V2 OML message OML-&gt;ORC-&gt;OBR-&gt;OBX the instruction is placed in the OBX segment. which makes me beleive the FHIR Oberservation is also an option. Appointment.reasonReference but then again if i see that description:<br>\n<em>Reason the appointment has been scheduled to take place, as specified using information from another resource. When the patient arrives and the encounter begins it may be used as the admission diagnosis. The indication will typically be a Condition (with other resources referenced in the evidence.detail), or a Procedure.</em></p>\n<p>It may be used as the admission diagnosis.. is telling the patient that he/she has to be sober to attent the appointment an admission diagnosis and thus a right use-case to use the Appointment.reasonReference?</p>\n<p>Is there an other Resource (could't find one)? Or is making an extension an better solution?</p>",

However we do have other types of Appointment-related patient communications, such as letters, visit guides, questionnaires, etc., but all of those have a home in other FHIR resources.  Though maybe it makes sense to have a more specific link to those from Appointment than supportingInformation.  For example, Communication does have a \"reasonReference\", but that doesn't include Appointment.  If it did, then you could probably satisfy this by using a few different Communication  resources that reference the Appointment.</p>",
