One of the things we're building now is the X-Provenance function, in HAPI. So I wanted to share some ideas and would love to hear your thoughts on this!</p>\n<p>What would you say about having a Interceptor (pre-provider) that puts relevant custom-header into RequestDetails.userData and then in the provider extract this and attach it to the resource before going further down into ejb/mapping? Another suggestion have been to put HttpServletRequest into the relevant Provider-methods and then check there if X-Provenance exists, but I think I prefer going for an interceptor!</p>",
