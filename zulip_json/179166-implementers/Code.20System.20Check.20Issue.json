Now I try to create a new Appointment Resource on Hapi test server <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/</a>. The payload is like:<br>\n{<br>\n    \"resourceType\":\"Appointment\",<br>\n    \"status\":\"booked\",<br>\n    \"description\":\"Outp. Visit\",<br>\n    \"start\":\"2018-05-17T10:00:00Z\",<br>\n    \"end\":\"2018-05-17T10:00:00Z\",<br>\n    \"serviceCategory\":{<br>\n        \"coding\":[<br>\n            {<br>\n                \"system\":\"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/service-category\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/service-category\">http://hl7.org/fhir/service-category</a>\",<br>\n                \"code\":\"gp1\",<br>\n                \"display\":\"Adoption\"<br>\n            }<br>\n        ]<br>\n    },<br>\n    \"participant\":[<br>\n        {<br>\n            \"actor\":{<br>\n                \"display\":\"Liu Mike\"<br>\n            },<br>\n            \"status\":\"accepted\"<br>\n        }<br>\n    ]<br>\n}<br>\nFor ServiceCategory part, I use the code \"gp1\" which is not existed in the code system \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/service-category\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/service-category\">http://hl7.org/fhir/service-category</a>\", I suppose the result of this creation will fail, not actually it created successfully. <br>\nI don't know where the problem is. Could you help on that?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Servers are free to decide how much, if any, validation they'll do on inbound data.  While the server <em>could</em> check that code and determine that it's not currently allowed in its specified code system, there's a performance cost to doing so on all coding repetitions for all coded elements.  Therefore it may not do so by default.  If it's one of our public test servers, it <em>should</em> check though - as we're less concerned about performance and more concerned about guiding implementers toward correct implementation.  If it's a local HAPI install, then you'll probably need to configure it to be more aggressive with validation if you want it to detect these sorts of issues.</p>",
