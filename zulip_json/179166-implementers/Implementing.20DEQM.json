I have a few questions re: implementation of DEQM.</p>\n<p>The implementation guide states: The implementation guides in this landscape are currently focused on FHIR STU3, with the plan to produce R4 versions once the US Core and QI Core profiles have been updated to R4.</p>\n<p>My questions for the community are:</p>\n<p>1) Is anyone actually trying to implement any of the DEQM profiles yet?</p>\n<p>2) If so, are you building profiles as currently specified (i.e., based on R3)? Or are you making assumptions on what the profiles may look like once aligned w/ R4?</p>\n<p>For example, if we consider the CQFM Library profile, (which currently builds from the R3 Library resource) there is an element called \"contributor\" of type \"Contributor\" (where the Contributor profile requires terminology binding to ContributorType codes). For the R4 Library resource, the \"contributor\" element was removed (and as such, there is no terminology binding requirement). In this case, if an implementer builds from the DEQM IG in its current state (i.e., builds from the R3 Library resource), there is a risk of building out terminology bindings that are likely to not be necessary in the near future (i.e., once the DEQM implementation guide is aligned with R4).</p>\n<p>Any feedback would be much appreciated, especially from implementers and the DaVinic community. Thank you!</p>",

Whether you implement STU3 or R4 versions depends largely on the systems you are likely to receive data from for quality reporting. There are systems implementing both versions at this point. Regarding \"contributor\" specifically, it was replaced by role-specific elements as part of a general change between STU3 and R4, so an <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/measure-definitions.html#Measure.author\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/measure-definitions.html#Measure.author\">author</a> in R4 was represented in STU3 as a <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/measure-definitions.html#Measure.contributor\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/measure-definitions.html#Measure.contributor\">contributor</a> with a <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/metadatatypes-definitions.html#Contributor.type\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/metadatatypes-definitions.html#Contributor.type\">type</a> of <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/codesystem-contributor-type.html#contributor-type-author\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/codesystem-contributor-type.html#contributor-type-author\">author</a>.</p>",

Re: element \"condition-dueTo\".</p>\n<p>1) I see that the type is <em>CodableConcept, Reference</em>. Does this imply that this field can be populated with either a <em>CoadableConcept</em> or a <em>Reference</em> to another profile? If so, is there a preference as to which is used?</p>\n<p>2) And if <em>Reference</em> is used, the reference range is specified as as: <em>Condition | Procedure | MedicationAdministration | Immunization</em>. In this case, would the reference actually be to <em>QICore-Condition, QICore-Procedure, QICore-MedicationAdministration, QICore-Immunization</em>? In other words, should a QICore profile reference other QICore profiles when available?</p>\n<p>Thanks again for any guidance you can give!</p>",
