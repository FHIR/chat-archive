However I also want to fetch conditions pertaining to direct child concepts of the code. I want build a query which fetches me the bundle containing the parent code and all of its direct child concept code as well. One way is to manually include all concept codes within the query but to me this is not a very efficient way. Can you suggest me some other ways as well.</p>",
