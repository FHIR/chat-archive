We're not <em>forcing</em> consistency - it's up to each work group to decide whether they have unique requirements that justifies having a distinct name.  However, we're nudging in that direction where the only reason for distinct names is that the artifacts were created by different groups.  We realize this has an impact on existing implementers, but we're also trying to design for long-term implementation.  When we make these changes for widely implemented artifacts (FMM level 4/5), we do consult with the implementation community first and their opinion is taken into account.  This consistency effort is also working to propagate PractitionerRole everywhere it makes sense too.  You should see that in the version of the resources that comes out in the April ballot.  (And if you're not happy with the changes, you can absolutely share that feedback as a ballot response.</p>",
