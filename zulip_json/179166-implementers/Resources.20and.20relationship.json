Looking at definitions of for example Patient and Observation, it seems to me that you can create an Observation and link it to a Patient only  without involving any ProcedureRequest, DiagnosticReport etc. Is that so? Could any configuration in a FHIR server prohibit that?</p>",

Any simplifier examples on how to solve this?</p>\n<p>// Thomas</p>",
