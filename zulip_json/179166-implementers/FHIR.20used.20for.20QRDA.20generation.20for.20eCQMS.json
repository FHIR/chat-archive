We are having difficulty mapping all the data required in QRDAs to QI Core resources. Certain things are missing. I'm wondering if there has been anyone who has been able to successfully implement FHIR and used the resources to generated the QRDAs? We would like to talk to someone implementing FHIR with the same intention and discuss issues we have found during implementation. Thanks.</p>",

The mappings from QDM to QI-Core are detailed in the QI-Core implementation guide: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/qdm-to-qicore.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/qdm-to-qicore.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/qdm-to-qicore.html</a>, and the mappings from QI-Core to QDM are specified in the Mappings tab of each profile: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/StructureDefinition-qicore-adverseevent-mappings.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/StructureDefinition-qicore-adverseevent-mappings.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/StructureDefinition-qicore-adverseevent-mappings.html</a></p>",
