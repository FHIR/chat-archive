For example, if you have data coming from multiple device sources, it is imperative to ensure at least second level synchronization, if not sub-second.  Obviously, security has similar needs.  Is this simply a policy driven outside of FHIR or are there specific support elements?  I assume it is the former but would love to be surprised! </p>",
