I'm testing the carin bluebutton consumer app (<a href=\"https://github.com/carin-alliance/cpcds-client-ri\">https://github.com/carin-alliance/cpcds-client-ri</a>).  This is a patient launch app that pulls down EOBs from the server and then loops through and calls for a Practitioner resource based on the data in the EOB.  Our FHIR server is throwing a permissions error when the request comes through for the practitioner.  The scopes in the app are currently \"launch patient/Patient.read openid fhirUser\".  I've changed them to patient/*.read.  Given the scopes, should a user be able to request a /Practitioner resource or are additional scopes necessary.  Thanks, Craig</p>",
