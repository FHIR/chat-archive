Stephen Chu made the point that comorbidities are point-in-time and context-specific assessments (e.g., comorbids are different if the admit diagnosis is diabetic ketoacidosis versus heart failure). They suggest looking at either an Observation, List, or QuestionnaireResponse as possible representations.<br>\n•   The concern about Observation was twofold: (1) finding the right Observation.code (almost surely does not exist), and (2) linking the Observation to the Conditions or problem list items (we discussed the possibility of using Observation.focus).  NOTE: If we use Observation, the individual comorbidities could be separate Observations or components of one Observation.<br>\n•   The concern about Questionnaire response is the ability to find and use the information (being \"trapped\" in the QR). My concern is having the yes/no criteria \"buried\" in some prepopulation algorithm.<br>\n•   List was suggested by analogy to Problem list, this could be a comorbidity list. The problem is that List.entry needs to point to another Resource, then the question still, is that item an Observation? the original Condition?<br>\nIn summary, we made some progress but there are numerous questions yet to tackle.</p>",
