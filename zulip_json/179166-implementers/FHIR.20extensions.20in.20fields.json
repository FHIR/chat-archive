Is this related with the resource that allows an extension? Do I have to develop code to get this or is there a way to get it only by extension definition on Forge?<br>\nI've tried profiles too, but then I add the profile to the resource StructureDefinition and I'm still not capable to add the extension at the level I want.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",
