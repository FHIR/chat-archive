If someone have done something similar with spirometry study or different kind of measurements. I have been trying to search a lot for solution but with no luck. Some help would be very much appreciated.</p>",

Because that was what I was planning to do. In actual breath resource I have interpretation telling was the quality normal or was there some \"quality control failure\" such as lazy blow or early termination.  I just cant find suitable field of observation to show reproducibility of breath and not sure about the way of presenting top breaths order. Top order is at the moment presented as numbers in valueString. Feels like it's not the right way to do it.  In addition to that I'm struggling with finding loinc/snomed which would present that the information is about top breaths and their reproducibility. Can't really find any examples of any similar scenarios. Help is very much appreciated! Thanks!</p>",

This isn't a common use case (although obviously a quite legitimate one) so I think that using an extension is a reasonable way to do it.  I think this is also a difficult search to do to look for existing codes that would apply.  So far with what I've tried I didn't find anything related in either LOINC or SNOMED.  I can't say that I'm confident that there couldn't be something there that so far I've missed, but I also have the feeling from prior experience that likely there isn't anything currently for this in either terminology.  We probably would need help from the Regenstrief and SNOMED Int. folks to verify that - and that will happen as a matter of course if new codes for these items are requested.</p>",

I'm still figuring out how to use extension. I have no experience about that yet. I guess I or someone have to define extension somehow? Is that a thing that anyone can do? I guess i found ok snomed codes for 1st, 2nd and 3rd. At the moment I have topbreaths resource where I have just the order of breaths as valueString. I tried to plan extension about their reproducibility. I guess I can just use the text field to tell information about reproducibility. First I was planning to use valueBoolean but component does not accept that and codableConcept has only text option. This extension I made seems to be valid and uploadable to FHIR test server. I use (<a href=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseDstu3/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseDstu3/\">http://hapi.fhir.org/baseDstu3/</a>). Would this be valid way to represent reproducibility with extension?</p>\n<p><code>    \"extension\": [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"http://test.com/fhir/topbreathsandreproducibility\",\n            \"valueCodeableConcept\": {\n                \"coding\": [\n                    {\n                        \"system\": \"http://snomed.info/sct\",\n                        \"code\": \"255216001\",\n                        \"display\": \"First (qualifier value)\"\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"text\": \"Reproducible\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"http://test.com/fhir/topbreathsandreproducibility\",\n            \"valueCodeableConcept\": {\n                \"coding\": [\n                    {\n                        \"system\": \"http://snomed.info/sct\",\n                        \"code\": \"81170007\",\n                        \"display\": \"Second (qualifier value)\"\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"text\": \"Reproducible\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"url\": \"http://test.com/fhir/topbreathsandreproducibility\",\n            \"valueCodeableConcept\": {\n                \"coding\": [\n                    {\n                        \"system\": \"http://snomed.info/sct\",\n                        \"code\": \"70905002\",\n                        \"display\": \"Third (qualifier value)\"\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"text\": \"Not Reproducible\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]</code></p>",
