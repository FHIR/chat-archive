I'm trying to wrap my head around how the CancerGeneticVariant profile can be constrained further to capture specific cancer-related mutations. <br>\nLet's say I want to create a profile that captures METex14 skipping mutation (common in lung cancer). If I understand correctly:<br>\n1) valueCodeableConcept is set as 'positive'<br>\n2) component:geneStudied is set to 'HGNC:7029' (MET)<br>\n3) ... what about the exon 14 skipping part? There are hundreds of distinct genetic alterations (by ClinVar) that would lead to exon14 skipping, figuring out which ones exactly to bind a valueset to the geneStudied or the variationCode components doesn't seem like the right approach. Similarly, using GenomicRegionStudied in the report doesn't seem like the way to go either, since the critical mutation can happen in the adjacent introns as well. </p>\n<p>I guess to generalize this question - how do I use the profile to specify that the mutation has an oncogenic effect (either by describing the mutation type or the effect on the produced protein)? </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191451\">@Patrick Werner</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192302\">@May Terry</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192545\">@Alex Goel</span></p>",
