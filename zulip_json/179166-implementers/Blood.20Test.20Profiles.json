Yes, that makes for a lot of Observations.  However, it provides the freedom to query what data you want without retrieving content that isn't relevant.  It also means that the status for each value is managed independently - if you need to correct one measurement in a panel, you don't need to flag every resource in the panel as corrected.</p>",
