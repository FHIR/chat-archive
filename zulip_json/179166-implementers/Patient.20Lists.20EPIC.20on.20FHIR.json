Does anyone have any suggestions for retrieving these lists of encounters?   The EPIC on FHIR specific version seems to have a lot less flexibility in searching and retrieving patient lists. As an additional workaround we were going to utilize the List (PatientLists) endpoint and configure a custom systemlist for retrieving this data.   Preferably I wanted to see if anyone was able to search encounters with relaxed business rules successfully: Any feedback would be appreciated.</p>",

We just moved to R4 to have more accessibility to extra endpoints but from what I saw available at <a href=\"http://fhir.epic.com\">fhir.epic.com</a> I saw no options to access argonaut etc...  E.g: The allowed options I receive for backend services at the moment is DSTU2/STU3/R4 and that's assuming the specific hospital activated that offering (most are DSTU2 from what I've seen).  I might need to do some more research to make sure I understand it correctly.</p>",

This uses the List resource (please, no discussion on List vs. Group here - we developed List before that whole kerfuffle).  Using Epic's \"List\" based Patient Lists requires some setup.  The health system must identify which system lists they want a client to have access to.  Because there is configuration required, I don't believe we have a great option for testing this in the sandbox.  You can either join the App Orchard program if you need sandbox testing support, or work with a health system to test your List integration in their TST environments.</p>",
