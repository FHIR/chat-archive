I can't set the humanname.nameuse value to a string so I can test what it is.  How do you do that?  I set value properties but .net puts those in and adds objectvalues.  Is there a way to disable that?  I put Identifier values in a list but the document result in Mongodb doesn't have them.  Is that a .net problem or a Mongo problem because I can see them in the C# class?  Sorry to ask such simple questions but search didn't locate anything.</p>",
