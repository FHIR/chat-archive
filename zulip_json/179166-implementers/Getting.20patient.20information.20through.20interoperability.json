Sending and retrieving patient information-<br>\n- What data should be mandatory to be able to consume patient information? Only patient identification ? any other relevant information ?<br>\n- Don't know if you guys can face the following scenario, about a patient changing ID number. We have patients that under 18ys have an id number, but once they get over 18 thresold they will get a new ID number. If so, how do you manage this and data consistency between both systems ?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance, I'll be keen to respond any follow-up question.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Are you looking at using REST, messaging or documents?  In terms of what should be mandatory - you mean to verify patient identity?  That's entirely a policy question.  Answers vary depending on the quality of the identifier and associated information and common business practice.  There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer.  In terms of managing changes to identifier, how do systems handle it now?  Does anyone maintain a mapping between the two identifiers?  DO you just match based on demographics?  FHIR wouldn't be any different.</p>",
