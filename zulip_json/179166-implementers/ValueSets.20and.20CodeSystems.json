I think it would benefit the community to make sure this clear in the documentatrion. Any thoughts?</p>\n<p>Both code systems and valuesets are listed under the same resource type and historically the HL7 codesystems weren't codesystems, they were collections of values.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nJoel</p>",
