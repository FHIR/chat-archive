Since I was working with STU3 all my code is now working perfectly fine with this version of spec, however logic I have implemented is rather universal as it is based on swapping some String values.</p>\n<p>I wrote a message to HAPI mailing list, however this topic seems to be more accurate to FHIR build process itself: <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hapi-fhir/XD3zlZNSaNg\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hapi-fhir/XD3zlZNSaNg\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hapi-fhir/XD3zlZNSaNg</a></p>\n<p>Now, even if my \"business\" logic working with any FHIR resource and its fairly portable the \"processing\" logic, which rely on metadata is not. Are there any reasons why there is no lowest common denominator for Property type as there is support for that in other places?Code reuse across multiple FHIR versions</p>",
