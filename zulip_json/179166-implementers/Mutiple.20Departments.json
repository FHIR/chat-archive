Location is relevant if you care about the physical place.  E.g. \"Where's the patient right now?\" - \"They got transferred to Cardiology an hour ago\".  Organization is used if you're talking about people and responsibility.  E.g. \"Dr. Smith is currently assigned to Cardiology\".  HealthcareService is about what capabilities are offered.  E.g. \"Good Health Clinic offers Cardiology, Diagnostic Imaging and basic Laboratory\"</p>",
