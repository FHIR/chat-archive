They make perfect sense in the context of measurements (say <code>code</code> LAB123, value <code>Negative</code>) however in the context of social history it is a bit confusing. If I wish to document smoking history (e.g. Current vs Former) should I fill in <code>code</code>: \"Smoking Status\", <code>valueCodeableConcept</code>: \"Former\" or should I do <code>code</code>: \"Former smoker\" and leave <code>valueCodeableConcept</code> blank?</p>\n<p>Anyone have any best practices?</p>",
