One possible solution I am thinking is that instead of patch, read the resource again, apply the changed fields on the read resource, apply bundle PUT with setIfMatch (conditional version). Is this ok ofcourse this has a penalty of reading the resource. Are there any other alternatives ?. Can you please kindly suggest. thanks for your kind help.</p>",
