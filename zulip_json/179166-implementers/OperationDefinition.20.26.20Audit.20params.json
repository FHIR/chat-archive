For example, querying for a patient on a given identifier, but auditing who made the request and when. So the only \"real\" query paramenter is the Patient.identifer, but I want to audit Device.identifier (or Parctitioner.identifier), and the dateTime of the request. Is there a Parameter.type I can use to identify the audit parameters?</p>",
