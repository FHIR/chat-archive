In order to execute conformance tests, for ease of availability for colleagues and for showcasing special functionality, I run a public available test instance. There are other well known public available test instances. Now my question:</p>\n<p>What happens if someone uploads real, identifiable patient data to my server? I (or my organization) will automatically share this GDPR relevant data. My server sits in Germany, so GDPR is relevant to me.</p>\n<p>Firely has a public endpoint under <a href=\"https://vonk.fire.ly\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://vonk.fire.ly\">https://vonk.fire.ly</a>. There they ship a HTML page saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is an open FHIR endpoint for testing and educational purposes only. Uploading real personal data is strictly prohibited.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is that sufficient?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://test.fhir.org/r4\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://test.fhir.org/r4\">http://test.fhir.org/r4</a> doesn't say anything regarding uploading real data.<br>\n<a href=\"http://hapi.fhir.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hapi.fhir.org\">http://hapi.fhir.org</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is not a production server!  Do not store any information here that contains personal health information or any other confidential information. This server will be regularly purged and reloaded with fixed test data.</p>\n</blockquote>",

(In practice, there could be licensing restrictions that would prevent you from posting purely synthetic data.)  So long as it's clear to a reasonable person that the server is open and public, the only reasonable responsibility you might have is to allow deletion of data that was posted inappropriately.  This would probably need to be a full purge rather than just a normal 'delete' which would retain history.  That said, I'm not a lawyer...</p>",

If you do regular deletion or anonymisation, you should also state that, as safeguards. The initial notice \"please do not store personal data here\" also counts as a safeguard IMO</p>",
