Josh discussed trying to align the ResearchStudy resource with the representation used by <a href=\"http://ClinicalTrials.gov\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ClinicalTrials.gov\">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>; <a href=\"http://ct.gov\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ct.gov\">ct.gov</a> uses discrete terms for condition and intervention; the ResearchStudy bundles all of the above under the focus attribute (my level of understanding is still not strong enough to establish that it would be flexible enough). </p>\n<p>Is your UK colleague in a position to discuss this with me?  I'm interested to know who would be the broker for this information as it's multi-modal;  sponsors maintain lists of studies they are running (often on their websites), CROs have a service they offer to sponsors to recruit subjects (through research networks, advertising, etc) and technology vendors like ourselves might consider it as a value add for our customers.</p>",

But I think for this use-case, you wouldn't want ClinicalStudy.focus.  All that would say is \"this study focuses on breast cancer and drug XYZ\".  It might help to be able to find \"breast cancer-related studies\", but you'd then need to drill down to the Group referenced by the study that defines the eligibility criteria and evaluate the patient against those criteria.</p>",

You could propose allowing group criteria to nest to allow coordinating criteria, but it's not clear that level of sophistication would fall within the 80%.  I think specifying high-level computable criteria that significantly narrow down the possible trials and then a few detailed non-computable criteria is probably more realistic for what we could get most systems to accomplish.  That said, extensions are definitely an option within a controlled community.</p>",

One main issue is of course to get structured eligibility and location data for clinical trials; at least geodata is straightforward. The other main issue then is the logic when comparing eligibility criteria to data obtained about the patient, as was already brought up: SNOMED post-coordination vs. related resources (like a mutation Observation on a Condition). There's apparently a reason people invented things like Arden Syntax. ;)</p>\n<p>Has somebody started to model a couple of actual studies as <code>ResearchStudy</code> and a handful of potential and not-so-potential participants as patients? We do have 100 synthetic but realistic breast cancer patients (they are in the SMART sandbox) and I have access to a dozen or so studies in the breast cancer realm that we could model and test.</p>",

This would be really interesting for <code>enlightened</code> doctors who would like to see the results of the clinical studies that contributed to the marketing approval for a interventional product, assuming that fhir is being used for Physician portals already in play.  Again, it would be advantageous if there is reasonable concept alignment to the <a href=\"http://CT.gov\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://CT.gov\">CT.gov</a> model.  Just my thoughts.</p>",
