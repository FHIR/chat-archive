For example, Observation has an element subject, which is a reference to one of a number of types. This has a matching search parameter subject, which refers to any of the possible types. In addition to this, there is another search parameter patient, which also refers to Observation.subject, but is limited to only include references of type Patient. When using the patient search parameter, there is no need to specify \":Patient\" as a modifier, or \"Patient/\" in the search value, as this must always be true.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the definition seems to be wrong on <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/deviceusestatement.html#search\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/deviceusestatement.html#search\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/deviceusestatement.html#search</a>, where it isn't restricting subject by type, which allows both <code>Patient</code> and <code>Group</code>. </p>\n<p>Is this correct?</p>",
