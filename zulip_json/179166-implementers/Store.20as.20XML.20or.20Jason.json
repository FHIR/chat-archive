Every message and operation I throw at it seems to work.  Two questions:   Is this a bad idea to do or should we be looking to adopt a schema like FHIRBASE, where there is a table for each resource<br>\n?    <br>\n And this table, although Mirth accepts JSON and XML, stores the message as XML.   Is there a disadvantage to this or would storing the JSON be preferred?</p>",

Storing resources as a blob is a very viable strategy when the only interface accessing the data will be FHIR-based.  On the other hand, if you need to perform ad-hoc query and analysis or need to expose the data over other types of interfaces, it may not work well.
