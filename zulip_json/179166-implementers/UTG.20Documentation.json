Please make sure you are accessing UTG from the current build as Version 1.0.0 (<a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org\">terminology.hl7.org</a>) was a prototype to debug the content, process and tooling. The content there is insufficient and should be consumed with that in mind.</p>\n<p>Currently the UTG Jira project is focused on recording and shepherding HL7 terminology content changes through consensus review. Its use will be extended to include the workflow to record and resolve requests for changes to the supporting content on <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org\">terminology.hl7.org</a>.</p>\n<p>I apologize if you have seen this message on other streams. It has been requested in each location for transparency.</p>",
