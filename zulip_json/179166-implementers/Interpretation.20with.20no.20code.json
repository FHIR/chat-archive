We have text box for free text for interpretation in our software and I need some place in observation to store that. Like this:<br>\n<code>\"interpretation\": {\n    \"text\": \"text field of the Interpretation\"\n}</code></p>\n<p>Edit:<br>\nOr could it be something like this:<br>\n<code>  \"interpretation\": [\n    {\n      \"coding\": [\n        {\n          \"system\": \"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationInterpretation\",\n        }\n      ],\n      \"text\": \"text field of the Interpretation\"\n    }\n  ]</code><br>\nThere is no suitable code/display for free text. Help/opinion would be very much appreciated :)</p>",
