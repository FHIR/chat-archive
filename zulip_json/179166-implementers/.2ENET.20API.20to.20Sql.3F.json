Some throw the entire resource into a blob and have a separate table of index terms.  Some store json fragments for non-queriable bits.  Some are driven by legacy.  Some break things down based on a profile.  Because of that variance, a general purpose tool like the reference implementation can't generate queries - it won't know what the data model is.   To get that, you'd actually need to use a full open source server - which has the persistence layer defined.</p>",
