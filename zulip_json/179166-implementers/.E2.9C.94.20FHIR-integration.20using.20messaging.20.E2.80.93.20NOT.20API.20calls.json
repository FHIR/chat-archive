We sync data from our EHR (which does not speak FHIR yet) to HealthCloud (Salesforce) via FHIR resources. OfCourse there is transformation involved from EHR -&gt; FHIR -&gt; HealthCloud but we are doing EHR -&gt; FHIR already for other applications so we leveraged the same canonical model to supply data to HealthCloud. We transmit to the volume of 20M- 40M messages per day and we use kafka for the streaming. We have been in production for over 4 years and have had no issues. Notice that we are on STU3 currently.</p>",
