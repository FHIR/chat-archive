        "content": "<p>I am copying here some relevant messages from the email thread on this in IEEE PHD / PCHA:</p>\n<p>The actual problem is that the FHIR base spec is requiring LOINC for Vital Signs. That is the only requirement the base spec is making for the case we are concerned about. What should be happening instead is that coding schemes are mandated in profiles.</p>\n<p>Right now the PCHA profiles are requiring 11073 10101 codes (since they are provided by the device) and allowing translations to any other coding system as desired. Unfortunately the current FHIR spec requires that I add to this profile that if a vital sign, I have to mandate a translation to LOINC as well as the 11073 code in order to be FHIR compliant.</p>\n<p>Brian Reinhold, LNI<br>\n===<br>\nThis requirement should go wider, as many countries that have adopted other coding schemes, such as SNOMED, will also not want to follow a mandated LOINC encoding. It appears US centric - there should not be a mandated coding in a message protocol of this type, as it will be completely geographic or organisation specific.<br>\nRegards</p>\n<p>Malcolm Clarke, Brunel<br>\n===<br>\nI agree with Brian’s comment about profiling.

It might help to note that 11073 Nomenclatures include the general standard, 10101, as amended (10101a with 10101b well along the way); 10102 (Annotated ECG); 10103 (Implantable Cardiac Devices); as well as a number of subsets in the 104xx-series related to Personal Health Devices [PHD]; most of these are approved IEEE and ISO standards.</p>\n<p>In general, I don't see the advantage to a general methodology like FHIR to restrict semantic scope and see a lot of potential advantage to facilitating growth of application scopes, esp, w.r.t. specialized medical device nomenclature/semantics.  In addition, there have been LOINC-11073 nomenclature harmonization activities ongoing for some time and expected in future to facilitate pre-coordination of common semantics for applications that can avail of higher-use subsets where semantic equivalence is beneficial.</p>\n<p>Please keep us posted on progress.</p>\n<p>Best regards,  /Jan Wittenber (IEEE PoCD chair)<br>\n===</p>\n<p>Hello all</p>\n<p>I share this concern.  In particular the use of LOINC requires acceptance of a Regenstrief Licence which is permissive with caveats.

The agreement in all domains in 2016 was to use the PCHA / Continua guidelines, to collect values from mobile and home devices. IHE XDS with CDA payloads (HL7 CDA personal healthcare Monitoring report PHMR, uses 11073 nomenclature as well) was then agreed as a useful means to receive the data in the healthcare provider space. Everybody is now waiting for the missing link, FHIR, to connect mobile devices into the server space. Based on this available and proven standards landscape, there is strong (political) motivation to implement, and large investments are on the move in Austria and elsewhere. <br>\nThe IEEE codes are an integral part of these concepts, agreed between the relevant SDOs ISO, CEN, IHE, HL7, and PCHA. We have strong implementer agreement and experience that the IEEE 11073 nomenclature covers the requirements. The choice to confirm IEEE 11073 nomenclature for telemonitoring vitals signs in Austria considered experience with LOINC from our work on the CDA laboratory report implementation guide in the context of the Austrian national EHR (ELGA).<br>\nLOINC as the only mandated nomenclature, and only allowing IEEE 11073 terms as mappings is a severe change in a substantial and well agreed long term position.

In PCHA PHD profiles, the IEEE coding system is used as it is provided by the device reducing the need and size of code  dictionaries on the collector and FHIR encoder. Readers of PCHA PHD profiles will need an IEEE dictionary so in all cases IEEE codes are placed first in any coding element if the IEEE code exists. So the reader can look at entry[0] and not go further. However, for those 'extensible' codes, like the productionSpecification in the DeviceComponent (which shows how the IEEE codes map to the specified coding system), the encoder will have to carry both. That may not be a big deal in enterprises but it is in remote patient monitoring where low cost embedded chips for collector units are sometimes needed and upload bandwidth is a cost issue.</p>",

To deal with this in the PCHA PHD profiles I require that the IEEE code is placed in the first 'coding' element, and if a vital signs, the LOINC code for that vital sign (as specified in FHIR) is put in the second, and any alternative codes are placed in subsequent elements (recall a coding element has  a [0..*]  cardinality so it makes a JSON array, for example).<br>\nThe LOINC code is specified by FHIR, so if the vital signs is a pulse rate, it is always of value X (I don't recall what it is and I am too lazy to look it up). However the IEEE code will indicate that the pulse rate may be from an ECG, Blood Pressure Cuff, pulse ox, or cardio device all of which may have different LOINC codes. THose LOINC codes are not used here, only the fixed value X.

I am just quoting the PCHA philosophy because it is working in a consumer market and sensors devices, collectors, and the cost of bandwidth come out of consumer pockets which make it much more cost-sensitive. Thus the push 'downstream'. There is also future-proofing here. As one could have 1000s of devices being serviced by 100's of remotely scattered collectors sending to a single server. If a new device comes out reporting a vital sign using a new technique (such as a continuous BPM) the existing collectors will not be able to map this to LOINC since it is not in its dictionary. However, the IEEE code is provided by the sensor. So it will work and upload but the LOINC code will be missing. A system update will be needed to fix all the collectors. That puts more demands on the embedded collector.</p>",

Devices use them because they take only two or four bytes. I suppose that's why PCHA is using them as they are reporting device data. Maybe behind all of this is an ulterior motive from the device community to get HL7 to fully accept the IEEE device codes. But if you think the downstream coding issue is a nightmare you haven't seen anything until you look at the nightmare of getting the sensor devices to behave in a standardized manner. In the field device to collector communication has been a far greater nightmare than any reading of the downstream data. Fixing the latter part is always relatively easy. Better than that is fixable.  Fixing the first stage is not easy. In the end requiring the LOINC codes in the spec is probably more against philosophy (it should be done in profiles and not the base spec) but it is doable. Yes it will cost more for the uploader and it may cause future interoperability problems. But compared to the interoperability issues between the collector and device it's a drop in the bucket. I spend 95% of my time trying to figure out why the device-to-collector exchanges don't work right. When I mess up on the FHIR side its usually \"oops! I can fix that\" and its done.</p>",

The question is where. Low level communications like Bluetooth and ZigBee are complex and often involve many parts from the radio to a low level stack and an application layer. All of that has to be done correctly on both sides. In the end one side ends up not implementing the standard correctly and if it is in the device one has to work around it which may not be possible.<br>\nBut to answer your question it is invariably code. It's just that code exists at many levels and one may not always have access to it. I can give you countless cases of where devices and collector platforms have incorrectly implemented the specifications and you can't fix it because it is out of your control. If life it good, you find a work around in your application layer. Unfortunately, life is not always good.</p>",

Wherever it's done, preparing the data to submit directly to a FHIR interface will require some overhead, and it seems that the additional overhead of including the LOINC codes  in that context would be pretty minimal.

I make a dictionary of all the IEEE codes that are vital signs (this is a many to one mapping) and when they show up I add the LOINC code to the 'coding' element. The main issue I have here is that if a new specialization is created (such as the continuous Blood Pressure monitor) I will have new set of codes that need to be mapped to that set of  LOINC codes. The IEEE codes are provided by the device, but the LOINC codes are not and my dictionary does not know about these codes. This will require updates of all the collectors in the field.

This allows devices to skip partitions on the wire when the partition can be implied by context. For example, partition 4 is dimensions (units). So Unit code values are sent in two bytes and not four. There are not many partitions. Something like 8. There is a partition for disease management, health and fitness, independent living, dimensions, object, etc. In the end in the PHD profiles, I use the 32 bit values across the board (the same is true in V2 messaging).

They are NOT sent on the wire from the device. That would be far too costly. IEEE is designed to be extensible so a future specialization using new codes (unknown to the collector) could still upload and encode them into FHIR. If ref ids were required, that could not be done. Clearly the reader would have to know what the code means, so the reader will have to understand the latest codes to understand the latest device measurements.</p>",

It's bad practice to depend on codings in FHIR being in any particular position in a FHIR instance.  There's no meaning to the order of the codings.  Forcing systems to spit out codings in a particular order just means that systems will have to write custom interfaces for each receiver who demands a different ordering even though they're conveying exactly the same information.  (If you require IEEE is first and someone else requires LOINC first and someone else requires SNOMED first - that's 3 interfaces and that will get worse the more attribute combinations considered.)  The tiny gain in efficiency from not having to check the system of each coding to find the one you want rarely outweighs the large (and ongoing) cost of developing, testing and maintaining multiple interfaces for all of the communication partners.  Best practice is for instance creators to populate codings (and any other repeating element where the order of repetitions is meaningless) in whatever order they choose and for the receiver to extract the repetition that's relevant to them by looking at data in the instance (in this case the Coding.system).</p>",

I had even though of adding a coding element entry that told what kind of data type the measurement was (Quantity, code, string) so the reader would not have to search through the possible data types to find out what the measurement type is. But I didn't do that though I implemented it and use it in my reader ... I am a lazy coder.</p>\n<p>Of course, the reader would only know that it could do that because it sees that the Observation.meta.profile is set to the PCHA PHD profile. Isn't that the idea of a profile? You restrict/constrain the possible behaviors to simplify the implementation? To the uploader its certainly not a problem. The only coding required is the 11073 code unless FHIR requires additional. Of course the application can add whatever additional codings it wants. If someone else wants to require SNOMED first, that would be fine but they would have to do that in their own profile. It would not be complaint with the PCHA PHD profile and should not indicate that in the meta.profile element. I cannot see how this differs in any way from any of the other restrictions one places in a profile.

It would not need to take advantage of any ordering or profile information (which would also tell it what data type the value is without trying different types). However, a reader that does understand the profile can work a little less. The only thing that is limiting interoperability is the coding system. If the reader is looking for SNOMED codes it may find them or it may not. That depends upon the implementation sourcing the data. But it will find MDC codes. So that is really the only requirement placed upon the reader for guaranteed interoperability. Right now the profile does not require any extensions which makes it even more generically interoperable. If there were one and only one coding system the uploaded data would be readable by any reader that can understand elements of the base FHIR specification. I don't see how requiring that ordering be done by the uploader affects interoperability. I can see that using only a certain coding system affects interoperability!</p>",

They shouldn't have to do that.  They should be able to spit out the codes they know in any order they wish.  And all readers then look through the list to see what they care about.  The impact on interoperability is that if your reader requires IEEE first and some other profile requires SNOMED first and some other profile requires LOINC first, then the author must write 3 interfaces.  <em>That</em> is an interoperability problem - because you just tripled maintenance costs for the authoring system.

IU and USP units are used to quantify vitamins, hormones, some medications, vaccines, blood products, and other biologically active substances. Although the meaning of IU and USP units differs from substance to substance, comparisons to the underlying WHO or USP reference preparation can be made, facilitating interoperability across multiple institutions. In contrast, arbitrary units [arb’U] contain an arbitrary scale factor and preclude any meaningful comparison across multiple institutions (although comparability within a given institution may be possible).</p>\n<p><strong>{delta}Cel - this is gramatically invalid - could be Cel{delta}</strong><br>\n{delta} is a unitless UCUM annotation and several IHE PCD vendors preferred retaining it for human-reader clarity.  In general, the observation identifier(s) the use this unit include the concept of a temperature difference.</p>\n<p><strong>dB[10.nV]</strong><br>\nThis was added to UCUM several years ago as a way of expressing the 0dB reference level that was not a simple prefixed power of ten.  In this instance, the 0dB level is with respect to 10 nV, and is used as a logarithmic unit of measure for EEG amplitude.  The essential idea here is that the square braces [...] enclose a UCUM value that may include an integer scale factor, e.g. '10.' to obtain a 10.nV reference level.  This can apply to any measurement that uses a logarithmic representation, e.g. EEG, acoustic, electromagnetic field strength, ionizing radiation, etc.</p>\n<p>Also, I recommend that you apply your UCUM validator to the harmonized Rosetta (hRTM) terms on the NIST RTMMS - they have been carefully vetted  (with the exception of the 'day' instead of 'd' error that you found).  If you have any other questions about the NIST RTMMS and the IEEE 11073-10101* nomenclatures in general, I would be happy to answer them.</p>\n<p>Thanks and regards,</p>\n<p>Paul Schluter</p>",

From a higher level perspective, supporting [arb'U] allows us to express an arbitrary scale factor and strictly reserve the use of [iU] where meaningful comparison across multiple institutions (and algorithms) is required.  I believe this is what Gunther and his colleagues had in mind when they originally  defined [arb'U] and this view was endorsed by the IHE PCD infusion pump working group and was successfully balloted as part of an ISO/IEEE 11073-10101a standard.

There are many prevailing use cases for vital signs data across many domains, and having device-produced data identified in a different way that data captured natively in the EHR (or elsewhere) seems less than ideal. Adding the MDC code as an additional code to the LOINC code specified in the profile seems to me the way to go. </p>\n<p>Specifically regarding the U.S. mentions...the ISA is not a regulatory document, but more of an \"index\" of standards. It currently lists both LOINC and IEEE as vocab standards for vitals (<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/isa/Representing_Patient_Vital_Signs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.healthit.gov/isa/Representing_Patient_Vital_Signs\">https://www.healthit.gov/isa/Representing_Patient_Vital_Signs</a>) with noted differences in the characterizing attributes, such as that LOINC is federally required in some contexts. E.g. LOINC is the required coding system for vitals in the Common Clinical Data Set as specified in the 2015 Certification Criteria. C-CDA vital signs entry templates require LOINC too.</p>",
