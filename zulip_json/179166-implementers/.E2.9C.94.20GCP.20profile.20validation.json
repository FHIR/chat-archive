(Is this strictly necessary? I'd assumed it not to be.)</p>\n<p>I've created a simple Patient profile that requires a patient's gender, I mapped this profile in the global field in the implementation guide.</p>\n<p>The implementation guide has been enabled for the endpoint as well, via the updateMask-validationConfig PATH command.</p>\n<p>Now, when I upload a Patient resource without a gender I'd expect to see an error, but I do not, the Patient is marked as being entirely valid:</p>\n<p>\"issue\": [<br>\n    {<br>\n      \"code\": \"informational\",<br>\n      \"details\": {<br>\n        \"text\": \"success\"<br>\n      },<br>\n      \"diagnostics\": \"success\",<br>\n      \"severity\": \"information\"<br>\n    }<br>\n  ],</p>\n<p>Any idea of what I'm missing?</p>",
