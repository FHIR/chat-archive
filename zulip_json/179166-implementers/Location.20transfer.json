You either have one encounter where the location changes (in the case of the transfer), or two encounters, one that goes \"onleave\", and a second that is created at the target facility.</p>\n<p>In the onleave/discharge -&gt; admit scenario, you do have to deal with discontinuing/re-ordering everything (diet/med orders, etc.) of course, but I think that is outside the scope of what you are asking about?</p>",
