There would be a batch process at provider end which would transmit this data once per day and we will receive it via API<br>\n2.Provider would send every case via API in real time. We will have a service that listens to this API and pull the data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provider would send the data via API to a shared/FTP path. We will have a service that pulls the data from this folder for further processing.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, would like to confirm that we will be receiving data from multiple facilities and therefore, wondering if anyone has implemented with any specific architecture .<br>\nAny inputs are helpful. Thanks!</p>",

        "content": "<p>It's not that it's not being used \"anymore\", it's that it's not necessarily being used very much yet - and in the U.S. it's unlikely to get used at all due to regulatory issues which mandate that the vast bulk of claims in the U.S. are submitted using X12 and NCPDP.  Even if implementers might prefer to move to FHIR for claims submission, they can't.  There's some work to allow the use of FHIR Claim for prior authorization in the U.S., though even then there's an expectation that X12 would be in the middle somewhere.  (Do a search for Da Vinci Prior Authorization Support.)</p>",
