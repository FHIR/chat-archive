Should an identifier for any resource be unique within that resource for a FHIR repository?  I am not asking about the resource id.  I am asking about the type of identifier (2.24.0.12)which is described as \"The value SHALL be unique within the defined system...\"  I have understood this to mean that any identifier for a resource- for Patient: a medical record number, a drivers license as examples- must be a unique identifier that matches (with the system and possibly period or other ameliorating properties) to one and only one resource.  Is this true?</p>",

On the other hand, something like medical license number might not be - because there might be multiple PractitionerRole instances that correspond to the same individual (with different roles and/or time-periods).</p>",
