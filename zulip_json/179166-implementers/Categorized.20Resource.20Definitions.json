They came back with the question: \"Is there a place that I can find the definitions of the Resource Categories\".  I have this memory of having read them at some point, but I can't seem to locate the definitions.</p>\n<p>Here is the page I am referring to: <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html</a></p>\n<p>Any help locating the resource category definitions used would be quite helpful!</p>\n<p>Example:   Base, Specialized, Financial, Clinical</p>",
