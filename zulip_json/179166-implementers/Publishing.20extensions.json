        "content": "<p>Hello, <br>\nThere a number of extensions I had to create for my DSTU2 FHIR profiles that we are providing to a 3rd party vendor that will send us data.  Some of them are actually elements in release 3 that weren't in DSTU2 that we needed.  The others are for data that did not have any existing elements. I need to publish these extensions but am wondering what is the recommended way to do this.  </p>\n<p>I pasted content from <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/defining-extensions.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/defining-extensions.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/defining-extensions.html</a> below and I don't see where it gives instructions on where to go for the \"second registry\" that they encourage. <br>\nBefore extensions can be used in instances, their definition SHALL be published. HL7 maintains two extension registries: <br>\n1.HL7 approved extensions, approved by an appropriate part of the HL7 community following a review process, and which have formal standing<br>\n2.Provided as a service to the community, where anyone can register an extension<br>\nUsers are encouraged to register their extensions in the second registry, though this is not required. All that is required is that the extension is published in a context that is available for users of the extension. So, for example, if a particular extension is only used within a single institution, the definition of the extension can be placed on the institution's intranet. However since, by their nature, resources tend to travel well, it's always better to use the HL7 or other publicly accessible extension registries. </p>\n<p>The HL7 FHIR registry can be found at <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/registry\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/registry\">http://hl7.org/fhir/registry</a> . </p>\n<p>Thank You!<br>\nSylvia</p>",

I actually already had a <a href=\"http://Simplifier.net\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Simplifier.net\">Simplifier.net</a> account and had uploaded my extensions to my project as drafts.  The canonical field just contains \"StructureDefinition/extCyclesAndDays\" for example.  I thought the canonical URL was supposed to be something like  \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/birthPlace\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/birthPlace\">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/birthPlace</a>\".   Can you help me with the steps I need to take to publish my extension so it can have the proper canonical URL?  Thank You! Sylvia</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196284\">@Sylvia Freeman</span>, a <code>StructureDefinition</code> should always specify a unique, fully qualified, absolute canonical url, assigned by the author.  Simplifier will accept invalid resources with publication status Draft. However if you try to publish a resource with status Active, then Simplifier will make sure it is valid and also enforce a unique canonical url, and otherwise reject it.<br>\nA canonical url should start with a domain that is controlled by the organization that is responsible for authoring the profile. The <code>hl7.org</code> domain is reserved for official publications by HL7, so you might want to reconsider using another domain prefix.<br>\nHope this helps, feel free to contact us if you need any more assistance.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196284\">@Sylvia Freeman</span>, most importantly, choose a domain under your control. When publishing profiles to e.g. <a href=\"https://simplifier.net\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://simplifier.net\">https://simplifier.net</a>, you can claim your organizations url to make sure that nobody outside of your organization can publish profiles on Simplifier with a url that is based on your domain. This ensures uniqueness.<br>\nFHIR only requires canonical urls to be unique. FHIR does not require you to actually publish your profiles online to the associated canonical url. However if you control the domain, then FHIR encourages you to serve a web page on a profile url describing the profile,  as this is convenient for implementers. Just like core profiles such as <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/patient\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/patient\">http://hl7.org/fhir/patient</a>.</p>",
