Is it a best practice to always include this in meta-tag? How should one set this tag? I can't do it when I do profiling in Forge. I am only able to do that in a texteditor. I hope someone can clarify this for me.</p>",

The Options menu provides a configuration setting \"Show common resource elements\" that controls this behavior.<br>\nNote that the .meta.profile element represents a profile <em>claim</em> on a resource instance. In other words, this states that the instance claims to conform to the referenced profile. However this is just a claim and should always be verified (by a FHIR server).<br>\nIf you want to constrain your server to only accept resources that conform to a specific (set of) profiles, then your server can advertise this behavior by means of the server CapabilityStatement.</p>",
