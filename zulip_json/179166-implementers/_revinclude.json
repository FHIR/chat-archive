But I cannot find any test server to test _revinclude. <br>\nI would like to ask whether what I understand is correct, and any test server to test _revinclude with sample queries.<br>\nThank you in advance<br>\nBest<br>\nJoonggeon Lee</p>",

I believe the <a href=\"http://healthintersections.com.au\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://healthintersections.com.au\">healthintersections.com.au</a> server works (be sure you're testing the STU 3 version).  That said, the query you're making is a dangerous one.  A given patient may have thousands or tens of thousands of observations.  So if you execute the search and set a page size of 50 patients, you could easily get back 500k Observations in your first page.  (And you may find that some servers will therefore refuse to perform the query)</p>",
