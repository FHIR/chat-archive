For fetus we do not want to exchange a Patient resource that early, that could easily mess up patient tables in EHR's. If we put the mother in FamilyMemberHistory .patient (and add a father somewhere) we'd have to rewrite the entire history - what's recorded as 'maternal grandmother' (of the fetus) in the Birthcare record would become 'mother' in FamilyMemberHistory  etc. Very messy. Anyone solved this problem?</p>",
