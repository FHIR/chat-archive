I'm working with the Furore folk to integrate that with simplifier, so that you can save a profile there, then create the sample resources based on that profile. It's open source, so if you want to participate (it's an angular JS app) just let me know.</p>",

We're currently building an AngularJS Lab Order entry system and our own FHIR server (learned a lot from the Spark server).
