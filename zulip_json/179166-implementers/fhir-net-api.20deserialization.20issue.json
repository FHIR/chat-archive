I get an error \"Literal ActivityDefinition is not a valid value for enumeration ResourceType\". It seems that ActivityDefinition is not defined in the fhir-net-api's ResourceType enumeration. Does anyone know if this is just something new in FHIR STU3 that the fhir-net-api hasn't accounted for, yet? Or am I just doing something wrong?</p>",
