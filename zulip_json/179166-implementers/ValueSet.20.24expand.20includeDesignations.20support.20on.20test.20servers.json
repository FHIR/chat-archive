I think it's getting more important now that more and more non-English speaking countries are starting to actually use FHIR for production systems.<br>\nAt least in Germany, I think we're just about to see an explosion of the number of such systems within the next 24 months. So the reference implementations should be ready by then. People start asking questions like \"if it's in the spec, why can't I test it anywhere?\" ;-)</p>",
