I am trying to extract only the MedicationStatement  List, how would that work in .NET? Currently I am just iterating through the whole bundle of lists for a specific patient and checking whether the list contains an entry of MedicationStatement type, but I am sure there is a more direct way to query only for that type of list. Thank you in advance.</p>",

For this, you can use a chained search (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/search.html#chaining\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/search.html#chaining\">http://hl7.org/fhir/search.html#chaining</a>):</p>\n<p><code>http://myserver.org/fhir/List?subject=xxxxxx&amp;item._type=MedicationStatement</code></p>\n<p>Although I have never seen this before, and I wonder whether servers implement it.</p>\n<p>I would try it out using Postman on several servers - and when you get it to work, it is trivial to run the search using the .NET client.</p>",
