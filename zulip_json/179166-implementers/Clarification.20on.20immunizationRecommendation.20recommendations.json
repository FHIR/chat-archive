So sometimes the recommendation may be relative to a date in the past. So even though today is Feb 16th, it's possible (with some systems) to ask for a set of the recommendations for a patient as of Jan 1 (given the patient history up to that date). In this case the \"future\" recommendation may actually be in the past if they were due for something between Jan 1 and Feb 16. Hope that makes sense.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I'll also add that often the forecast is just for the next dose in the series and not all future doses. The reason is that the interval between the first forecasted dose and the second forecasted dose is usually dependent on when the first dose is actually given. For COVID, you could forecast dose 1 on Jan 10 and dose 2 on Jan 31 (assuming a 3 week interval) but if dose 1 is actually given on Jan 12, then the due data on dose 2 then changes from Jan 31 to Feb 2 (because the 3 week interval still needs to be enforced). So while ImmunizationRecommendation doesn't preclude multiple forecasted doses in a single series, in practice it may not happen a lot.</p>",

For example, one resource could contain recommendations for both COVID and Influenza if the patient is due for both, but the COVID recommendation would only be for the first dose (assuming they haven't had any doses yet). Then once any due vaccines have been given, a new set of recommendations based on the updated patient history could be generated which would then no longer recommend Influenza (or at worst recommend it for 1 year or so in the future) and the second dose of COVID in 3 or 4 weeks. I always assumed that this new set of recommendations would be a different instance of ImmunizationRecommendations, but I don't know enough about how resources are versioned in the real world to know whether or not systems would update the instance or create a second resource.</p>",
