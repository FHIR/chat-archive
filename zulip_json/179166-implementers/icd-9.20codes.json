        "content": "<p>It is a little complicated, and, at least, as Josh said, I don't think we're explaining it very well in FHIR.  So, as briefly as I can,  this is what it is (at least my take).  ICD-9-CM is published in 3 volumes.  The first two volumes are for diagnosis, with volume 1 being the tabular representation (the actual code system section for diagnosis) and volume 2 being the alpha index (both assisting in navigation and providing some guidance/rules for coding - including at least some of the cases where multiple codes are required).  The diagnosis codes were used for both provider and facility (hospital) billing in the US (now superceded by ICD-10-CM).  Volume 3 is the ICD-9-CM procedure codes, including both the tabular representation and alpha index, which were used only for hospital (facility) procedure billing in the US (provider procedure billing uses CPT).  In my opinion, ICD-9-CM is a single code system (at least the codes are unique across all 3 volumes), but which has this primary division of diagnosis and procedure - and that is what we see with the URL's that have been defined.  Probably what we really should have, though, is the single URL for the code system ( <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-9-cm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-9-cm\">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-9-cm</a>), with the diagnosis and procedure codes sections both defined as value sets (which don't seem to exist at present in FHIR).</p>",
