The contrast product information says it is not advised in case of nephropathy.<br>\nBefore the procedure, the technician identifies the patient and the drug, and the system consults another system which says \"warning - this is not advised for patients with poor kidney function\".<br>\nThe patient may well end up getting the contrast, regardless of the computer-issued advice.<br>\nWhat is the resource that conveys that response with the contraindications or precautions or warnings for this patient? <br>\nIt can be a special flavour of \"do not give\" because that is the suggestion from the computer. But it is not really \"do not give\" but \"be aware that this should be used with caution\".</p>",
