Historically our client has used SNOMED CT codes for recording blood pressure in its EHR system, however, the FHIR standard appears to use LOINC codes for observation.code (CodeableConcept) field. Is LOINC \"bound\" and/or \"required\" as the reference set for observation.code or can it be customized based on data mapping needs?</p>\n<p>When looking at the blood pressure example on the FHIR site (<a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-example-bloodpressure.json.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-example-bloodpressure.json.html\">http://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-example-bloodpressure.json.html</a>), it appears that via observation.component.code.coding you can specify multiple coding systems.</p>\n<p>Based on this JSON for observation.component.code.coding (CodeableConcept), I expect it is possible to do something similar via. observation.code.coding (CodeableConcept).</p>\n<p>Is this a correct assumption or no? If not, can you please provide an example for me that would be more appropriate here?</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nLauren</p>",

However, in STU 3, FHIR has introduced a mandatory vital signs profile for a small set of observations.  Diastolic ans Systolic blood pressure fall within that profile.  Systems that capture such data using Observation <em>must</em> send one of the specified LOINC codes if they're sending information of this type if they want to be FHIR conformant.  However, they're free to send a SNOMED code as well - i.e. multiple codings within the Observation.code CodeableConcept.</p>",
