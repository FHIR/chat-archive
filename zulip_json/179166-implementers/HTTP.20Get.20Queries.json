The tester overlay is a good resource to use if you are trying to determine which fields a resource has, it will also show you the responses, URL, and client code.  If you want to upload bundles or perform any of the other http operations you will need something like Postman (chrome),  ARC (chrome),  or Rest client (Firefox), there are also a lot of 3rd party products you could use like Soapui, in order to modify headers and create the bodies you wish to post.</p>\n<p>The best reference to use to understand searching is: <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html</a></p>",
