It has some ragged edges, and there are ongoing discussions about what really belongs in there, and what use cases it needs to support. These discussions are unlikely to be completed in the immediate future, but the ballot deadline is approaching. </p>\n<p>One option is to relax the datatype from code to CodeableConcept. This way, future discussions could refine the values (if necessary) without affecting the schema. </p>\n<p>Useful input:<br>\n1. do your systems support the property?<br>\n2. what are the values your system uses? (some already answered in gforge)<br>\n3. what are the use cases the values support? Is this a property that needs to support a state machine, and should be 'code', or is it more clinically open ended? <br>\n4. how much of a problem would a type change to CodeableConcept be?</p>\n<p>Trackers <a href=\"https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=14874&amp;start=0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=14874&amp;start=0\">14874</a> and <a href=\"https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13026\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13026\">13026</a>.</p>",
