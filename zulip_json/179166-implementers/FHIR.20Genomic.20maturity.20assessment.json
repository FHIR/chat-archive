The maturity on the use-cases definition and landscape is very high but I can't find reference implementation that are maintained and could be used to envision more robust deployment (the only one I see is on github here (<a href=\"https://github.com/ychen306/FHIR-Genomics\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ychen306/FHIR-Genomics\">https://github.com/ychen306/FHIR-Genomics</a>) but no change since 3 years.</p>\n<p>I'm wondering if any of you may confirm/un-confirm the above statement .... <br>\nAny complementary info that would help me assessing the maturity of the standard and the distance toward a mature offering is more than wellcome ...</p>\n<p>Regards</p>",
