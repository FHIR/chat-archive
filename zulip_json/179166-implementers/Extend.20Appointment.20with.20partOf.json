The proposistion is to use a \"main\" appointment that is communicated to patient through a patient portal, and then link a set of activities/ sub-appointments that is used to book the resources for the individual activities but not necessariliy communicated to the patient (and over time not be made available for change requests from the patient, as that will belong to the main appointment). Is it ok to extend Appointment with a partOF-attribute in the same way as  Encounter? Is this something that could be a candidate for a permanent being a permanent element for the Appointment resoruce?</p>",
