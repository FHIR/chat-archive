How valuable is it to be able to express that compared to making the code value manditory?</p>",

I've worked with a system where everything had to be coded, and practices were constantly asking for new values to be added even if the spec didn't provide it.  Unfortunately, the industry moves faster than the standards community.  Currently, we represent uncoded data as \"ADHoc\" and warn the user that the uncoded data will not interact with other data in a meaningful way.  If this were a perfect world, you would only allow coded data.  A small example edge case, but happens more frequently, is a doctor gets samples of a new drug and offers them to his patients but the drug database the doctor is using doesn't offer a code for that type of drug (Drug database data can be update weekly or monthly etc)</p>",
