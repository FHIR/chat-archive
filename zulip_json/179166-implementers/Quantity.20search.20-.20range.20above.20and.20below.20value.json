The examples in column 3 of the table don't seem to match the text in column 2, but based on the text I'm interpreting the definition of 'range below the value' to be any value less than the search parameter value, and the definition of 'range above the value' to be any value greater than or equal to the search parameter value. Is that correct?</p>",
