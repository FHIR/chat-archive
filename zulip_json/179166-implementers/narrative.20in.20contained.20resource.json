I try to upload a Patient to the Smile server with a <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/references.html#contained\">contained</a> resource Organization. This contained Organization resource includes narrative:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>...\n&quot;contained&quot;: [\n        {\n            &quot;id&quot;: &quot;Organization1&quot;,\n            &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;Organization&quot;,\n            &quot;text&quot;: {\n                &quot;status&quot;: &quot;generated&quot;,\n                &quot;div&quot;: &quot;&lt;div xmlns=\\&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\\&quot;&gt;Employer Description 1&lt;/div&gt;&quot;\n            },\n            &quot;type&quot;: [\n                {\n                    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;EMP_1&quot;\n                }\n            ],\n            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Employer Name 1&quot;\n        }\n    ]\n...\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>But when I post Patient resource with such Organization, the created record returned by the server does not include narrative:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>...\n&quot;contained&quot;: [\n    {\n        &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;Organization&quot;,\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;Organization1&quot;,\n        &quot;type&quot;: [\n            {\n                &quot;text&quot;: &quot;EMP_1&quot;\n            }\n        ],\n        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Employer Name 1&quot;\n    }\n]\n...\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>No error is returned from the Smile server when posting. Fetching resource results in the same outcome, contained resource is returned without the narrative. So my question is if there are any constraints on the narrative in contained resources (I could not find any)? Or it is a bug on the Smiler server side? Thank you for your help in advance!</p>",
