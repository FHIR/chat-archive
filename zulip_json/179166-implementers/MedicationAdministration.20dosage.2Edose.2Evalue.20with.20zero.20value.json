We authorize on the FHIR bundle generation, for a medication administration, a 0 value on the quantity. To make the smartphone app as open as possible, we'd think it is good to keep the possibility to give a medication, with a null or no quantity associated .. <br>\nAnd is it a good way of giving a quantity of 0 ? Or is there a better way to do this?</p>\n<p>Thanks for your feedback on this</p>\n<p>Regards<br>\nKrishna</p>",
