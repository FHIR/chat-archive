However we've become unsure as to what the minimum should include.<br>\nSay we declare a certain profile needs to be supported, this profile will be represented in the capabilityStatement. However, the profiles used for referenced profiles are not part of the capabilityStatement. <br>\nMy question is, how far should we go with the minimum requirements stated in our Capability Statements? Should we include these referenced profiles as well? <br>\nI am wondering if anyone has similar experience and use for the Capability Statements, who could offer advice what their course of action is.</p>",
