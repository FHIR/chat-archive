I just got my tester up without auth and cannot serve my custom bundle (This name is not known if FHIR version of \"DSTU3\"). Anyone worked around this?</p>\n<p>I am also curious to how you solve web tester auth towards different implementations? As of now I serve a read only bundle in one maven project whilest the web tester is being run seperately. I don't see how I am supposed to configure the client. Would be nice to hear some ideas on how to implement this.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\n// Thomas</p>",

If you want to interoperate, you're better off using Basic.  Custom resources really only work in closed communities and when you don't need to draw on any of the FHIR infrastructure.</p>",
