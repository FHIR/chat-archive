(15120-99, 15120-23, 15120-25, etc.). The relationship was 1:many on the logical model, but 1:1 on the physical. </p>\n<p>If the idea is that it's 1:many and that \"modifier\" is now more a relationship between one coded concept and another where they potentially cross terminologies (CPT term using a paired SNOMED CT term as a \"modifier\"), then it would seem that you'd treat coded concept has potentially having child coded concepts with some sort of relationship type indicator. </p>\n<p>This is really timely for me. We're revisiting this yet again internally and it's been really hard to have this conversation when bridging the clinical and billing mindsets. My personal experience has been that the clinical side sees a thing like a dx as being one instance with multiple coded terms, while the billing side seems to see a single dx as being exploded out to each line item. Within the latter there seem to be two schools within our team - each modifier is a separate line item vs. there's a related modifier array. It's interesting to see how the application of the data have shaped the perception of their structure and relationship.</p>\n<p>I'd love to really understand how people are approaching this.</p>",

I expect that likely it will be that one or more modifiers are appended to the CPT code separated by a '-' (hyphen).  This <a href=\"https://www.medicalbillingandcodingonline.com/cpt-modifiers/\">page</a> gives a brief description.  Usually there wouldn't be more than 2 modifiers (but the CMS 1500 and UB-04 forms do allow up to 4).  I also think it is important to note that the sequence of the modifiers may be and often will be <strong>significant</strong>, as it can affect reimbursement.  Using a \"post-coordinated expression\" with a defined syntax in the 'code' element easily supports representing and preserving the modifier sequence (whereas Claim.item.modifier used with Claim.item.productOrService <strong>does not</strong>).</p>",

        "content": "<p>With up to 4 modifiers, and the position of the modifiers being material, appending with the addition of -mod to the end of the codes leads an explosion of code combinations to be considered.  On the consumption side of things (measure logic against the procedure codes), we often need to be able to consider the codes with or without modifiers, depending on the measure requirements.  That requires stripping off the modifiers, etc.   Also makes binding and terminology checks, code validatation, etc more complex to handle all the permutations.</p>\n<p>In my opinion this is not a good implementation method.  Appending codes on the end with a -mod is a bit of a hack.  Was very surprised to see the modifiers not supported natively with their own CodeableConcept field.  Would prefer it be native to the procedure and other resources where CPT codes may be used, but we are planning to add an extension internally as needed to carry modifiers.</p>",
