How would someone construct an Observation FHIR resource that conveys that there is a result (i.e. the result is not null), but not specify the value, e.g. \"positive/negative\".  This could happen for data that is unstructured.</p>\n<p>One suggestion could be to leverage the \"boolean\" value type, and set it to \"Y\"; however, a concern would be mis-interpretation. Are there other suggestions?</p>\n<p>Thanks for anyone's thoughts.</p>",
