Normally we have at least 2 Groups defined for each ResearchStudy. This means that without a search parameter on ResearchStudy.Enrollment we have to send two additional requests to the FHIR server to be able to show the whole ResearchStudy in the frontend. </p>\n<p>With a search parameter we could use include queries and these additional two requests are not needed any more.</p>",

I am following up to find out what happened. I am interested in similar search parameters.  Is it recommended to only put patients research study cohorts in research subject and only use group for the criteria? What if you are using groups for non research related things. Is there an easy way to search what groups, studies, careteams, etc a patient belongs to.</p>",
