The hl7 standard <a href=\"http://url\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://url\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html</a> says that you can search something like this.</p>\n<p>`Note that chained parameters are applied independently to the target resource. For example,</p>\n<p>GET Patient?general-practitioner.name=Joe&amp;general-practitioner.address-state=MN`</p>\n<p>And I feel this is what may satisfy my usecase but wanted to confirm and also wanted to check what is corresponding HAPI API method(Java) that I need to use</p>",
