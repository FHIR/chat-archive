        "content": "<p>I'm looking at how decision data from artificial pancreas systems could be encoded using FHIR. Each one of the systems provides a different set of data regarding the decision that has been made, ranging from the device status at the point of the decision having been made (insulin reservoir status, battery status etc) to calculated insulin on board, the decision that was made (dose more / dose less / do nothing / alarm user) and data regarding the predictive mode estimates for how the blood glucose levels will behave in the near future. Looking at the R4 spec, this looks like a use case that's somewhat outside the scope of the current spec, where it could be argued the system is a <code>Device</code>, but possibly also a <code>Practitioner</code>? Another point of consideration is storing predictions, which is not covered by the current spec. Depending on system used, these status messages are produced 1-2 times / 5 minute interval (1 or 2 updates for each continuous glucose monitor data point), with future systems potentially producing 1 update / minute.</p>\n<p>The two use cases for storing the data would be both analysis of the decision data (so structured format is needed), but also potentially clinical use where a healthcare professional might want to access a visualization of the decision data along with separately stored blood glucose, insulin and carbohydrate consumption <code>Observation</code> and <code>MedicationAdministration</code> records. For the latter, it might be the easiest solution to store a textual description of the decision along with a generated image (so expert system visual generator is not needed at the moment of information display).</p>\n<p>Here's a sample output from one system, to give you an idea of the amount of information per update:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>{\n    &quot;device&quot;: &quot;&lt;redacted&gt;&quot;,\n    &quot;openaps&quot;: {\n        &quot;iob&quot;: {\n            &quot;iob&quot;: 0.88,\n            &quot;activity&quot;: 0.0042,\n            &quot;basaliob&quot;: -0.179,\n            &quot;bolusiob&quot;: 1.059,\n            &quot;netbasalinsulin&quot;: -0.05,\n            &quot;bolusinsulin&quot;: 1.2,\n            &quot;iobWithZeroTemp&quot;: {\n                &quot;iob&quot;: 0.93,\n                &quot;activity&quot;: 0.0043,\n                &quot;basaliob&quot;: -0.129,\n                &quot;bolusiob&quot;: 1.059,\n                &quot;netbasalinsulin&quot;: 0,\n                &quot;bolusinsulin&quot;: 1.2,\n                &quot;time&quot;: &quot;2019-06-14T07:24:41.000Z&quot;\n            },\n            &quot;lastBolusTime&quot;: 1560494766000,\n            &quot;lastTemp&quot;: {\n                &quot;rate&quot;: 0.8,\n                &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;2019-06-14T10:12:13+03:00&quot;,\n                &quot;started_at&quot;: &quot;2019-06-14T10:12:13+03:00&quot;,\n                &quot;date&quot;: 1560496333000,\n                &quot;duration&quot;: 13.54\n            },\n            &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;2019-06-14T07:24:41.000Z&quot;\n        },\n        &quot;suggested&quot;: {\n            &quot;temp&quot;: &quot;absolute&quot;,\n            &quot;bg&quot;: 142,\n            &quot;tick&quot;: &quot;+13&quot;,\n            &quot;eventualBG&quot;: 140,\n            &quot;insulinReq&quot;: 0.13,\n            &quot;reservoir&quot;: &quot;13.8&quot;,\n            &quot;deliverAt&quot;: &quot;2019-06-14T07:24:50.208Z&quot;,\n            &quot;sensitivityRatio&quot;: 1.04,\n            &quot;predBGs&quot;: {\n                &quot;IOB&quot;: [142, 154, 164, 172, 179, 184, 188, 190, 191, 191, 189, 186, 182, 177, 173, 169, 165, 161, 157, 153, 150, 146, 143, 140, 136, 134, 131, 128, 125, 123, 120, 118, 116, 114, 112, 110, 109, 107, 105, 104, 103, 101, 100, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95],\n                &quot;ZT&quot;: [142, 138, 135, 131, 126, 122, 118, 114, 110, 106, 103, 99, 96, 93, 90, 88, 86, 84, 83, 82, 81, 80, 80, 80, 81, 81, 82, 83, 85, 86, 88, 90, 93],\n                &quot;COB&quot;: [142, 154, 164, 173, 181, 187, 192, 196, 199, 200, 200, 199, 197, 194, 190, 186, 182, 178, 174, 170, 167, 163, 160, 157, 154, 151, 148, 145, 142, 140, 138, 135, 133, 131, 129, 127, 126, 124, 122, 121, 120, 118, 117, 116, 115, 114, 113, 112],\n                &quot;UAM&quot;: [142, 154, 165, 175, 183, 190, 197, 202, 207, 210, 213, 214, 215, 215, 214, 212, 209, 206, 202, 198, 195, 191, 188, 185, 181, 178, 176, 173, 170, 168, 165, 163, 161, 159, 157, 155, 154, 152, 150, 149, 147, 146, 145, 144, 143, 142, 141, 140]\n            },\n            &quot;COB&quot;: 12,\n            &quot;IOB&quot;: 0.88,\n            &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;COB: 12, Dev: 5.5, BGI: -0.2, ISF: 9.1, CR: 17, Target: 5.2, minPredBG 6.4, minGuardBG 6.8, IOBpredBG 5.3, COBpredBG 6.2, UAMpredBG 7.8;

(Responsibility tends to cascade up the chain to the organization that made the software or that manages the device.)  All of the point-in-time measurements (statuses, blood sugar levels, etc.) would be Observations.  The decisions taken could be represented in a few different ways.  Alerts would be Communications.  Adjustments to dosing would be MedicationAdministrations (if you're actually changing the dose) or MedicationRequest (if you're specifying a target dose that something else will then need to execute).  In terms of forecasting, that's a really interesting question.  My leaning would be to use Observation - where the code clearly indicates that you're doing a forecast.  The alternative would be a modifier extension on Observation that indicates the Observation is a forecast.  The effectiveTime would be the date at which the anticipated result would be expected.
