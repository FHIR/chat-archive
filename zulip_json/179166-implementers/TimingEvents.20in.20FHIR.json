In HL7 v3 it is possible to use TimingEvents (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/TimingEvent/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/TimingEvent/index.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/TimingEvent/index.html</a>) such as \"before breakfast\". I'm looking for a solution to timing, frequencies, and situations. Samples are:</p>\n<p>1. Medicine X three times a day 30 minutes before meal<br>\n2. Do &lt;examination&gt; after every urination<br>\n3. Medicine Y up to four times a day after defecation</p>\n<p>The timing and frequencies I have solved, but are there any codes for common situations for when to do things, or should a free text fiend be used (MedicationOrder.dosageInstruction.text)?</p>\n<p>In advance, thank you!</p>",
