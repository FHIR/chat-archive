I was reviewing the FHIR 4.0.1 standard online and it appears to indicate the languages value set (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-languages.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-languages.html</a>) uses a subset of the ISO 639-1 data set rather than the entire set.  Is this correct or am I missing something?  Thank you.</p>",

Mostly there'll be an extensible/example binding of this value set, so you could use whatever codes [languages] you want. Remember that sometimes FHIR can't reference/use a particular terminology because of licensing restrictions - one may very well need a license to use ISO 639-1, whilst the codes in the RFC mentioned in the value set definition can be used for free.</p>",
