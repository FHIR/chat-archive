(e.g. code, id, extension, value).  We can look those up via the Observation SD, but if the snapshot should have all the info to build the component this seems like a bug.  Similar profiles like bodyheight (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/bodyheight.profile.json.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/bodyheight.profile.json.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/bodyheight.profile.json.html</a>) DO list the leaf nodes on Observation.component as I would have expected.  </p>\n<p>Does that sound correct?  If so, I'm planning on submitting a handful of tasks related to profiles today, I can include that one</p>",
