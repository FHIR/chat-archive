Meaning the search parameter has already set the type of subject to Patient, so no need to do the [type]/[id] ---- the example for this on <a href=\"http://hl7-fhir.github.io/search.html#reference\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7-fhir.github.io/search.html#reference\">http://hl7-fhir.github.io/search.html#reference</a> is telling us different. But this example is not showing the use of the 'patient' search parameter, always using 'subject'.</p>",
