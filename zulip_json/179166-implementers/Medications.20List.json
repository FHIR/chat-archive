We have alot of data we want to store about the reconciled list that may be quite fluid and there is no neat place for data to reside so we were thinking of extending the list to reference a QuestionnaireResponse resource and define the data we want to store using a Questionnaire definition. The UI could also leverage the SMartQ framework. What are peoples thoughts on this approach? And how would I create an extension to a List resource that references a QuestionnaireResponse?</p>",

The List resource references other resources. Lists may be curated and have specific business meaning.<br>\nThe Composition resource - defines a set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a single logical document that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to who is making the statement. The Composition resource provides the basic structure of a FHIR document. The full content of the document is expressed using a bundle containing the Composition and its entries.</p>",
