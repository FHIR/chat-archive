Is there any need to convey the text the user actually saw on the screen.</p>\n<p>In general, you also want to think about whether the \"required\" binding should be in the extension definition - everyone who uses this extension must use this value set; or whether to leave the extension definition loose and tighten it up in the profile.  The latter approach will allow other implementation environments to use the same extension with different codes when the semantic is the same - and you'll get a bit more interoperability through translations or at least having \"text\" present</p>",
