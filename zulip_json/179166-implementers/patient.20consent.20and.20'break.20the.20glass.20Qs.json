As Rene points out, there are some mentions of Break-Glass around Consent resource and on the Security pages. These are discussion around the intersection of the concept. We expect that some Consents will need to record that the patient has allowed or disallowed break-glass. We expect that a RESTful API might need a way to convey that the user has invoked their authorized break-glass privilage.</p>",

This has been, where I've seen it implemented, a jurisdictional / HIE permitted  option... not a patient permitted option. The pattern I'm most familiar with is that a provider queries... is returned some or no data, but it is indicated that <strong>data was omitted</strong> due to a consent directive... and if it is supported, the provider then invokes a BTG query which returns everything but which lays down a mandatory audit record including the provider's \"override\" justification.</p>",
