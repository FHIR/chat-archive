But some of the fields we have are not in the default Patient structure. For example, there is this birthSex fields we have that's supposed be an extension, but I couldn't find the correct way to implement it. I took a look at the FHIRPatient.php in FHIRDomainResource but it doesn't have anything related to extensions. I would really appreciate your help if you could give me some instructions or show me some examples. Also, do I need to include any other packages other besides <code>FHIRPatient</code> since it doesn't provide anything to do with extension? The Patient structure I'm referring to is <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/2019Sep/StructureDefinition-obf-Patient-definitions.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/2019Sep/StructureDefinition-obf-Patient-definitions.html</a></p>",

I found <a href=\"https://github.com/dcarbone/php-fhir-generated\">https://github.com/dcarbone/php-fhir-generated</a> but looks like this is for parsing the input. I'm trying to write in php a generator that will create patient and other resources from our DB. Any suggestions on how to go about this, or any FHIR framework available for generating where I can plugin my DB and SELECT statements? Thanks for any suggestions towards this.</p>",
