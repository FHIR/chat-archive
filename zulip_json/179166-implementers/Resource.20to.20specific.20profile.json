You don;t need to do anything extra.<br>\nA system can check instances of, say Patient, to see whether they conform to a specific profile, say MyPatient and respond accordingly, say by accepting or rejecting a CRUD Post.<br>\nAn instance can assert which profiles it conforms to using meta.profile. But that assertion is just an assertion. An instance can be tested against and conform to a profile without claiming conformance to it.<br>\nOne way to test whether your instance does conform to your profile is to use the <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Using+the+FHIR+Validator\" title=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Using+the+FHIR+Validator\">FHIR validator</a>, other options are described here <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Public+FHIR+Validation+Services\" title=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Public+FHIR+Validation+Services\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Public+FHIR+Validation+Services</a></p>",
