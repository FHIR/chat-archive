The official Nuget Packages  Hl7.Fhir.STU3  and Hl7.Fhir.R4 cannot used within the same project due to namespace collisions. There is package Carevolution.Fhir.Core (<a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/CareEvolution.Fhir.Core/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/CareEvolution.Fhir.Core/\">https://www.nuget.org/packages/CareEvolution.Fhir.Core/</a>) supports multiple versions within the same assembly. It is less frequently updated and not sure what is supported in CareEvolution vs. the Official packages. It states it supports POCO &amp; serializations. Any help is much appreciated.</p>",
