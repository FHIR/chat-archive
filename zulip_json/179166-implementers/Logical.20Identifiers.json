So all participants will generally be able to resolve those identifiers (if not they they know how to resolve them) and so can produce full resources. It seems like an overkill to use messaging and we communiction could be done RESTful using logical identifiers. [Some of the 'logical references' will become proper references but would still be handled as logical. i.e. If I have a resource with NationalID X, I'd like to refer to it with a logical reference because the receiving system will also have a resource with NationalID X, if it doesn't, it knows how to resolve it]</p>",
