I think we'll likely need to broaden the Vital Signs profile to also allow valueRange.  It's interesting, though, the way this is being charted.  The raw measurement of RR is a number, as represented by the dots, but in this case the actual value isn't being preserved and only the range is available.   I haven't really considered this before, but I'm not sure if we have a good way of dealing with the precision of data - e.g. recording a point value along with a confidence interval (what we have here is similar, except that the point value itself isn't being recorded).
