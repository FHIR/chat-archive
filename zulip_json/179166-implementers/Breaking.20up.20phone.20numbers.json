This request was initiated based on a query from a tutorial rather than implementer request.  Before evaluating it, we'd like to know if implementers are already doing this or if they'd be likely to use the extensions if they were defined.</p>",

In some of our projects, we work with legacy systems, which have fields in their databases for different parts of the number: country code, area code, etc. It's not a problem to concatenate these fields outbound, but it's a pain to parse FHIR phone numbers when we have to feed data to these systems or if we need to support search by phone numbers.</p>",
