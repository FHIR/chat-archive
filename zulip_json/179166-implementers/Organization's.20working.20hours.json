To set the working hours of the department I need to use a distinct PractitionerRole (fake role)... Could you answer why an organization resource doesn't have it in a core element list? Please clarify the reason or correct me in my understanding of the use case. Is it an unreal case to provide working hours for a department (as a logical structure item of medical practice)?</p>",
