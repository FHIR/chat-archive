We need to bind these sums to a patient or their episode of care somehow. </p>\n<p>Our Care Management System is neither the provider of these services, nor the insurer. It's a third party aimed to save money for a patient and insurer by avoiding expensive ER visits or using an alternative medication. I've looked at the Claim resource. I thought it might work for us if there was an ability to mark such a claim as never happened as this service was not provided to a patient (e.g. the service was possible to be necessary but the patient managed to avoid it).</p>\n<p>Example of data:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/9unryl8ck7oMchmpKabvKOrz/scr-2018-04-06_00-50-29.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"scr-2018-04-06_00-50-29.png\">scr-2018-04-06_00-50-29.png</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/S5qjICHEqM7phcqBcGcqSFzw/scr-2018-04-06_00-53-16.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"scr-2018-04-06_00-53-16.png\">scr-2018-04-06_00-53-16.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/9unryl8ck7oMchmpKabvKOrz/scr-2018-04-06_00-50-29.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"scr-2018-04-06_00-50-29.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/9unryl8ck7oMchmpKabvKOrz/scr-2018-04-06_00-50-29.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/S5qjICHEqM7phcqBcGcqSFzw/scr-2018-04-06_00-53-16.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"scr-2018-04-06_00-53-16.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/S5qjICHEqM7phcqBcGcqSFzw/scr-2018-04-06_00-53-16.png\"></a></div>",
