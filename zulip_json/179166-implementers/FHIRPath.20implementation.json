If yes what would be the procedure?<br>\nFeel free to give me your kind of suggestions.<br>\nThanks, in advance.</p>",

A lot of environments can't touch GPL code because of viral licensing concerns.  </p>\n<p>In answer to your question, if you want to include the word 'fhir' in any part of a product name (including fhirpath), then you need to request permission.  This is talked about on the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/license.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/license.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/license.html</a> page.
