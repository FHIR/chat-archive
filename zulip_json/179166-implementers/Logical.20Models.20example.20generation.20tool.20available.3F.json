I could find some of the definitions in Mr. David Hay's blog but does not contain json/xml samples to upload. finally I reached the following site <a href=\"http://fhir.hl7.org.au/fhir/rcpa/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhir.hl7.org.au/fhir/rcpa/index.html\">http://fhir.hl7.org.au/fhir/rcpa/index.html</a> where I could find some samples for prostate and cancer reporting. Cancer reporting is also something which I am interested in. But I could not find any mechanism to upload the logical model and the respective message in HAPI server. Can someone help me out in this</p>",

However, you can use your logical model to define your internal structure and then use StructureMap to translate that to the corresponding resource or resource bundle which you could then send to a test server.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I'm taking a slightly different approach wrt generating the 'real' profile from the Logical Model. If the model covers a single base Type (like Condition for example) then you can 'map' the elements in the model (including extensions) and then generate the profile directly form the model (providing that it's not too complex). I suspect that that process could generate the StructureMap to 'document' the transform.</p>\n<p>If the model covers more than one base type, then it becomes a bit trickier - haven't figured out the best way to do this yet.</p>\n<p>But regardless of how automated you can make the transform - or if it simple acts as 'requirements' for a FHIR expert to generate the artifacts using a tool like Forge - I be;ieve the Logical Model is a great way to interact with Clinicians &amp; BA's...</p>",
