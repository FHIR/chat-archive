I have a Patient Profile and I want to use '<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-race\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-race</a>' in my profile. Should I add a dependency in the sushi-config file , I have gone through the tutorial and am able to define a custom extension but how do I re-use an extension that is being defined in another Implementation?<br>\nIf I have to add a dependency, please provide the package and version as I tried few packages and the tool was not able to download</p>",
