Because the data types are FMM level 5, we are soliciting implementer feedback on the change.  The details are here: <a href=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13265\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13265\">GF#13265</a>.  The gist of the proposed change is to add an \"old\" use code for Identifier, similar to the codes we have on HumanName, Address and ContactPoint for use with identifiers that are no longer 'valid' for the resource on which they appear, but may still be useful for search purposes.  Please identify any concerns you see with making this substantive (but backward compatible) change.</p>",
