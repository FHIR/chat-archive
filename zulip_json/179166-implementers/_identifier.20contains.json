So I used the query as follows: [base]/MedicationKnowledge?_identifier = 12345XX9876542-2020 and to my surprise it fetched all the MedicationKnowledge resources where identifier.value contains '12345XX9876542-2020'. Is this a valid query or some erroneous query? My understanding was that we cannot perform a 'contains' in token datatypes. I performed this in HAPI. Your feedback would be highly appreciated. Thank you !</p>",
