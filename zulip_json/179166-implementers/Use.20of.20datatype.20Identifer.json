The system doesn't indicate where to go find the information, it's just a URI for the namespace and ensures the identifier is globally unique.  It's nice if the system URI resolves to a webpage that describes what the identifier is or even allows you to look up records based on that identifier, but that's absolutely not required.</p>",
