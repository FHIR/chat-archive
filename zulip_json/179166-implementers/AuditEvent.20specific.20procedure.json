Typically the AuditEvent.entity can carry more specific codes like the SNOMED code for \"Chest CT\".  This said, I would recommend against overly duplicating clinical or personal information in the AuditEvent. The AuditEvent should leverage references and identifiers to the resource/object that was created or updated. The AuditEvent is not intended to duplicate that information.</p>",
