Problem space: FHIR offers a way package profiles and other conformance resources and have packages depend on other packages. This could solve a number of versioning issues.</p>\n<p>Packages are not(?) described as part of R4 and tooling support is just starting up. Implementations will need to work with a mix of packaged and non-packaged 'stuff' for some time to come. What's the recommendation for modelers and/or implementers to deal with that?</p>\n<p>Are there any fallback scenarios? Support for the pipe syntax for pointing from profile version to profile version is not supported very broadly either.</p>\n<p>A day/time has not been set yet, but leaning towards Thursday afternoon.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191450\">@Simone Heckmann</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191336\">@Michel Rutten</span></p>",
