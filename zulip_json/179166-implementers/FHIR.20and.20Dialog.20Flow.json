Find out for yourself how to do REST calls from DialogFlow, and what data you would like to retrieve. If you then have more specific questions on the format of the REST call or the resources to retrieve, you are most welcome to post them here.<br>\nTo make FHIR REST calls there are several libraries (C#, Java, JS), depending on your dev language. Each has its own stream here.</p>",
