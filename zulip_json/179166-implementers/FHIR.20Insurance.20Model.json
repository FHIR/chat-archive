For example, Claim is for some surgery which involves multiple small procedures. Provider sent a Claim with one service instance mentioning surgery. Insurer in response can provide adjudication of this surgery service under ClaimResponse.item, and, if they break down surgery to multiple small procedures and want to respond how much they are paying for each small part of that surgery then they can use ClaimResponse.addItem?
