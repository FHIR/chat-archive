Could you kindly advise or point me to any useful links that would help me understand how to convert FHIR profiles to NUGET or C# classes.  Ideally, if there is a tool that could do this, that would be great.  If that tool is free, even better. <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span></p>",
