But then how to distinguish them?</p>",

By default we even fill in the code meaning (i.e. same as FHIR coding.display). So without the user doing anything that's a perfect fit. But I have no idea how far the users edit that field, and since they can, we have to assume they do put anything they don't find another field for. But then again in most cases it will pass as \"refinement\" of what the code expresses. I'll try to collect some clinical examples...</p>",
