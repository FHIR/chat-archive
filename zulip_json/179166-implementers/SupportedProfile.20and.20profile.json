I have 4 profiles, which extend and restrict the Communication resource differently. The CapabilityStatement holds the 4 mentioned profiles in the supportedProfiles field for resource of type Communication. But I am wondering about the profile field (which would be the superset of all 4 profiles).<br>\nShould there be a 5th profile (the superset) defined or can it be left empty, when a resource will fit only one profile at a time (so no superset resource is ever created)?</p>",
