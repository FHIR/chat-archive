A patient can have Medicare as a coverage. That usually means they have Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B. In an acute setting, Part A is the primary coverage. In an ambulatory setting, Part B is the primary. Rather than the consumer constantly changing the priority of the patient coverages, you could have a multiple lists of Coverage. So List.code would be \"coverage\", and my proposal for List.type would further codify the list to \"inpatient\" and \"outpatient\". That way the list has Medicare Part A and B prioritized correctly for the venue of care where the coverage is being utilized.</p>",
