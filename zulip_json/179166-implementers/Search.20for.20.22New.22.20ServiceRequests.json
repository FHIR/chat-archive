I presume that broadly this means that the creation date could be different than the signed date?</p>\n<p>I <em>think</em> i could use AuthoredOn if i say that the authoredOn date can't be BEFORE the date/time that it was submitted to the eReferral server. Is this ok as an approach? Am i missing another approach for finding new resources?</p>",

(Things can be posted as a FYI, not just because they want you to do them.)  If you use Task, then you can filter on the status of the Task.  If you just use a tag, then authoredOn is your best bet.  It's really about when the Request was transitioned to Active - presumably you don't care about draft requests that aren't yet complete/authorized.</p>",
