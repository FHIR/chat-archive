This is a follow-up question regarding the use of ExplanationOfBenefit.payment.identifier for the check number.  We have recently discovered there can be multiple check numbers for a given claim that need to be stored.  The ExplanationOfBenefit.payment has a cardinality of 0..1 and doesn't allow for multiple check numbers.  Is this something I would need to request via gForge to get the cardinality changed to 0..*?</p>",
