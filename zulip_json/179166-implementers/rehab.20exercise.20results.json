The patient needs to performs rehab exercises for their knee, and we want to capture individual exercise rep results (e.g. flexion and extension angle). A typical \"observation\" should include:<br>\nexercise type<br>\nnumber of sets/repetitions in set<br>\nflexion/extension angles for each single repetition.<br>\nWe could model a single exercise as an observation. <br>\nThe flexion/extension angles series could be valueSampleData components, although semantically it's incorrect, but I cannot find other suitable ways.<br>\nAlso not sure how to model the individual sets, or to track them as metrics. <br>\nAny feedback from the experts?</p>",

A few days in the ICU could easily result in 10k+ Observations from the various continuous vitals monitors.  If you wanted to look at the progress of extension angle over several weeks, you should be able to retrieve that without necessarily grabbing anything else.  Typically we only use Observation.component for stuff that is almost always looked at and evaluated together (systolic/diastolic; parts of an APGAR) or pieces that don't have any meaning when looked at independently (e.g. susceptibility and antibiotic).</p>",
