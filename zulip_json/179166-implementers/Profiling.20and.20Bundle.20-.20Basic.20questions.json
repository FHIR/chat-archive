But still I'm quite confused about some really basic things. So maybe you can help me.</p>\n<p>In my scenario I have some data and need to create an export based on HL7 FHIR. As far as I have understood everything correctly, it is first necessary to search for existing profiles and extensions on which I can map my data. The first version of my export will only contain very basic information, so I can map everything to the resources Patient, Observation and Questionnaire/questionnaireResponse and collect them in a (collection) bundle.</p>\n<p>My questions would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It would be possible to map all my patient-related data on the patient profile. However, I would only use some elements of the profile, e.g. I would not provide a photo or contact. In this case, would it be best practice to create your own profile based on the patient profile and to restrict it, or would it be better to use only the patient profile \"as it is\" without using every element?</li>\n<li>If I want to export data in a bundle, can I just create a bundle and export it or is it necessary to first create some kind of definition what data will be included in my bundle?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would appreciate any help. Thanks</p>",

QuestionnaireResponse can be used to convey any kind of information imaginable, but it doesn't do so in a 'standard' way - so if you're exporting medications, allergies, labs, etc. using QuestionnaireResponse, you won't find systems who know how to import data that way - at least not such that it will show up in the appropriate part of their system.  If you just want the data to show up as \"questionnaire responses\" and not as allergy lists, problem lists, lab results, etc. then using Q/QR is fine.</p>",

So in general, if I would only set restrictions for one profile, should I rather not use profiling?</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> Thanks for your remarks. I understand the problems with questionnaires. At the moment there is no actual system which will perform any import. It's a general requirement to perform an export based on FHIR and to describe my own export 'specifictaion', so others could use this export later. The data that I have are predefined questions and the given answers to these questions regarding special circumstances of a disease and other not related things. So for me it seems that Q/QR may be the best way to export the data. What do you think?</p>\n<p>Is there a standard way to describe an export that is performed with different FHIR profiles in a bundle?</p>",
