(I'm a vet so all we ever look at is systolic -  :-) ). I'm speculating that it is an extension becasue the PC workgroup did not  know if it would be commonly support instead of a text blob in Goal.description.   Lloyd will probably chime in here soon....</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191401\">@Eric Haas</span> is correct.  We weren't confident that most systems that handle goals are capable of capturing discrete target values.  (We weren't confident they weren't either, so this is one of those \"define an extension and see what implementers do\" scenarios.)  You'd need to declare multiple goal-target extensions on your goal - one for systolic and one for diastolic - both with a value as a Quantity.</p>",
