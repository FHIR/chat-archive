Observation isn't allowed to point to a RelatedPerson. Should we create extensions for RelatedPerson or should the parents themselves also be Patient resources (even if they may not actually be a patient)?<br>\n2) If the parent is represented using RelatedPerson but they are deceased (we still want to capture information on them), does that violate the spirit of RelatedPerson as someone \"that is involved in the care for a patient\"?</p>",

Reason for this is that otherwise there is a room for ambiguity with how to use focus (is it needed? if used, could it be the grandmother/fathers height) as well as scalability issues with precoordinating such concepts. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Additional discussions/thoughts</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why is there an explicit FamilyMemberHistory to use for certain family member information? Why not just use Condition with a focus element (or use the focus pattern on any more \"fundamental\" resource to which there could be another focus than the subject, feels like it scales better)? </li>\n<li>Even if we stick with FamilyMemberHistory, why not use the same naming conventions as in Observation to make this use case easier for implementers. Ie, use FamilyMemberHistory.focus as opposed to FamilyMemberHistory.???</li>\n<li>There also seems to be some overlap between FamilyMemberHistory and RelatedPerson, why not reference a related person in the FamilyMemberHistory instead of explicitly specifiying several elements that exist on RelatedPerson?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a common use case in healthcare, and it is difficult for implementers to know how to support these use cases.
