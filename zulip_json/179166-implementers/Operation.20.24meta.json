However, the list \"will not contain versionId, lastUpdated etc.\". Furthermore, it is not clear to me if the profiles, tags and security labels that are returned in the list will be organized by the resource to which they belong.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know how to implement the $meta operation in such a way that returns ALL of the meta elements, and arranges them by the resource they belong to?</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time.</p>",
