I am looking for a tool that can import IG files, create sample instances based on user inputted values and finally organize them in a JSON bundle.  <br>\nI have tried the 'Scenario builder' in Clinfhir where you can create individual resources that can be combined to a bundle , is there any other tool out there with similar functionalities?<br>\nThanks!</p>",
