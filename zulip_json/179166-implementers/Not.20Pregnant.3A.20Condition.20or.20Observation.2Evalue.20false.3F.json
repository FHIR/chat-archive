I'm just saying that the use of that isn't intended to cover Alexander's scenario.  It's more for situations when you have a number of candidate diagnoses and you've ruled out some of them or there was a belief at one point that a patient had a given condition and you've subsequently confirmed that they don't (and never did) - presumably because they had something else instead.</p>",
