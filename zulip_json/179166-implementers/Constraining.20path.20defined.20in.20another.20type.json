For example, <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/stu1/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.json.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/stu1/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.json.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/stu1/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.json.html</a> profile places restriction on \"Patient.name.family\" which is defined for \"HumanName.family\".</p>\n<p>So, I assume the answer is \"yes\", it is allowed, but want to make sure.</p>",
