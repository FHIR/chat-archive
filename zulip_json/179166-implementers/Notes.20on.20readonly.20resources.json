But they could add some notes on the data. Currently our systems (non-FHIR) use a separate resource to capture the notes and link it with source data.</p>\n<p>Almost every resource in FHIR does have a note(s) property (of type Annotation) which handles the situation if readonly restriction was not in place. What could be a possible way to achieve it?<br>\nOne of the first thoughts was to create a duplicate of the resource, add the extra note and link with original resource (maybe using linkage resource). But this needs the clients to understand that duplicates exist and find the best resource based on some logic.<br>\nAny other thoughts or comments on current thought?</p>",
