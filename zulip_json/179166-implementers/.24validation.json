It's been a great tool for us, but we wanted to provide a few issues and comments about how to improve the output of the validation OperationOutcomes that are sent on the response. I'm wondering, is that content based off of the HL7 spec itself, or are the validation errors custom to the HAPI implementation? Basically, let me know if you want to here feedback, and I can either send it your way, create a gForge (if appropriate), or both. Thanks!</p>",

        "content": "<p>it's a bit of both. Probably many of the errors come right out of the spec validator. I suggest you raise the specific issues on the hapi stream (here in Zulip) and then we can raise gForge issues for the spec or github issues for Hapi once we have clarity on the issues </p>",
