I couldn’t find any forum/chatroom rules, so I’ll tentatively ask a few questions and hope for some friendly guidance.</p>\n<p>I am the developer of an exercise prescription App (Web and Mobile) and would like to take steps towards making our service HL7 and FHIR compliant/compatible. We are seeking integration at a high level instead of chasing around looking to connect with each individual EHR which has proved to be rather difficult unless they have a modern API (Cliniko, DrChrono).</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we would like to position ourselves as ‘ready’ to make connections quickly and easily to healthcare systems around the world (think of approaching the NHS and actually being ready to offer a service). </p>\n<p>My questions are mainly focussed around where I should take my first steps. </p>\n<p>Just starting to look into this where should I go? I see there are services such as <a href=\"https://smarthealthit.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://smarthealthit.org\">https://smarthealthit.org</a> and a number of others that promise connectivity via FHIR. If we can simply use a library such as smarthealthkit then it all looks simple. In fact, too simple!? <br>\nIn order to be seen as a credible service is there a HL7/FHIR accreditation / certification? I note that the certification (<a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/implement/certification.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hl7.org/implement/certification.cfm\">http://www.hl7.org/implement/certification.cfm</a>) seems to be more related to ‘people’ rather than ‘services / apps’. <br>\nConsultants: Where can I find a directory of people than could offer consultancy services on levelling up? </p>\n<p>By the look of all the questions / streams this is probably the wrong place to ask, however I would rather ask blindly start some courses <a href=\"https://www.pathlms.com/hl7/categories/423/courses\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.pathlms.com/hl7/categories/423/courses\">https://www.pathlms.com/hl7/categories/423/courses</a>. </p>\n<p>Many thanks in advance. </p>",

        "content": "<p>The forum/chatroom rules are (here)[http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Chat.fhir.org_community_expectations].  (You should have seen a link when you signed up?)  In any case, these questions are well within the bounds.<br>\nWe do try to make the libraries simple and easy to use.  However, there's always complexity hidden somewhere - whether it's getting people to agree on what to share, how to manage to consent, what code systems to use or how to translate, etc. :)<br>\nThere is no FHIR accreditation/certification yet.  The standard is not yet fully locked down, so certification is a bit premature.  That said, there are certainly testing services available.  We'll be exploring the notion of certification as parts of the standard become normative (which we believe will start towards the end of 2018)<br>\nWe don't have a directory of consultants - in part because we're still finalizing the certification process for the people that would allow us to have some degree of confidence that the people on the list could deliver appropriate expertise.  Hopefully that'll be in place for the end of this year.<br>\nThere's a lot of free training materials, blogs and other content available with a simple search.  HL7 does offer some good materials (though I'm biased because I teach some of it).  Probably the best way to \"level up\" is to come to a connectathon &amp; WGM.  That will surround you with other developers, easy access to the experts, real hands-on experience and a chance to interoperate with (and chat with) other developers.  Plus it will give you access to a bunch of tutorials and to the working group sessions where the specification actually evolves so you can get a sense of who the people are and where the standard is at.</p>",

I see that there is a session at Salford in two days time, I am going to try and get across to that. <br>\nCould you ping me a link to some of your lesson content and direct me to some sandboxing services? <br>\nThanks again</p>",

        "content": "<p>I wouldn't label FHIR as \"immature\".  Much of it is pretty robust and is implemented in production in hundreds, if not thousands of locations.  Each resource (and most pages) in the spec have a number indicating their maturity level on a 5-point scale.  The core spec and some of the core resources are likely to get locked down in the next release.<br>\nYou can find a bunch of the training slides in HL7's source control <a href=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/scmsvn/?action=browse&amp;path=%2Ftrunk%2Fpresentations%2F\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/scmsvn/?action=browse&amp;path=%2Ftrunk%2Fpresentations%2F\">here</a>.  If you want the voice walking through them, you'll have to pay for the webinars though.  Furore has a ton of <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user12740828/videos\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://vimeo.com/user12740828/videos\">videos</a> at both the technical and executive level - many from their FHIR Developer Days conference.<br>\nThere's actually a link to FHIR test servers directly off the FHIR home page.  Scroll down to the bottom and look for \"FHIR Public Test Servers\" which will take you to the appropriate wiki page.  There's a bunch of other material on the FHIR wiki page as well.</p>",

I didn't think that this was going to be so easy, I must be missing something, hence a few more questions: </p>\n<p>What I did:<br>\nI got the testing URL <code>http://vonk.furore.com</code> and using postman I was able to perform REST requests such as <code>http://vonk.furore.com/Patient?family=ChalmersNDsluF</code> which returned data as expected - great! </p>\n<p>What I expect I can do now:<br>\nI will be able to perform all the patient search and CRUD via REST, in addition to adding patient notes - in my case a list of exercises that forms an exercise prescription programme. I plan on doing this via AngularJS <code>$http</code> from the client side, for which I anticipate using <a href=\"http://docs.smarthealthit.org/tutorials/javascript/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://docs.smarthealthit.org/tutorials/javascript/\">SMART</a>. </p>\n<p>My one last question:<br>\nSome of the largest healthcare organisations in the world are looking to use FHIR, and I could integrate this into my App within an afternoon's work. Aside from the authorization side of things (which I anticipate following this <a href=\"http://docs.smarthealthit.org/authorization/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://docs.smarthealthit.org/authorization/\">guide</a> for), what am I missing... or can I just crack on and make this a feature and advertise the fact that we are FHIR compatible and ready? </p>",
