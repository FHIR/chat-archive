I've got some NPI fields which I don't know were to put. These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provider Identifier State </li>\n<li>Provider Identifier Type Code </li>\n<li>Provider Identifier Issuer</li>\n<li>License Number State Code</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently, I'm choosing between adding an extension to an Identifier entity or just using CodableConept for that. The examples are:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span> :identifier\n [{:value &quot;1553&quot;,\n   :extension\n   {:url &quot;https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/&quot;,\n    :extension\n    [{:url &quot;other_provider_identifier_state&quot;, :valueString &quot;NE&quot;}\n     {:url &quot;other_provider_identifier_type_code&quot;, :valueString &quot;OTHER&quot;}\n     {:url &quot;other_provider_identifier_issuer&quot;, :valueString &quot;BCBS&quot;}]}}\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>VS</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span> :identifier\n [{:value &quot;1553&quot;,\n   :type\n   {:coding\n    [{:system &quot;other_provider_identifier_state&quot;, :code &quot;NE&quot;}\n     {:system &quot;other_provider_identifier_type_code&quot;, :code &quot;OTHER&quot;}\n     {:system &quot;other_provider_identifier_issuer&quot;, :code &quot;BCBS&quot;}]}}\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>My question is, which variant would be better to prefer?
