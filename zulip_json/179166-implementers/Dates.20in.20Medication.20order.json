Can anyone shed some light on why the medication order (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/medicationorder.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/medicationorder.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/medicationorder.html</a>) has a dateEnded (which is clearly about the medication as indicated by reasonEnded), but does not have a dateStarted?<br>\nWe have HL7 V2 data that includes the start and end date times, and we are not able to map the start date while the end date can be mapped.

I'm not familiar with many/any systems that capture the former, though it could certainly be done with an extension.
