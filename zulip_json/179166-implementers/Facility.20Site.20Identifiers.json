        "content": "<p>Recently, I was presented with an interesting assertion: There is no healthcare facility identifier that uniquely identifies a given facility location in the United States. Indeed, I am hard pressed to disagree. </p>\n<p>Organizationa are allowed to have more than one Organization NPI numbers in NPPES. Recent changes to NPPES allow for a single Organizational NPI to support multiple addresses. Practically there are many different clinics and hospitals that have multiple different sites that use the same NPI for billing and see no reason to change this, instead using billing address to differentiate to payers their various sites of service. </p>\n<p>Neither is Medicare CCN an appropriate 1-to-1 facility to facility address match. CCN represent the \"contract number with CMS\" and is frequently used between sites with very different locations. </p>\n<p>I see that HL7 has an OID service here:  <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/OID\">www.hl7.org/OID</a> which seems to allow FHIR/NPPES/whatever to be subsumed underneath it, but it does appear to also be issuing unique OIDs to identify specific hospitals facilities too, but I see no indication that this even attempt to uniquely identify facilities by location. </p>\n<p>I understand that FHIR URLs might be used in practitioner/facility identifiers data fields in what might previously have been only the domain of OID identifiers in the future (am I right? I have no idea).  What is the closest thing we have to a unique identifier today? </p>\n<p>If none exists, what is the most expedient way to make one that is compatible generally with FHIR including the provider directory efforts?</p>\n<p>You were all so helpful the last time I asked about credentialling data, which is, like this question, adjacent to alot of the interoperability standards, I had hoped that someone might know more and be able to help my obviously amatuerish understanding of this issue. </p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\n-Fred Trotter</p>",

Plan-Net is not going to define or create a unique identifier for a location. Health Plans in most instances do not recognize (enroll, contract, credential) the location, i.e. the address, absent any information about the provider and therefore the location does not stand alone. Providers may enumerate within their systems their locations but such enumeration would not normally be information they need to share outside their own internal systems.</p>",
