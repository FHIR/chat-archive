If my question is not directed to the right stream, please let me know and I will resend it to the correct stream! </p>\n<p>Anyways I have a question around the use cases of FIHR. I am confused about when and how FIHR would be used. Assume I built an EHR system that was currently in operation in a clinic. Now assume It's been active for years and so I have years of data stored in whatever format I decided. At what point would I interact with a FIHR server? Is it only when there is a need to communicate this data out to another system?</p>",

However, if you've got an EHR system, it's pretty much a given that there'll be a need for exchange - your patients are going to want their data to be accessible elsewhere, and you'll likely want to be able to consume information that gets originally captured outside your EHR.  You might also have an interest in supporting SMART on FHIR or CDS Hooks which allow your EHR to be extended by 3rd party apps - and which depend on having a FHIR server.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks for the quick reply Lloyd! That makes sense. So if I am to understand this correctly, that means when the time comes for there to be a need for the data to be accessible elsewhere, I would:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert my data to fit the FIHR format</li>\n<li>Allow other clinics/organizations to access my server that contains my data in FIHR format (Done through some API's)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And because it is in a mutually understandable format, they will be able to process and make sense of the data, assuming they are also in line with FIHR. Is this correct?</p>",
