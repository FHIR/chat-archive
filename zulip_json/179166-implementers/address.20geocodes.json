The values of these will remain fixed. GDA94 position values, therefore, are NOT affected by continental drift. The RELATIONSHIP of positions to each other, such as between 2 seismic shots, or of an object relative to the Trigonometric beacon used to locate that object, will NOT change.</p>\n<p>However, ABSOLUTE positions in Australia, measured in a world-wide system, will change over the long term. WGS84 is such a world-wide system. This is one of the reasons why the exact relationship between GDA94 and WGS84 coordinates for points is not constant.</p>\n<p>In the future, GPS systems which measure absolute positions to centimetre precision, may become commonly available. This will necessitate new rules for dealing with the gradual change of absolute positions.\"</p>",
