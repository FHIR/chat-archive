In order to force saving to JSON, manually rename the file extension in the Save dialog, e.g. change \"profile.xml\" to \"profile.json\".<br>\nPlease note that duplicate profiles in multiple formats (xml &amp; json) introduce ambiguity when resolving dependencies by canonical url. To prevent this, the Folder Browser always filters on a specific file type, as selected in the Open Folder dialog. The selection is persisted in the recent folder list. Other file type(s) are hidden from the UI and ignored when resolving dependencies. If you save a profile to the current folder using a different format than the active format, then the saved file will not be visible in the Folder Browser. To show the file, re-open the folder using the Open Folder command and select the other format.</p>",
