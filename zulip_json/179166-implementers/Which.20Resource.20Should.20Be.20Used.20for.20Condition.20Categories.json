Condition Category is a grouping used in Risk Adjustment.  The most commonly used among Condition Categories is CMS's HCC (Hierarchical Condition Codes) (More details here <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/medicare/health-plans/medicareadvtgspecratestats/risk-adjustors\">https://www.cms.gov/medicare/health-plans/medicareadvtgspecratestats/risk-adjustors</a>)</p>\n<p>Conceptually these codes are used so insurers and providers can be more appropriately reimbursed for patient's with conditions that require a higher level of care.  In HCC, the predominant measure that puts them in an HCC code is an ICD10 Diagnosis Code.  </p>\n<p>It would be useful for the code(s) that apply to a specific patient to be represented in a way that they could be shared between payers and/or providers.</p>\n<p>Does it belong in Condition?

For example, in the Initial Run for Medicare Advantage Payment Year 2022, ICD code E11.42 maps to HCC 18 <em>and</em> HCC 75 in the CMS-HCC V21 model, HCC 18 in the CMS-HCC V22 model, HCC 18 in the CMS-HCC V24 model, and RxHCC 30 in the CMS-RxHCC V05 model.</p>",

One of the most interesting things is that we have to redocument every year -- in effect the patient's status basically \"resets\" and you have to document appropriately each year to qualify for risk adjustment.</p>\n<p>Couple thoughts I have -- would be curious what others think:</p>\n<p>1) Perhaps HCC's are a claims item -- maybe they belong in a claims resource, rather than the condition resource?</p>\n<p>2) I am very tempted to see if HCC's will fit into a Condition Resource -- this feels like the right way -- I've wondered whether a separate Condition resource should be created for the HCC code, even if this might mean multiple Condition resources for the same condition. But this would allow us to \"reset\" the status of that HCC code every year, and flag it for needing re-documentation.</p>\n<p>2) Or, we could also consider nesting the HCC code under the existing Condition.code element, and allowing people to include multiple codes and code systems there (just like how Procedure resources can include multiple code and code systems for the same procedure resource) Example:</p>\n<p>\"code\" : {<br>\n    \"coding\" : [<br>\n      {<br>\n        \"system\" : \"<a href=\"http://snomed.info/sct\">http://snomed.info/sct</a>\",<br>\n        \"code\" : \"73211009\",<br>\n        \"display\" : \"Diabetes\"<br>\n      }<br>\n      {<br>\n        \"system\" : \"<a href=\"http://cms.gov/hcc\">http://cms.gov/hcc</a>\",<br>\n        \"code\" : \"HCC 18\",<br>\n        \"display\" : \"Diabetes with chronic complications \"<br>\n      }<br>\n]<br>\n}</p>",
