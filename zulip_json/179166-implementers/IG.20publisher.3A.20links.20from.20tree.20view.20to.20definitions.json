Another difference between IG sampler and the FHIR svn examples seems to be that the IG sampler examples have links from the tree view in diff and snapshot to the definitions, whereas when I ran the FHIR svn tests\\ig30 I don't get links. See screenshot. How are these links generated? Can I control if how they are generated?</p>",

        "content": "<p>What Grahame is saying is that the definitions fragment and page should is always generated if you are using the out of the box example.  ( unless you tell the ig-pub not to)  Your ig.json files defines the sd definitions template which will produce the page.  So for ig-sampler I have a template called sd-definitions.html which \"_includes\" this fragment into the template.  In the ig.json file you instruct the SD resource  to create a Definitions page like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>     ....\n    },\n    &quot;StructureDefinition&quot;: {\n      &quot;template-base&quot;: &quot;sd.html&quot;,\n      &quot;template-defns&quot;: &quot;sd-definitions.html&quot;,\n      &quot;template-mappings&quot;: &quot;sd-mappings.html&quot;\n    },\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>But to get the links on the content tree to work - I found that you need to explicitly define the defns fragment for each SD resource like this as well  (actually you don't need the base defined just the defns) :</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>...\n    },\n    &quot;StructureDefinition/template-basic&quot;: {\n      &quot;base&quot;: &quot;StructureDefinition-template-basic.html&quot;,\n      &quot;defns&quot;: &quot;StructureDefinition-template-basic-definitions.html&quot;\n    },\n...\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I  guess should make a tracker for that but since I automated the ig.json file creation I forgot about it...</p>",

For the FHIR svn tests\\ig30 based example I could make it work by simply doing the second part, i.e. give explicit defns in the control file:<br>\n \"StructureDefinition/mypatient\": {<br>\n            \"base\": \"profile-sd-mypatient.html\",<br>\n            \"defns\": \"profile-sd-mypatient-dict.html\"<br>\n        },<br>\nand adding a page with only the StructureDefinition-mypatient-dict.xhtml.<br>\nThat is with definitions on a separate page, which is perfectly fine for me. I could not make it link to the dict included on the same page because this generates hrefs like profile-sd-mypatient.html#Patient.identifier where the target name is not unique and would not jump to the dict section but within the diff or snapshot section. never mind. thanks again!</p>",
