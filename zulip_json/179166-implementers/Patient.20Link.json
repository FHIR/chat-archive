What if the link is of type \"seealso\"?<br>\n2- For patient-everything, should we return resources related to all linked patient resources?<br>\n3- If a user has a permission to access a patient resource, should we assume they automatically have access to other linked patient resources?</p>\n<p>I wounder what approach other people have taken.</p>",
