Are there any widely adopted mechanisms to help maintain sequencing of ADT messages when communicating over a WAN? </p>\n<p>I’m trying to work out how to best manage roughly 1.5 million daily ADT messages into my system over a 40 millisecond (round-trip time) environment. Simply waiting for ACK prior to firing off the next message (how I’ve always seen MLLP implemented) seems to be a problem here. Any implementers have any advice to mitigate the impact of high latencies in high volume environments?</p>",
