        "content": "<p>Hi Everyone!<br>\nMy team is working on the Endpoints logic for Organizations, Locations and HealthcareServices. And we need to clarify some questions. According to the Australian FHIR spec, HealthcareService can have multiple Endpoints. if for example there is the same HealthcareService provided by one Organization on its 3 different Locations, If i request a specific HealthcareService object, and that one has 3 endpoints, then how would I know which one will send the information to which Location, been that Endpoint doesn't have a reference to Location?. For me the fact that a HealthcareService has more than 1 endpoint is kind of confusing, can anyone help me please? thank you :D</p>",

This is really a scope decision and we have remained silent on addressing Location.endpoint which is possible in the FHIR core specification.</p>",
