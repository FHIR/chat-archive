It may be a historical, prospective, or ongoing plan to address some issue. I think of a CarePlan as something like: lose weight, build knee strength, address recurring panic attacks. Care may be delivered with or without a plan. On the other hand an EpisodeOfCare ties together multiple events related to a condition, but doesn't indicate a target. I see them as quite different things.</p>\n<p>In your case, you might be able to argue that the plan is \"figure out what's wrong\", but more realistically, I suspect that once you get the lab results back, a plan for \"treat malignant tumour\" will be created.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't shy away from an extension, especially one which is defined in FHIR core.</p>",
