To achieve it we extended Bundle and serve this. I put up the web tester and it told me that I cannot serve this object. So I thought, is this wrong? In the specc you'll find many \"custom\" resources, but they are basically extending FHIR defined objects I.G AllergyIntolerance. We are using the Spring Boot implementation with hapifhir. That's why I extended a CriticalInformation object to achieve the endpoint. Is our strategy wrong or are there alternatives to doing this? Any pointers would be appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks, <br>\n// Thomas</p>\n<p>Our specc: <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/KritiskInfo/CriticalInformation/~overview\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://simplifier.net/KritiskInfo/CriticalInformation/~overview\">https://simplifier.net/KritiskInfo/CriticalInformation/~overview</a></p>",

        "content": "<p>Right, that's what put me off. But is the method of extending the classes correct, or am I supposed to do it otherwise? Reference to the endpoint is due to the @Read annotation that parses my getRerouceType of CriticalInformation.class to a REST endpoint of \"/CriticalInformation/@IdParam\". And about the conformant issue, can I move around this? Seems a waste to lose web tester possibilities when I only extend Bundle and serve it up. That's why I'm thinking this is wrong.

These extension elements can be profiled to allow conveying pretty much any additional data you wish - while remaining conformant with the base FHIR schemas and remaining interoperable with other FHIR systems.

However the risk exists with GET URL parameters just as much as with POST search parameter content. There is misunderstanding that persists to this day that URL parameters are bad. There is indeed a risk that a URL might be stored or propagated by a human, but so too any other way that human gets data. URL GET parameters are only bad when exposed, but as Grahame points out those that have the authority to get a proper URL with parameters would  be the HUMAN to expose that URL. That HUMAN is just as likely to expose the parameters (or resulting data).   Applications, vs browsers, can prevent the HUMAN from this</p>",

Others worry about proxy servers, but with proper TLS and trust-store management, there is no exposure; and GET is just as exposed as POST in those cases.</p>",
