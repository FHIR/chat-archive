The Service Base URL takes the form of</p>\n<p>http{s}://server{/path}</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The spec goes on to say \"All URLs (and ids that form part of the URL) defined by this specification are case sensitive\".</p>\n<p>For example, is FHIR saying that these two are NOT to be considered the the same thing?<br>\n<a href=\"http://myserver:8080/mypath1/Patient/123\">http://myserver:8080/mypath1/Patient/123</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://myserver:8080/MYPATH1/Patient/123\">http://myserver:8080/MYPATH1/Patient/123</a></p>\n<p>I do not mean to argue one way or the other, just want to make sure I understand correctly.</p>",
