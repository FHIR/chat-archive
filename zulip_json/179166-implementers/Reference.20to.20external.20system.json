A/B is responsible for managing mapping between their patients and the one in C.</p>\n<p>What is the expected behavior if A sends references that are irrelevant for other systems (both B &amp; C) into C? For instance, when sending AllergyIntolerance of a patient, A includes reference to patient which is valid for neither B nor C.</p>\n<p>Should C ignore the value? or keep a mapping somewhere so that A can understand it later? What is the right approach to take?</p>\n<p>Please advice</p>",
