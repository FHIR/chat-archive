We created our custom Payment entity and PaymentAllocate entity, which binds a payment or parts of the payment with the particular Invoices/ChargeItems. <br>\nWe could propose  Payment and PaymentAllocate resources if there is any requirement for them, and any relevant feedback/ use cases would be very helpful!</p>",
