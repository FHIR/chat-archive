So the value is a rate quantity (Observation.valueQuantity) for \"missed beats per minute\" with a unit of \"beats per minute\"?  You would need to find (or request/create, if needed) codes for the observation (Observation.code - most likely a LOINC code) and the unit (Observation.valueQuantity.code - UCUM).  That's really off the top of my head (without doing any looking), but I think it probably shouldn't be too far off.</p>",
