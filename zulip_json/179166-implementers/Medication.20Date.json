So MedicationStatement's search date should be based on effective.</p>\n<p>2 - This would be an opportunity to align the names of MedicationAdministration.effectiveTime[x] and MedicationStatement.effective[x].</p>\n<p>3 - The information that can be held by the combined data elements <strong>effectiveDateTime</strong> and <strong>effectivePeriod</strong> can also be held by two different data elements <strong>date</strong> and <strong>duration</strong>. That design would give a common <strong>date</strong> data element for searching without adding an extra data element just for searching.</p>",

I'd add one more to this (maybe it's already been discussed in the Pharmacy committee):  What does 'effective-time' mean (no matter what it's called) when you have an infusion with both a start and end time (effectivePeriod) for the administration?   Do MedAdmin's need a different query parameter or an additional one to handle this?  [I don't see a search parameter for effectivePeriod]</p>",
