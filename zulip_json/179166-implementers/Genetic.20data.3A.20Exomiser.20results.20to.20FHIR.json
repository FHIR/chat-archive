I am doing a genetic data mapping and would like to know if anyone has worked with this before.</p>\n<p>After running exomiser (<a href=\"https://exomiser.github.io/Exomiser/\">https://exomiser.github.io/Exomiser/</a>) with a set of symptoms and VCF files I get the gene information for a particular case. In this result I have data from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gene identifier</li>\n<li>Mode of inheritance</li>\n<li>Some scores: combined, phenotype and variant.</li>\n<li>Contributing variants: chromosome, position, ref and alt, frequency data, variant effect, clinVar data (alleleId, interpretations, reviewStatus), etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From what I have read so far, the genetic information is stored in \"Observation\" resources: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-genetic.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-genetic.html</a>. And that this also has several extensions that I could use.</p>\n<p>Would I have to map all my values by hand or does anyone know if there is anything I can use to automate it?</p>\n<p>With all the observation resources created for a patient,  then I would have to create a \"DiagnosticReport-genetics Profile\" resource that points to all of the above, is that right?</p>\n<p>Thank you very much!</p>",
