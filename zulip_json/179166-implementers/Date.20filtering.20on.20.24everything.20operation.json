To account for that, the period that it spans is used for performing the search. So date=2016-11 will range from Nov 1st up to Nov 30th.</p>\n<p>But that does not allow you to express a period from let's say May 2016 to April 2017. To express that, you need start &amp; end date. Those will both be expanded to periods, so if you specify start=2016-05&amp;end=2017-04, it will range from the lower end of start (May 1st ) to the upper end of end (April 30th).</p>\n<p>That being said it would be a nice addition to clarify which of the dates in resources in the Patient compartment qualify as 'care date'.</p>",
