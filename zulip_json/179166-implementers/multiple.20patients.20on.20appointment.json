Was and is it the intention that appointments should/could be shared among patients, and if that is indeed the case, shouldn't it have been modelled as a reference to a Group resource instead? This puzzles me especially as I'm in the case of having to model appointments with multiple patients as participants. As I'm about to make the design of group appointments (and the surrounding security model) I would very much like to know the original intention regarding having multiple patients on a single appointment. I imagine someone from the PA WG could have a good response?</p>",
