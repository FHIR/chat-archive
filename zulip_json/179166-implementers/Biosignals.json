Biosignals are a own class of data. Biosignals are somewhere in between (in terms of size) of imaging data, and laboratory data, and they require and ask for its own tools (e.g. viewer) and analysis methods. </p>\n<p>In order to analyze and view the sample data, Biosig provides a number of bindings to programming platforms that can handle signal data very well (e.g. matlab, octave, R, python, ...), and \"libbiosig\" is also included in viewers like sigviewer or stimfit. <br>\nThe project \"Biosig\" provides tools to wrap biosignal data into HL7 FHIR binary templates [2], and to extract the header information (i.e. meta-information) in JSON, XML or ASCII format. For more information, you can use the biosig command line tools \"save2gdf\" and \"biosig_fhir\". There are also examples how to use them from within perl and php. </p>\n<p>We define a common data structure (meta-, or headerinformation, data samples, events and annotations) for biosignals, the serialized format is defined in [3], and can be extracted with the Biosignal tools mentioned above [1].
