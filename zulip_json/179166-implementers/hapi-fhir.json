When you define some value sets, you don't want to list all of the possible codes because the list is too long, and in some cases, changes regularly.  In some cases, the list of codes even varies by where you are (though SNOMED is the only code system I'm aware of that behaves that way).  For example, you might define a value set that says \"All SNOMED drug codes\".  That's going to evaluate to a different set of codes today than it did 6 months ago.  It's also going to resolve differently in the UK than it does in Japan or in Canada.  The 'expand' operation gives you the set of codes in the value set for the date and other metadata you specify.  Sometimes the expansion itself is too big.  (An expand on all of SNOMED would be enormous.)  The expand operation allows you to filter what codes you get back or to page through the set of codes.</p>",
