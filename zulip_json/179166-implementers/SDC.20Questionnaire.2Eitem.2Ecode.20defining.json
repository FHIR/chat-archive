I think the answer is R4 ObservationDefinition and this links to a ValueSet? </p>\n<p>The ObservationDefinition.(x)ValueSet would have a SNOMED ecl which looks like:  <br>\n&lt;&lt;300387008 |Finding of bowel continence Code| <br>\n&lt;&lt;106138009 |Learning finding|</p>\n<p>If my Observations don't have a valueCodeableConcept, the link to ObservationDefinition still works. So I'm thinking I need to create an extension on Questionnaire.item.code which links to a ObservationDefinition (unless one already exists?). </p>\n<p>I'm also tempted to add an extension for ObservationDefinition.validCodedValueSet and ObservationDefinition.validCodedValueSet which gives a hint to the SNOMED ecl query (to avoid multiple calls and also be used to auto generate the ValueSet).</p>",
