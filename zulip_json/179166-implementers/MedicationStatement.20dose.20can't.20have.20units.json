The dose in MedicationStatement which we would like to add units to is a SimpleQuantity rather than a Quantity, so it does not contain a unit. My coworker investigated and found an example to put our value all the way in the denominator of the maxDosePerPeriod ratio which is a Quantity type that can have the unit on it. This seems fairly hacky to us though and seems like it would be much simpler if the dose field were Quantities rather than SimpleQuantity.</p>",
