If you have metadata that's important for someone looking at a resource to know, then it needs to be specified directly on the resource - even if it means repeating identical information on hundreds of resources.  If the metadata is only relevant to the 'collection' but not to the individual resources, then putting it on something like List makes sense.  Metadata on Bundle would be specific to a particular delivery package.  For most types of Bundles, it wouldn't necessarily be retained once the Bundle had been received and processed (message, batch, transaction).</p>",
