The concepts seems to have some ambiguity. Should we be interpreting these concepts as defined by clinical criteria rather than billing practices? E.g., \"outpatient\" as defined for hospital outpatient services is not specifically covered, and (2) virtual includes email, telemedicine and robotic procedures. How can we specify / differentiate we want to express telemedicine (not the other choices). From the definition of extensible we can't include a code for telemedicine because it is covered in Virtual - can the value set be expanded and updated.</p>",
