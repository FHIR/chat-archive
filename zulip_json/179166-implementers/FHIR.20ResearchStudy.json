The \"enrollment\" field is where the inclusion and exclusion criteria are placed as a Reference to a Group. Unfortunately, the inclusion and exclusion criteria are an unformatted text blob that would be too much work to format properly to place into the Group. Where is the correct location to place the unformatted text in the Reference to the Group object?</p>",

The enrollment criteria for a ResearchStudy is defined within a referenced Group.   The matching service returns the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the clinical trial as a single lump of text (this looks to be taken directly from <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov\">clinicaltrials.gov</a>). </p>\n<p>In this case there is not a reference-able Group object from the ct matching service so a self contained Group resource seems out of the question.   That leaves a contained resource.   The first thought was to simply create the contained Group resource and add the enrollment criteria to the 'text' attribute of that resource.  The issue with that is that the FHIR spec states that contained resources should not have a narrative section. The characteristic attribute of the group appears unsuitable for a blob of text.   Then there is the notion of simply using the display attribute of the Group reference but that feels a bit ugly as well.  </p>\n<p>If anyone has some thoughts or guidance on where the best place to place this information it would be approciated.</p>",
