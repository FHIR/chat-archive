There was no error message, and the dialog box stayed open.  It wasn't until I opened the developer tools that I saw a message in the console that said \"Work group must not be empty\".  I returned to the dialog box and could not find a \"work group\" field-- until I thought to click on the \"advanced\" tab, where I found it, and was finally able to create the ticket.</p>",
