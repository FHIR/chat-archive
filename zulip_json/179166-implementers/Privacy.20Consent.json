The variance between this and a traditional parent role being that in biological families your dad is pretty much your dad for your lifetime while in the case of Foster Children the person in the legal guardian role can change relatively frequently for Foster Children (or similar types of individuals that are effectively wards of the state).  I have no experience regarding the role of the prison system in regards to prisoners but presume that an incarcerates person's rights may be restrained and wouldn't be surpirsed if it changed from state to state or type of sentence or some other attributes.  </p>",

Meaning when a role changes, the data changes to reflect that new role. Or when authorization changes, the record changes to indicate the change of authorization. So for example if there was not an expiration, but circumstances call for a change of the authorized representative; then I would deprecate (we don't yet have a state in Contract, but have discussed it), and record a new Contract (Consent). (In XDS this is done simply by replacing the former with a new consent, where the replace operator logically deprecates).</p>",
