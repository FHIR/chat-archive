That sounds like a <del>MedicationReference</del> MedicationRequest, but I saw the following in the documentation of that resource:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When reporting on the usage of a medication by a patient, the MedicationStatement resource should be used.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the <code>reportedReference</code> can point to a Patient to indicate how the information was reported.</p>\n<p>My interpretation is that insofar the patient is reporting directly about a prescription, MedicationRequest with <code>reportedReference</code> pointing to the Patient is the right choice. Information about the medicine actually dispensed and taken would go in other resources, e.g. MedicationStatement. Is that understanding correct?</p>",
