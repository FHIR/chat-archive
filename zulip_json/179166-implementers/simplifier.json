So yes, this tool can be used to generate (statically) the page you see at qicore-medication.html, but you need to also create an Implementation Guide resource as well. So, this is -as yet- quite involved. At Simplifier we are working to make this easier (indeed rendering this directly in Simplifier), but we're not there yet. So your best bet for this week would be to download the fhir spec source, copy &amp; paste an existing Implementation Guide, copy your StrcutrueDefinition into it and run the build tool.</p>",
