In USCoreR4 build the DiagnosticReport-note seems to be an appropriate way to indicate the types of study performed with a status of final, amended, corrected or appended and a result referencing specific observations with their respective LOINC codes.  [Examples - Ejection Fraction in an ultrasound study; fetal size/gestational age as a finding in a fetal ultrasound).  Is this an appropriate way to model requests for such results, or might it be better to request a separate Observation for each (noting that the observation would likely require use of the FHIR R4 resource since USCore R4 profiles only specific observations?  Or should a request for such data include BOTH options to assure retrieving all results?</p>",
