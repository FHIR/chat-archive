The 11-digit codes are an unofficial derivative format that is used by drug database vendors and others.  I think it's a better and more useful format, but it's an alternative code representation and not the primary one.  We could possibly add an additional representation that uses the 11-digit format - maybe as a separate code system, like \"NDC/NHRIC 11-digit Codes (unofficial)‚Äù?  But I don't know if we should.</p>",

In our case we are dealing with medication information that is sourced from ePrescribing related data so it would be helpful to just be able to leave it in it's original format. I'm not sure if there is a definitive way for us to go from the 11 digit code to 10 digit unless I'm missing something. At least for a company like Surescripts the 11 digit variety is much more common, but I'm not sure how that came to be the case. I'm guessing the use of drug databases would make sense there. </p>",

And you are right that there is no deterministic way to transform from the 11 digit codes back to the 10 digit.  But I would do that in reverse.  It's a simple algorithm to transform from 10 to 11 digits - you just pad the \"short\" group (it will be either the first or the second group of digits) to the maximum length with a leading '0' and then remove the dashes.  For doing comparisons that can be done on the fly using a simple function or you can cache a table with the full 11 digit codes locally.  Or, if we think it really is needed, we still could entertain the possibility of creating a FHIR code system for the 11 digit codes.</p>",

In our case our source of data is 11 digits so there's no way for us to get back to 10, I think we would be required to create an extension to send our data.

For NDC code system, the recommended field to use for the display value (returned by the $validate-code extended operation,  for example) is the <code>PACKAGEDESCRIPTION</code> from the <code>package.txt</code> file. However, this field provides dosage information and is useless as a display value. The <code>PROPRIETARYNAME</code>, <code>PROPRIETARYNAMESUFFIX</code>, and <code>NONPROPRIETARYNAME</code> fields from the <code>product.txt</code>file are much more descriptive display names.
