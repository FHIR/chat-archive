While performing the implementyation of US Core Medication Profile, I came across with the  Medication.code element where FHIR Binding value is : <strong>US Core Medication Codes (RxNorm) (extensible)</strong>. However, my client maintained the <strong>NDC medication </strong> coding standard. My question to the group is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is it <strong>allowable to use NDC code</strong> with the system value as: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/ndc\">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/ndc</a> ? OR</li>\n<li>We need to <strong>convert all the existing NDC code set to Rx Norm</strong> before sending.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For question # 1, my interpretation for any extensible binding was if a code is not present in the defined Value set (recommended by FHIR for that element), we may use other VS with proper System details. Having said that, if a client does not want to do all these conversion (as it require a good amount of effort), can they use NDC code ?</p>\n<p>For question # 2, we have an RxNorm provided API available - <strong>https://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/RxNormAPIs.html#</strong> ; can we suggest client to use this or create a repository (kind of a translation table) and maintain it.</p>\n<p>Requesting your assistance on this.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nAritra</p>",
