I had assumed that VA extensions would use <a href=\"http://www.va.gov/fhir/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.va.gov/fhir/\">http://www.va.gov/fhir/</a>, but all the popular kids are using <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/fhir/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hl7.org/fhir/\">http://www.hl7.org/fhir/</a>.<br>\n1. Does that require any sort of permission or licensing?<br>\n2. Does it have any implementation implications?</p>",
