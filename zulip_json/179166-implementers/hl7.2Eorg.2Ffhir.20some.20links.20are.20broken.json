In summary, the responsible work group will review the proposed change, generally on a conference call and make a decision.  If you flag the element as \"in person\", they'll try to make sure they discuss it at a time you're able to attend.  If a decision is made to change the spec, someone will eventually make it in the continuous integration environment.  Eventually the specification will go out for a formal ballot review (which may drive eventual changes) and finally a new official version will be published.  We're currently targeting R5 for Q1 2021.</p>",
