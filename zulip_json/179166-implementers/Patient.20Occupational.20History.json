The material enclosed in curly braces is called annotation.   ■2 Annotations do not contribute to the semantics of the unit but are meaningless by definition. Therefore, any fully conformant parser must discard all annotations. Parsers of limited conformace should not value annotations in comparison of units.   ■3 Annotations do, however, signify the end of a unit symbol.   ■4 An annotation without a leading symbol implies the default unit 1 (the unity).   ■5 Curly braces must not be nested.</p>\n<p>Curly braces are here because people want annotations and deeply believe that they need annotations. Especially in chemistry and biomedical sciences, there are traditional habits to write annotations at units or instead of units, such as “%vol.”, “RBC”, “CFU”, “kg(wet tis.)”, or “mL(total)”. These habits are hard to overcome. Any attempt of a coding scheme to restrict this percieved expressiveness will ultimately result in the coding scheme not being adopted, or just “half-way” adopted (which is as bad as not adopted).</p>\n<p>Two alternative responses to this reality exist: either give in to the bad habits and blow up of the code with dimension- and meaningless unit atoms, or canalize this habit so that it does no harm. The Unified Code for Units of Measure canalizes this habit using curly braces. Nevertheless we do continuing efforts to upgrade doubtful units to genuine units of The Unified Code for Units of Measure by defining and linking them to the other units as good as possible. Thus, “g%” is a valid metric unit atom (so that “mg%” is a valid unit too.) A drops, although quite imprecise, is a valid unit of volume “[drp]”. Even HPF and LPF (the so called “high-” and “low power field” in the microscope) have been defined so that at least they relate to each other.</p>",
