Any specific reason why the resourcename i.e. <code>Condition</code> is not present? </p>\n<p>There are times when we are doing some task when Condition.category gives a validation-error, but we don't want same for ProcedureRequest.Category. The exisiting message was easy to distinguish but now it's not possible. </p>",
