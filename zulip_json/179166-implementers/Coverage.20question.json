Observation seems a little klugey. CoverageEligibilityResponse sounds right, but it, too, bakes in a lot of spurious metadata, and one of the approaches would use Coverage in there, too. (Or we could DAR out the Coverage or provide a boilerplate display text and use one of the insurance.item codes - category or type.)<br>\nIs anyone else facing a similar question?</p>",
