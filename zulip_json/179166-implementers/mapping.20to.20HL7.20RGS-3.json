I see in the FHIR spec that there is a Location reference in the Appointment.participant property, but in the HL7 mapping, I see that it only maps to the Appointment Information Segments (AIP, AIG, AIL). Could someone point me in the right direction on where we should map the RGS-3 field in the FHIR spec? </p>",
