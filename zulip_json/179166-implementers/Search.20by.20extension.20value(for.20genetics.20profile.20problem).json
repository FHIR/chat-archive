One of the task of this project is allowing user to search by Gene name from the FHIR server and get all the possible result. Since Gene was stored in the Observation-genetics profile as an extension. And based on other related post, creating a customer search parameter will be the solution of this problem. <br>\nI wonder if anyone have a full step about how to create the search parameter? both by HAPI library and by Restful request?<br>\nBecause some of my team mates are not able to read and use computer code, they would like to use the HAPI fhir server UI to create the customer parameter directly. Wonder if it is possible to do this either right now or in the future?</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nThanks,<br>\nXin</p>",

        "content": "<p>I'm not sure I'm following the first question.  For the second, it would be hard for servers to support unless they use FHIR as their underlying persistence layer.  Extensions could map to a wide variety of elements possibly appearing in different tables, many of which wouldn't necessarily make sense to search on or index.  Servers would only be able to claim support for the parameter if they supported matching on absolutely every possible extension they persist.  Few systems would thus be able to claim support for it.  Defining individual search parameters provides more fine-grained control - the server can choose to index and support search by what they wish.</p>",
