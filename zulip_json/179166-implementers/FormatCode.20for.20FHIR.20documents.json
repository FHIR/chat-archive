So right now FHIR documents in a DocumentReference would need only be specified using a mimeType.  see <a href=\"https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2017/01/fhir-documents-in-xds.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2017/01/fhir-documents-in-xds.html\">https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2017/01/fhir-documents-in-xds.html</a> But eventually we will get to more refined 'profiles', implementationGuides, and StructureDefinitions for documents. At that time it becomes more obvious what to use for mimeType.  The recommendation of using the URI of the StructureDefinition is a good one. If one doesn't have a profile, then I guess the degenerate form is indeed the StructureDefinition from the core FHIR specification.</p>",
