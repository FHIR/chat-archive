Based on your feedback I also tried Chrome and there it is good. Not sure if Safari could also be forced through some header on the web server or some encoding flag in the JSON to see this properly. I have found some pointers that setting the Content-Type header from \"application/json\" to \"application/json; charset=utf8\" might do the trick.</p>",

That worked! I guess in the long-run it would still be good if the HL7 webmaster sent out a more complete header, to make it more reliable for everybody. But this helped. Also explains why I was sometimes seeing weird Copyright symbols in some of the other JSON content.</p>",
