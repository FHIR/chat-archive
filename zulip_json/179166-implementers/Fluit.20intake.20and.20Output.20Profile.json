I'm not completely on board with this assumption, but it's how I understand LOINC and UCUM work. I say DURATION versus RATE because there are exsisting LOINC codes focused on rate, such as 8976-3  Fluid intake intravascular 1 hour which has a unit that assumes a per hour rate and not so much a duration that communicates a specific single hour duration. I wonder how we communicate a specific duration when a specific start and end is not known. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> - can you help me understand how this is to be done?</p>",

I agree LOINC typically expects the duration to be pre-coordinated.  However, sometimes \"non-standard\" durations get used and sometimes people use code systems other than LOINC.  So a new data element is probably reasonable.</p>",
