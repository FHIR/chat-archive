If the patient's state has reached the possibility of the checkout you would show a button within an app for reminding the patient to sign some document. Without hypermedia the clients checks specific properties like treatmentDone, doctorInformed or more complex, implicit business logic. If you use a hypermedia link, the client just checks for presence or absence, never doing any complex conditional checks. You don't need to alter the client if this process changes. It only checks for the corresponding \"action-link\" within the hypermedia metadata. Sorry, if this sounds a bit fuzzy, I am an IT-guy starting to research digital health.</p>",
