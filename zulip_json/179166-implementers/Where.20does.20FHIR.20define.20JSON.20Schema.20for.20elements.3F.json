Unfortunately, I can't resolve \"Element.schema.json\" or any other similar refs on these pages. Is anyone familiar with where they live? </p>\n<p>I would download the bulk JSON schema that has everything, but my organization requires the files be broken up by resource so that custom definitions we already have can be defined in a similar manner, and ones we haven't defined can be omitted. This is also important for the code review and team ownership systems associated with our source control (Git), where these will live. </p>\n<p>If anyone knows where I can find these files, or better ways to do what I'm doing, I'd love to know both answers.</p>",
