I've seen Open mHealth IG but I'm not sure if this is not outdated?</li>\n<li>In the Open mHealth IG I think they use some kind of middleman when converting to fhir, flow seems to be like this: data -&gt; OmH  (the middleman) -&gt; FHIR. I couldn't find any example where the data was converted straight to resources without any changes in the middle, if i know the structure of data is it okay to map it straight to FHIR? I don't really understand the purpose of any middleman here...<br>\nThanks in advance! <br>\nLukas</li>\n</ol>",
