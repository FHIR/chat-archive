Before that is finalized we would like to get feedback whether there is any consideration at this time, or use of an extension already, where Observation.value[x] contemplates the use of valueStatistics essentially, or already is doing so.<br>\nThe leaning in the Orders and Observation workgroup discussion is that there is no intent and that a use case where Statistics context is relevant it can be done outside Observation.value[x], e.g., introducing by extension or core attribute Observation.analysis Reference(Evidence).  We are not aware of such a use case at this time though.</p>\n<p>Any input on current/future plans will help determine whether OO should or should not support the JIRA's proposal.</p>",
