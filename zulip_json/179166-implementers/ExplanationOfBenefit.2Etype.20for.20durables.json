        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191912\">@Michele Mottini</span> for the ExplanationOfBenefit.type the simple answer is you should probably use the same value as is recorded on the related Claim. The answer becomes somewhat more complex when you don't have the original Claim or are also creating the Claim.  If the device was provided in or during a hospital stay, this would be an institutional type, from a doctor's office, a professional and finally from a pharmacy, a pharmacy type. The type is indicative of the business practices for that section of the business domain. Hospitals (institutional) want to send everything at once, dozens of items including pharmaceuticals, services and sundry items. Pharmacies usually send claims with single items (visiting a pharmacy to get 3 prescriptions filled will result in 3 separate claims). Hope this helps</p>",
