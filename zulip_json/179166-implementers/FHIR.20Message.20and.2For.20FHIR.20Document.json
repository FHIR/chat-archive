Both the message and clinical documents interactions are supporting workflow and would want to suggest standardisation on one style. <br>\nOne thought would be to use FHIR Messaging focused on ServiceRequest with the supportingInformation being a FHIR Document. This puts the focus on the Referral/Service Request, some of the interactions won't contain supportingInformation (no clinical document) plus it decouples the core message from the letter. </p>\n<p>Q. Would the common resources (Patient, Encounter, etc) be duplicated. Once in the FHIR Message bundle and again in the FHIR Document Bundle OR can I do this inline (so no separate FHIR Document Bundle). </p>\n<p>I tempted to go with inline (no FHIR Document). It would be desirable to support FHIR Documents, I like the linking to structured resources but I'm not seeing this done in practice.</p>",
