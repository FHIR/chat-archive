Hl7 can (and should) define URLs for these, though \"state license number\" won't be a single URL - it'll probably be many hundreds unless each state assigns all provider license numbers from a single pool of numbers (from massage therapists to surgeons to dental hygenists).  And even then, you'd have a separate URL for each state.  To get standard URLs defined, use the 'propose a change' link.</p>",
