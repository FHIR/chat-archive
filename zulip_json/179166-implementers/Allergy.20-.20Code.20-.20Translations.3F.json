        "content": "<p>Hello - </p>\n<p>I'm sorry if this is a naive question. Am I correct in reading that <code>AllergyIntollerance</code> is intended to support one and only one substance/product through <code>code</code> and does not support multiple codes? EX: I can have a single RxNorm term, but not a mapped NDC in addition. If I wanted to do that I'd instead create a second AllergyIntolerance record or express more granular (or even potentially translations) through the <code>reaction</code> entries through <code>reaction.substance</code>?</p>\n<p>Mainly asking so I can ensure I'm understanding this correctly.</p>\n<p>Per <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/allergyintolerance-definitions.html\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/allergyintolerance-definitions.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/allergyintolerance-definitions.html</a> </p>\n<p>AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Note: the substance for a specific reaction may be different from the substance identified as the cause of the risk, but it must be consistent with it. For instance, it may be a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a composite product that includes the identified substance. It must be clinically safe to only process the &#39;code&#39; and ignore the &#39;reaction.substance&#39;.\n...\nThe &#39;code&#39; element allows for the use of a specific substance or pharmaceutical product, or a group or class of substances. In the case of an allergy or intolerance to a class of substances, (for example, &quot;penicillins&quot;), the &#39;reaction.substance&#39; element could be used to code the specific substance that was identified as having caused the reaction (for example, &quot;amoxycillin&quot;). Duplication of the value in the &#39;code&#39; and &#39;reaction.substance&#39; elements is acceptable when a specific substance has been recorded in &#39;code&#39;.\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Am I understanding that correctly?</p>",

I was just looking at the ordinality reference and didn't think past <code>0..1</code> to notice CodeableConcept and recognize it included multiple codes. /facepalm</p>",
