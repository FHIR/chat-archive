Patient.name.given if I use us-core-patient profile.<br>\nBut after the careful review of the data type â€“ HumanName, it looks like neither is a good choice.</p>\n<p>Please advise <span aria-label=\"blush\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f60a\" role=\"img\" title=\"blush\">:blush:</span><br>\nThank you!!!</p>\n<p>Olga Vovk<br>\n&lt;:3)))~~~~</p>",
