If you split the admissions process into a separate encounter from that of the various department visits, I suspect you'll have an encompassing encounter that groups them all.  There's no standard scheme for assigning identifiers - any more than there's a standard scheme for what constitutes a distinct encounter and when or how to use sub-encounters.  FHIR allows conveying whatever business concepts you have, but we're a long way from trying to standardize business practices even in a single country, let alone across all types of healthcare and all countries.</p>",
