For example, if possible one should ensure that 'reference data' (code systems, value sets, other core registries such a MPIs or Medication registries) already contain translated descriptions.  </p>\n<p>Automatic translation (at run time, when queried for data) is risky from a patient safety perspective. If one were to do so, one would have to clearly designate that translation as being a automatic translation (and hence: less reliable).</p>",
