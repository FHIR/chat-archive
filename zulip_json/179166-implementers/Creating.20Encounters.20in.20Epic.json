Alternatively, can I enter Observations (flowsheets) without an open Encounter?

Depending on what type of flowsheet data, there can be different solutions.  For example, patient-entered flowsheets, or flowsheet data collected from a patient device can file to episodes rather than encounters.  For clinical data in flowsheets, you'll probably want to match to an existing encounter, as one should be open already if there is a system collecting clinical data in-clinic (or hospital).  For risk scores, we have other options.</p>",
