Simplifier has an agreement to host all HL7 international-developed content for free, but I believe you'd need a license to host your national content.  We're exploring allowing HL7 affiliates the ability to use HL7's Jira tool for tracking issues related to national IGs, including balloting, but we haven't actually done so for anything other than U.S. IGs (which are a bit of an anomaly due to how HL7 works).  The HL7 confluence site is read-only except to 'managers', but HL7 could grant access to an affiliate-specific 'space' to host national documentation.</p>",
