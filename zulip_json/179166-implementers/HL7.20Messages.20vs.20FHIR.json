Reason I ask is because we have existing telehealth databases and remote monitoring health devices that are generating data and we want to change the end point of the HL7 messages to utilize a FHIR-compliant MongoDB database. We are trying to get an idea for if FHIR can easily digest HL7 messages. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi Lauren, I believe by \"HL7\" you mean \"HL7 v2\" messages as HL7 is a set of standards, e.g. HL7 v3, CDA, FHIR, etc. If so, there is no magic bullet - you would either have to build an adapter to map HL7 v2 to FHIR or to use a commercial Interface Engine that supports such mapping.  You can see an example of suggested mappings at <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/observation-mappings.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/observation-mappings.html\">http://build.fhir.org/observation-mappings.html</a>, but every HL7 v2 spec is \"unique\" (i.e. not really standard) and you will need to know well each data element of the current HL7 v2 messages to figure out the best mapping to FHIR (including terminology mapping).</p>",

Also, thanks for clarifying the effort for mapping between standards! I see from the example link the complexity here from HL7 v2. Our client seems to think mapping the existing messages to FHIR will be an easy task and I want to make sure I can tactfully explain why this is not the case.</p>",

We are mapping the UI fields to FHIR resource fields for the first of possibly 4+ applications for the first time now and fully expect to reuse this mapping for the next applications. Expect similar efforts to occur with the remote medical device data that currently utilizes messaging.</p>",
