Something where I could group the patients by social security number and then filter down to only show groups that have 2 or more results.</p>\n<p>This is a simple database query, but the underlying database isn’t available to me. I’ve looked extensively through the specification and other online resources, but haven’t found anything promising to do this via the FHIR REST API. </p>\n<p>Do I have any options? Or am I trying to fit a square FHIR peg into a round SQL hole? Any feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thank you,<br>\nTaylor</p>",
