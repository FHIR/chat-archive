For example, if there is a code for a Tonselectomy, CPT woud tell you not to combine that code with Incision prpcedure because an incision is included in the scope of the Tonselectomy code.  These rules are called \"parentheticals\" and appear in the CPT book and can also be found in a machine processable version of CPT called CPT Link.</li>\n<li>Each payer organization will also specify, per there payment policies, when codes can and can't be combined.  This is independent of CPT.

The syntax obviously needs to be consistent with the guidance in the CPT manual and the way that this is being done in practice, and ideally and hopefully it should be approved by the AMA (the owner/publisher of CPT).  I expect that the syntax would be something like \"include the codes (only 2 max?) separated by a specified character\".
