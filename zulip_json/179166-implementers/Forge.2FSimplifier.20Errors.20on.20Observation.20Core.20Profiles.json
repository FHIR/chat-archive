This also happens for Weight and BMI (and presumably for other profiles derived from vitalsigns). Simplifier has a similar error and renders both a value[x] and a valueQuantity (also of type [x]) field an the same level.</p>",

FHIR R4 introduces new rules for type slicing and the current Forge R4 implementation is not yet fully compliant. I'm currently working on improving the R4 SnapshotGenerator in the .NET FHIR library. This issue will be fixed in the next Forge release, scheduled for the September HL7 WGM.</p>\n<p>FYI: <a href=\"https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhir-net-api/issues/1074\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhir-net-api/issues/1074\">https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhir-net-api/issues/1074</a></p>",
