Grahame did suggest using .focus for some of the Observations where the parent may not have a Patient record (eg. you need an observation about the father's education level or the information is about the Mother but she's not actually a patient (eg. the birth was at another location but the current provider is collecting the data for their uses). In this case, .focus could point to the person's RelatedPerson resource</p>",

We use an observation-gestational-age-at-delivery (subject = baby or fetus) for gestation estimate (37 weeks)  and another Vital Sign Observation (Observation-birth-weight) (subject = baby or fetus) for birth/delivery weight.</p>\n<p>We don't actually model the Pregnancy in BFDR, but we do in eCR and there will be a Public Health common profile for that (subject = mother): <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-us-ph-common-library-ig/StructureDefinition-lib-copy-us-ph-pregnancy-status-observation.html\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-us-ph-common-library-ig/StructureDefinition-lib-copy-us-ph-pregnancy-status-observation.html</a>. There is also a Pregnancy Outcome profile in that common library. (BTW - the PH common library isn't a project yet, so it's not possible to simply reference any of the profiles - for now we are making copies of them to use in various IGs - hopefully will go to ballot in Jan 22).</p>\n<p>In BFDR we follow the guidance here to relate everything: <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html#maternity\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html#maternity</a></p>",
