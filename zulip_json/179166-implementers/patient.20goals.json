Is there a specific FHIR resource that can be used to registrate 'patients goals' or do we use the GOAL resource? I think the GOAL to be more care related. Life goals on the other hand are difficult to structure.. </p>\n<p>I explain myself: </p>\n<p>If a person that is suffering diabetes lives towards weekly dates with her friends to play cards and EAT CAKE, his/her treatment should be adapted in this way that it is still possible to participate in these dates (let's say to prevent depression). </p>\n<p>This information,  a 'patient narrative' or what we call 'life goals' are very important to know but not always on the agenda of health care actors. We need to establish a workflow in which it becomes naturally for care actors to ask about these things, or even make it possible that patients can add this by themself in a careplan. But which FHIR resource should be used then? Anybody has some ideas/experiences?</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n<p>Kr,<br>\nHanne</p>",

Example I use in training courses is someone being concerned about losing their hair. <br>\nGiven the tight links between Condition, Goal and CarePlan I'd fully expect the same sort of flexibility of usage. After all, it's pretty arrogant for one party to state that someone's concern is of no relevance, or that it should not be captured.</p>",

There's an extension that allows the capture of 'acceptance' of a stated goal by other stakeholders.  It's entirely possible that different stakeholders will have different goals.  What the provider wants, the mom wants and the patient wants could all be in conflict.  Still worth documenting.</p>",

Of course... insofar as goals may relate to care <strong>guidelines</strong>... a key goal of the operators of a <strong>care delivery network</strong> (e.g. an HMO, or a jurisdictional government that operates a publicly-funded care network, or VHA, etc.) is to try to operationalize guideline-adherent care as far as it is possible to do so. Improved guideline-adherence leads, as the literature shows, to improved population health outcomes. </p>\n<p>It is natural to have a tension between a smoker that enjoys smoking (and so wants to keep doing it) or a person that enjoys eating cake (and wants to keep doing it) and a clinician that is trying to help that person to become more healthy. I'm not sure the role of informatics in addressing this tension -- except to faithfully record the information and attribute it to the correct author.</p>",
