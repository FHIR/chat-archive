We also do similar concepts for numeric stratification for provider outreach and other initiatives, as well as representing numeric risk scores that represent cost-adjustments based on a patient's overall risk (such as the Medicare HCC risk score or Verisk scores). I initially thought RiskAssessment would be the correct resource to use but I read some info suggestion Observation might be preferable. I think the data would fit better in Observation but was also curious how others are solving this problem so we don't do something too novel.</p>",
