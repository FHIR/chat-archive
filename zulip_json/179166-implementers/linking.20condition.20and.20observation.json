In the Observation you provide the answer: Yes my bladderfunction is abnormal. Suppose you wish to create a Condition instance for the compromised bladderfunction. You would link the BladderFunction-Observation Instance to the Condition through condition.evidence.detail (right?).</p>\n<p>But let's say the patient has an UroStoma because of this Condition. Would it be logical to link this to the Condition? We've captured Stoma in an observation profile.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extension-workflow-reasonreference.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extension-workflow-reasonreference.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extension-workflow-reasonreference.html</a> states</p>\n<p><code>Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this event.</code></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-definitions.html#Observation.focus\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-definitions.html#Observation.focus\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-definitions.html#Observation.focus</a> states</p>\n<p><code>The focus of an observation could also be an existing condition, an intervention, the subject's diet, another observation of the subject, or a body structure such as tumor or implanted device.</code></p>\n<p>In the UroStoma instance, should I use Observation.focus for the reference to the condition? Or the Observation.reasonReference extension?  Or should I link these resources differently?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>",

        "content": "<p>I was thinking about using Condition at first, but now I'm in serious doubt: The bladderfunction (care, not cure) information model has a valueset attached with three options:<br>\n1. incontinent<br>\n2. Sometimes a little accident (max once a day)<br>\n3. continent<br>\nNow if 1 or 2 is the case, i'd be more than happy to set this information in a Condition, but to me it doesn't make sense to profile this in Condition if there's no actual condition (option 3).. This is why my first instinct is to profile this in observation.. But if a client in the Care setting would do a GET  /Condition request, and the compromised bladderfunction wouldn't be returned I'd think that wouldn't be correct. Other way around, if the client would return \"continent\", that wouldn't be correct either.  I don't think Condition shouldn't be used for stating unaffected body functions, should it?</p>\n<p>Any ideas on how to tackle this?</p>",
