And the basic use was between the provider and the payer. In all cases when we talked about the 'claim' we defined the payer as an Insurance Company or Social Health Program (Medicaid in the US). </p>\n<p>We touched on the concept of one provider 'billing' (or charging or invoicing) another for for services performed for a service that the 'originating' provider then \"claimed\" from a payer.   i.e., Hospital A sends Patient A to Hospital B for a specific procedure - for whatever reason (Hospital A doesn't /didn't have the equipment, the equipment was not working). Hospital B then bills Hospital A for the services performed. Hospital A bills the 'insurance company' (Payer) for all services performed. We did not specifically create the use case and model it.  This was the use case we did not have any experience with. </p>\n<p>So, could there be a way to do it using the existing FM V2, V3 or FHIR messages, artifacts, resources? I'd make a SWAG that there probably is. Would it include all the necessary details, no clue. If this is an actual business need and we have interested parties in working through it, then I'd like to sit down and put together the use case and then take it from there. </p>\n<p>Thanks!!<br>\nMary Kay McDaniel</p>",
