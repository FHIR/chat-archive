This translates well into a MedicationRequest, and adapts appropriately for the \"suspend\" case (<code>set dose to zero for {y} min</code>).<br>\nThe case I'm stuck on is the \"cancel temp basal\" -- is the appropriate approach to set <code>doNotPerform</code> to true and then reference the original temp basal MedicationRequest with <code>priorPrescription</code>?<br>\nI am also wondering if MedicationStatement is the more appropriate resource to be using for both, but again it is not obvious how to represent \"cancel\"</p>",
