We’re looking to document several performers for an observation including the responsible observer (eg. the tech to generated the result) (Practitioner or PractitionerRole), the performing organization (Organization) and the medical director of the performing organization (Practitioner or PractitionerRole). These could all go in Observation.performer, but we think we need to specify the role each played. If we go with PractitionerRole for the responsible observation and medical director, we could use PractitionerRole.code to specify their role for the observation, but Organization doesn’t have a similar element. Is event-performerFunction the best way to go? Any other ways to do this?</p>",
