The emphasis is always on how to express them, and we usually end up with a way to say it. Have we considered the other side of the equation? Do we expect consuming applications to be able use these convoluted timings in some automated fashion? While it is great to be able to say things in this \"language,\" it needs to be understood on the other side.</p>",

We are currently looking at visualizing dosing information and a major challenge is just being able to cleanly identify and pick out the sort of instruction that can actually be  displayed in a UI that  is half-way readable. However, we work in in a multi-language setting, so free text is not great for us, either. Insofar as there are actually specific, more complex timing schemes that are commonly and broadly used, the easiest for us would arguable be to include them in the set of standard codes used for <code>Timing.code</code> (or have other large, but widely shared ValueSets for this element). The existing codes already overlap with timings that can be \"atomically\" expressed (using <code>period</code>, <code>frequency</code> etc.), there is even a nice table in <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#timing\">the Timing documentation</a> showing the correspondence.</p>",
