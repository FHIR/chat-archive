        "content": "<p>Hello,<br>\nI am trying to query the Organization by name , it works when the name is an exact match but it doesn't when I use apart of name. e.g. Organization?name=VASSAR fails but if I perform it as Organization?name=VASSAR HEALTH it gives a proper result. Is this normal? I tried this in HAPI but I also tried this on another server provided for pdex (prov directory) testing , the base URl for the  same is <a href=\"https://davinci-plan-net-ri.logicahealth.org/fhir/\">https://davinci-plan-net-ri.logicahealth.org/fhir/</a><br>\nTo address this I used _filter. I have a requirement that all my queries in provider directory -be it by name, specialty, address etc.  should be first filtered by _profile value as we want to ensure that we don't load resources generated from other transactions like CCD, ADTs, 837s etc. But when I use the _profile parameter in the query sing _filter, it says that '_profile' is not allowed or supported. Why _profile is not supported while using _filter? is there a different way of doing this, what should be the way forward.  I would be grateful if someone could shed light on this. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"215604\">@Saul Kravitz</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span></p>",
