Is there an expectation that this sort of connection between Coverage resource instances and InsurancePlan instances can be made?  If so, what attributes should be used to perform this 'join'/make this connection?</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/insuranceplan.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/insuranceplan.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/insuranceplan.html</a><br>\n[2] <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/insuranceplan-definitions.html#InsurancePlan.plan.identifier\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/insuranceplan-definitions.html#InsurancePlan.plan.identifier\">http://hl7.org/fhir/insuranceplan-definitions.html#InsurancePlan.plan.identifier</a></p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191403\">@Michelle (Moseman) Miller</span></p>",

I'll add this to the list of topics for the joint FM &amp; PA session in Atlanta on the morning of Sept 19. I expect we would discuss whether there is a logical linkage, e.g. based on Coverage.payor and Coverage.class (plan) to InsurancePlan. We could consider and extension for R4 and prior and whether that should be an extension or first order element in R5.</p>",
