I have some questions. <br>\n1. Where to plug the database (MS SQL Server) in Spark server?<br>\n2. Is there any Database schema for FHIR server to work?<br>\n3. Is the Spark server will create its tables in Database after getting the connection string to Database?

It is not trivial to change that to SQL Server, you would have to add that yourself. Please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/furore-fhir/spark/wiki/Architecture\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/furore-fhir/spark/wiki/Architecture\">Architecture</a>: you will have to implement a SQL counterpart to the Spark.Mongo layer.</p>\n<p>That being said we are working on a new version of Spark that will run on both MongoDB and SQL Server out of the box. The first release of it is scheduled for Q1 2017. Keep an eye on this thread, we will post an update if we released it. </p>",
