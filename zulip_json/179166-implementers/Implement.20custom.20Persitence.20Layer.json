I was able to set up a project to implement a RESTful Server (with simple in-memory hashmap to store Resources such as Patients). </p>\n<p>Additonally, I have launched the Spring Boot JPA Server Example which also works.</p>\n<p>My Question is if there is documentation or tutorial on how to create a JPA based Server which persists the data in a custom format. Since we do not want to use CLOBs but a robust relational schema, I am planing to generate the classes needed for this purpose based on the model classes provided e.g. within the \"org.hl7.fhir.dstu3.model\" package.</p>\n<p>Maybe  somehting similar has already been done and can be used?</p>",
