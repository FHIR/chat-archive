From before the Human Genome Project was conducted and GINA was passed.   And I’m not even going to get into intersex conditions and the lack of karyotype testing and infant intersex medical interventions. </p>\n<p>The more I look at these downloads though, I’m not seeing the value set expansions coded up in XML or JSON.  Just the schematrons.  Bummer.  Guess I’ll have to implement them by hand.  </p>\n<p>Also, I'm mostly criticizing what's listed in the ValueSet Expansions.  I'm aware the Resources themselves support multiple value sets.  I'm of the opinion that we need to implement a US-GINA Implementation Guide, with associated us-gina-* valuesets.</p>",
