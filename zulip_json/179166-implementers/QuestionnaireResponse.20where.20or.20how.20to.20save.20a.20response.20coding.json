An analysis/definition question: currently, in our external system, responses are registered and for this we use QuestionnaireResponse.<br>\nThen, on these answers, revisions and annexes are made. These annexes are not modifications of the answers, these are added and complement the initial answer (and are stored in tables of our system other than those of answers).</p>\n<p>We need, through FHIR, to be able to send to save this information related to a QuestionnaireResponse and then to also be able to retrieve it through GETs. Either retrieving the QResponse and returning the information within it or retrieving it individually and containing a reference to the QResponse.<br>\nWhat is recommended as a good practice to implement this type of situation in FHIR or where to save this information?</p>\n<p>I write the question in a generic way about saving info annexes about an answer (QResponse), in particular what we want to store is an encoding of that answer that is not known at first and then yes. And it is not registered by modifying the answer... is added elsewhere, associating the code with that answer. And then you should be able to query the before and after response (before uncoded, then coded).</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",

We are using a default initial value of \"n/a\"  for these questions when we create the questionnaire response.</p>\n<p>When the data becomes available later, our software app sends a PATCH  to modify the pertinent items in the questionnaire response from \"n/a\" to the actual data. </p>\n<p>This way, when we retrieve the updated questionnaire response via GET, it has all of the already existing data plus the new data.</p>",
