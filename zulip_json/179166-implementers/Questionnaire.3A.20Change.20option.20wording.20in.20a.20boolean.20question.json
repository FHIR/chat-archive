And this is especially the case in other languages (in my case, Finnish), where the form of the words \"yes\" and \"no\" often depends on how the question is asked. Is there some way to implement this in a type=boolean question, or would I have to make it a type=choice and define several ValueSets for the various kinds of yes/no questions?</p>",
