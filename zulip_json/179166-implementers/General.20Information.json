For a project I am working with the idea of opioid deaths as polysubstance (i.e. mixed with Chinese synthetics)  Currently the CDC has no implementation guidelines for this. If I am a healthcare vendor could I join HL7 and fill this gap - creating a new standard with FHIR? My second question is how do I make money as the vendor, through subscription to my data? Any help would be much appreciated for this neophyte.</p>",

So it'll take more than you, but one person/organization can certainly get the ball rolling.  In terms of making money, there are lots of business models.  It could be with an independent product.  It could be with an app or service that plugs into existing systems.  It could be from a knowledge data base.  It could be from services and/or training.</p>",
