I think i would prefer to use \"eligibility\" because it's a codeableConcept, and i could tie it to asking eligibility questions when people refer to the healthcareService. </p>\n<p>However, only being able to have one eligibility (codeableConcept) makes that idea impossible. So i'm just using eligibility note as a large text field instead.</p>\n<p>Thoughts? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191367\">@Brian Postlethwaite</span></p>",
