There is also a consideration to simply point to Procedure aks Specimen.collection --&gt; Procedure and capture all the nitty gritty detail there.  Of course the tradeoff is that Specimen alone won't be self-contained.  But I this is a good option to investigate.    for R4 stuck with an extension.</p>",
