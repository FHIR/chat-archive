But I think we've viewing at the problem from a different PoV. Let me try to cast it, I'm imagining a vendor (a startup in my case) that uses FHIR internally. I'm hoping that FHIR provides safe default. Then when billing / integration with 3rd parties (i.e. countries !!) a sort of bridge (i.e. terminology services) is created, per case. Long term strategy I'd think that is wise. This was my assumption about the goals of FHIR. Please correct me if I'm not getting it, because well... I want to be precise in my speech.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Let's use an example.  FHIR defines a MedicationRequest resource that can be used to represent drug prescriptions.  However, most countries in the world use different terminologies to identify medications, typically tied to the drug regulation process which is generally managed along national boundaries.  For example, the U.S. uses NDC codes and RXNorm, Canada uses DIN codes and CCDD.  The UK (I believe) uses SNOMED-CT.  So you're never going to get a U.S.-based system to fully support (decision support, costing decisions, claims submission, etc.) a prescription that comes from the UK.  Nor will a Canadian system full support one that comes from the U.S. </p>\n<p>However, we can still define very clearly where the \"drug code\" goes and what levels of granularity it will have.  We can also define a lot of other discrete data elements around it such as dose quantity, does units, route, etc.  And some of those coded elements are easier to impose expectations on (in part because the number of codes involved is more managable to translate).  We can also define places where human-readable \"string\" versions of the drug code can be conveyed so that even if the computer systems don't recognize the code, humans can at least see something useful.</p>\n<p>The reality is that most of the use-cases for interoperability don't involve data crossing borders, so the fact that the drug code systems are different doesn't impact a large percentage of care.  And from a software vendor perspective, having the same data structure in different countries that only differs by terminology choice makes it much easier to design a single solution that can be leveraged in multiple jurisdictions.  And if interoperability across national borders is deemed to be really important, then the parties involved can undertake the expense of developing and maintaining a mapping between the code systems.</p>\n<p>The reality is that our objective isn't to \"achieve interoperability\" because we'll only get absolute interoperability when all data goes through one system and is sent and received by users with the same business processes, thought processes and culture.  Our objective with FHIR (and other healthcare standards) is to <em>improve</em> interoperability.  We drive greater consistency where we can and try to make it easier for systems to do things in a way that makes it more likely for useful data to flow between systems.  It's a tremendous balancing act.  If we get too tight, then the implementer community won't use the standard because it's too hard, because it doesn't meet the regulatory requirements of their implementation spaces and/or because their users won't tolerate it.  If we make it too loose, then implementers just do whatever they've always done and call it \"standard\" and we get no improvement in interoperability.  And of course, the underlying regulations and practice of medicine continue to evolve underneath the process, making it still more entertaining... :)</p>",
