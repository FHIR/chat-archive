Reading the documentation, the process of creating a StructureDefinition seems quite straightforward (for simple cases at least), but I can't for the life of me find any mention of how to actually use the profiles once they are published on simplifier. We are doing a CDS system, should we just update our documentation to say, we are now using this and this profile, and start sending our own resources out to clients? Or is there some programmatic way to signify which profile we use in the actual resource? e.g. a resourceType of \"CustomQuestionnaire\" or whatever?</p>",

There's no requirement to do so - and no requirement for receivers to pay attention to the declaration, but it does allow receivers to get a sense of what they could validate the instance against if they wished.  The primary purpose of profiles is to support tighter validation.</p>",
