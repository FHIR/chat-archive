Some will be created just to solve some local or system specific business requirement, but many are really needed to support common requirements. A sign of this is of course all the official extensions. </p>\n<p>As a part of Swedish profiling, we see that we have the same requirement as our Dutch friends in stating that an address is \"official\" (<a href=\"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-address-official\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-address-official\">http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-address-official</a>). We are having a discussion on how to handle our common requirement, but we agree that a common/official extension would be good. </p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong><br>\nIs there a structured way of declaring the intent of an extension (e.g. Local/National/International, Local/Official etc)? This could make it easier to reuse extensions instead of creating new ones, as well as might help the creators of extensions to create them in a more generic way and add their local information in their profiles instead.</p>",
