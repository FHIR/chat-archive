In general, if the page size is N, then there shall be N 'focal resources of the search' in that page. It's a best practice to _(rev)include other resource types that reference the N 'focal' resources that are part of that same page.</p>\n<p>It would kind of defeat the entire purpose of pagination if one would add all includes to the final page.  Remember that search is stateless. </p>\n<p>This does beg the question of whether one could then have duplicates: some included resource X in page 1, and the same included resource X on page 2. AFAIK that's ok. </p>\n<p>Is it?</p>",
