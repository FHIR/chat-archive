Within that, we would like to be able to know, if a certain location was an ICU, or a 'regular ward' within a given period of time (namely the stay of a certain patient on that very ward). We do have that data within our clinical systems, but do not know, how to model it in FHIR.</p>\n<p>Is there already a way, to do this? ( We stumbled over the resource-history on the FHIR-server as well, but that seems not to be what we want, as it does only tell, when a change is made public to the server. )</p>\n<p>If not, something similar to the structure of Encounter.participant would be amazing in our opinion, since it contains exactly the type as well as the period for which that type is applicable.</p>\n<p>Christoph</p>",
