If not, how should the boundaries be determined?  The closest we got was:<br>\n** Instruction is intended to have the patient or family take some action, like self management or make a follow up appointment.<br>\n** Education is to inform the patient, like the risk of disease or the risk of side effects or adverse outcome of a medication or procedure, then it is education.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A lot of things are labeled as instructions, but have no similarities except that they are a communication with a patient or family member.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Communication.catrgory has an example \"instruction\" code, per <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/valueset-communication-category.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/valueset-communication-category.html\">http://build.fhir.org/valueset-communication-category.html</a>, but we never landed if the Communication.payload.content would be a string or another resource.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh, and Hospital Discharge Instructions is also an example Composition.section.code per <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/valueset-doc-section-codes.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/valueset-doc-section-codes.html\">http://build.fhir.org/valueset-doc-section-codes.html</a></p>",

While there may be orders for some medications, other medications on the list are over-the-counter and thus don’t merit an order, still others are already present in the home based on prior ambulatory prescriptions. The LOINC code specified in the value set 10183-2 is appropriate, but how is this concept managed in Medication Statement or Hospital Discharge Instructions. It seems that Hospital Discharge Instructions is a more appropriate - would that be handled as 8653-8 Hospital Discharge instructions (with specialized content as 10183-2), a Resource DocumentContent Type for an Encounter?</p>",
