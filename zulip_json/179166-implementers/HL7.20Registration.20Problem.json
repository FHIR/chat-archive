After filling out the registration form, I saw the message that a confirmation email was sent. After several hours no email was received so I verified our SPAM filters did not capture it. I made 2 more attempts to have the confirmation emails resent. Again they were not received nor did they appear in our SPAM filters. I then attempted to re-create my account in case I mis-spelled my email address but the registration attempt reported that my email address was already in use, so I canceled the attempt to re-create the account.</p>\n<p>How can I get this resolved?<br>\nThanks...</p>",
