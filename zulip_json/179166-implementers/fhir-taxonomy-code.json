In core and US core versions I didn't see any extensions available. Using the HAPI FHIR libraries I was able to add a custom extension. <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/WEa398J9QAMPUQm3cMdGA0i5/Screenshot-from-2021-04-05-162753.png\">Screenshot-from-2021-04-05-162753.png</a>. I did some research on the internet and was able to add the custom extension as seen in the screenshot. I apologize if this question has been asked before.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/WEa398J9QAMPUQm3cMdGA0i5/Screenshot-from-2021-04-05-162753.png\" title=\"Screenshot-from-2021-04-05-162753.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/WEa398J9QAMPUQm3cMdGA0i5/Screenshot-from-2021-04-05-162753.png\"></a></div>",
