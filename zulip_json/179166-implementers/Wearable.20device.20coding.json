I need to record a lot of fields as well like averageHeartRate, averagePace, averageSpeed, averageRunCadence, startingLong, starting Lat, etc. I know there's a lot of systems out there from <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/terminologies-systems.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/terminologies-systems.html</a> but I'm not sure what to use.</p>",
