Before I go and look at either off the shelf options or investigate creating a bespoke tool, does anyone use such a tool to create payload examples for profiles ?  I'd like to have a source of data that I can map to. I'm looking at Altova MapForce which seems to work very well, but seems excessive for this task. Are there any other options available ?<br>\nCheers</p>",
