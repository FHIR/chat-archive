This Bundle profile is used for validate a message Bundle who has 4 entries(MessageHeader, Parameters, Organization(sender),Organization(receiver)). At the moment i have a problem that all entries are validated for MessageHeader profile(the only one enforced on Bundle profile). I was recomended to use 'Invariants', but i don't know how to implement.</p>\n<p>Does anyone  can help?</p>\n<p>Thanks on advance.</p>",
