I want my app to automatically write the results in the patients EMR who has logged into the app. Does anyone know if there is a FHIR API that I can use to create lab results in a patients EMR? I have looked at Epic-supported FHIR APIs and they only have Observation.Read (Labs) and Observation.Search (Labs) but nothing to create an observation for labs in an EMR.  I'm pretty new to this so any help/guidance is really appreciated! Thanks</p>",

A transaction or messaging model might work.  But to answer your specific question, Epic does not have FHIR APIs to create lab results.  You'll need to use an HL7v2 ORU interface.</p>",

Patrick, I will look into this immediately, as I'm much more confident with java than HL7v2. I'm glad to hear you had success using this method. Thanks for the links - by \"endpoints\" do you mean specific epic servers that allow POST/PUT? Lastly, will the POST/PUT method show a message in the EMR, or would it be uploaded as a test results on the EMR?</p>",

Somebody has to do patient matching and validation,  encounter matching, order matching, DiagnosticReport  creation, observation creation/linking, and for lab tests that have multiple levels of components like micro, you end up with various structures of linked Observations for stuff like isolate/sensitivity or isolate/method/sensitivity.</p>\n<p>Most of the health systems we work with do not permit sending systems, even their hospital lab, to be the entity that is responsible for patient matching and validation.  Those processes are handled in the EHR that is receiving the results.  This is one of the main reasons why a REST API is unlikely to ever be a good option for submitting lab results to an EHR FHIR server:  it puts a lot of responsibility on the client for managing patient/encounter/order lookup and validation.  From a policy perspective, this is not desired by the folks in charge of the EHR at health systems.</p>\n<p>There may be a future where we have a FHIR <em>messaging</em> support for filing lab results.  But for now, our HL7v2 interface is very mature.  It has the technical capability to handle just about any sort of lab results you want to send, <em>and</em> we have well established operational processes to handle the patient/encounter/order matching challenges.</p>",
