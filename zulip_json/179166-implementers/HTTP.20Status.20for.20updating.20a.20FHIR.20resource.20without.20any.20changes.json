If no content in the updated FHIR resource has changed, would it be appropriate to return an HTTP 304 Not Modified response?</p>\n<p>Currently, FHIR specifies 200 Ok and 201 Created as the only valid responses, but if the server detects that there is nothing to update and no new version is generated, it seems reasonable to communicate that to the client.  Additionally, since no new version is generated, a version read would therefore not include an additional entry.</p>",
