Thanks, Bryn! Looking at the example below, specifically:<br>\n<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-recommendations/PlanDefinition-va-ckd-recommendations.html\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-recommendations/PlanDefinition-va-ckd-recommendations.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-recommendations/PlanDefinition-va-ckd-recommendations.html</a> </p>\n<p>For my purposes, the resource boils down to a patient population specific recommendation for a protein intake of 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg/day. Would it be appropriate to add an extension that slices or granularizes this portion of the resource by using a Substance or Medication to represent protein, a group to represent the patient population (CKD 3 or 4)  and a dosage to represent the range? I would also need a way to reference a patient for the weight basis. </p>\n<p>The current system uses objects like those described above to evaluate different recommendations that target the same factor (i.e. protein intake) a determines if any of them take precedence in the real-time context. Given that all the patient and prescription information is FHIR, it would be nice to not have to store the CDS rules in a separate database.</p>",
