(Or practically so--they've been at v3 for 20 years.) They do regular updates of the standard, but the updates are in a forward/backward compatible manner. If necessary, \"breaking changes\" are introduced in new SOP classes (closest equivalent is new resources), but most changes are the introduction of optional elements.</p>",
