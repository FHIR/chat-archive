It is an interesting use though, and I wonder if an extension to identify the post-processing step you want to apply would do the trick. The problem is it's a bit of shoehorning to fit that use case into the current reporting structure because you'd have to put an extension on the MeasureReport as well to report the outcomes. Might be worth mocking up?</p>",
