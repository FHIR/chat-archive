You can have an active Condition resource for the chronic disease, but it's also useful to document symptoms and duration when the disease flares up temporarily. That flare up might sometimes result in an Encounter or EpisodeOfCare, but not always. Would it be appropriate create a separate Condition resource for each acute flare up or is there a better approach?</p>",
