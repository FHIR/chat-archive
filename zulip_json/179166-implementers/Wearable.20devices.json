Some initial feedback:</p>\n<p>For <code>HKQuantityTypeIdentifierBloodGlucose</code> <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkquantitytypeidentifierbloodglucose?language=objc\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkquantitytypeidentifierbloodglucose?language=objc\">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkquantitytypeidentifierbloodglucose?language=objc</a> says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Blood glucose samples may be measured in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter) or mmol/L (millimoles per liter), depending on the region.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the code may also be 15074-8 Glucose [Moles/​volume] in Blood. You should check it entry by entry, I believe. The same thing with units may apply also to other things too...</p>\n<p>Do you have a reasoning for selecting the ultra sound version for HKQuantityTypeIdentifierWaistCircumference? I believe most entries in Apple Health would rather be 8280-0 Waist Circumference at umbilicus by Tape measure (there are more specific methods in LOINC too...). </p>\n<p>The vital signs profile <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-vitalsigns.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-vitalsigns.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation-vitalsigns.html</a> asks you to record blood pressure as a panel in FHIR, with components.</p>\n<p>Many of the nutrient intake LOINC codes you use are for 24h intake. I believe Apple Health stores those values as point-in-time entries (for instance, when a meal logging app stores an entry per meal), and then suggests you to calculate the 24 h cumulative values if required (<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkstatisticsquery?language=objc\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkstatisticsquery?language=objc\">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkstatisticsquery?language=objc</a>). I'd like there to be codes in LOINC for point-in-time entries for macro and micronutrients and am willing to work on that a bit if anyone else is interested.</p>\n<p>Still on the nutrient intake, you're using the Measured variants of the LOINC codes. My assumption is that a majority of entries in Apple Health would rather be Estimated. Any views on this?</p>\n<p>Finally, regarding the Dietary Sugar, the closest I can think of is 81050-7 Sucrose intake 24 hour Measured (or, again, the estimated version 81049-9 Sucrose intake 24 hour Estimated). Not sure whether HKQuantityTypeIdentifierDietarySugar would include lactose too...</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192917\">@Mikael Rinnetmäki</span>  Thanks for clarifying more about the use cases!</p>\n<p>Seems like there are two needs:<br>\n1. Name for observations/results provided by health apps/devices outside of hospital/traditional healthcare settings where similar data are collected in the EHR or LIS (lab information system).  Seems like a very similar data model to Point of Care Testing (POCT) where outside of lab devices create data from the analysis of patient specimens or devices used on the floor in patient care or patient observations (height, weight, temperature, etc.)</p>\n<p>2. LOINC codes for these items, especially those that are app/device generated (i.e. proprietary methods or calculations) to distinguish external devices/app generated data which is different/has a different \"trust\" level by health professionals than those that are generated in healthcare settings by healthcare professionals.  </p>\n<p>Have LOINC codes been requested from Regenstrief Institute for these emerging methods, devices, models?  If not, recommend they are requested to distinguish results/data generated.  It would also help folks to understand which results are comparable and which are not.</p>\n<p>Some additional questions:</p>\n<p>1. Are there other needs/reasons for using LOINC in the apps/devices?  <br>\n2. Is there a desire to integrate the data codified at it's point of origin in the device/app with EHRs or other information systems for patient reporting of Patient Generated Health Data (PGHD) or Social Determinants of Health (SDH)? </p>\n<p>If so, highly recommend the data is structured and codified at point of origin in the device or app and indicate (via LOINCs, SNOMED CT codes or other code systems depending on the type of data) so they can be shared, integrated in other software systems.  There has been much discussion with the American Hospital Association nd others on SDHPGHD uses, integration, etc.</p>\n<p>3. Are said devices/apps intended to be used clinically for monitoring health or only as \"entertainment\" (sharing self reported achievements more on social media)?</p>\n<p>If more clinical, recommend ensuring quality of data where possible, quality checks on data models,  etc. to ensure said data is clinically accurate, especially if it will be shared with providers.</p>\n<p>As an example,  I wear both a fitness device and my Apple Watch during workouts.  Both measure activity, exercise time, heart rate, etc.  However, each has their own proprietary method acquiring/originating these data.  How do I and my physician (if shared) know if the data are comparable or not?  If I'm just measuring how long I exercised, it's not as important clinically, other than I'm achieving minimum clinical guidelines each week/day.  However other data may have more of a trust level, especially those who have gotten FDA approval in the US (and similar approvals in other countries)</p>\n<p>4. Per the Apple comment, I'd be happy to chat with them on recommended Best Practices for use in the Health Kit of terminologies, code systems to help customers and developers achieve their needs.  (I've worked for a terminology vendor and CAP, who created SNOMED CT in the past, and am on the LOINC Committee and LOINC mapping expert.)</p>\n<p>5. If further clarification is needed with the FHIR resources for developers to guide to Best Practice implementations, feel free to share so they can updated, added into implementation guides, and the like.  </p>\n<p>Cheers,  Andrea</p>",

If we'd for instance want to have LOINC codes defined for point-in-time micronutrient intake (the use case being that I'm using a meal logging app and enter all the data from the nutrition information label on a pre-packaged meal, for instance). In essence, we'd likely map all the codes in 81941-7    Micronutrient intake panel to point in time measurements, instead of the 24h summary measurements that already have those codes. How would that process go, and would it be enough to just propose these to be added, with this kind of a justification and description of the use case, or should someone then drive the process more actively?</p>",

For instance in comparison to  Snomed CT, LOINC has a wider global reach across markets.<br>\n2. Yes, there is a desire to integrate data from apps and devices with EHR. Yes, it needs to be codified. That's one of the reasons why FHIR is interesting for app vendors.<br>\n3. Both do exist. The more clinically relevant are more interested in FHIR, LOINC, and Snomed CT at the moment. Quality checks have been discussed in some communities I've been involved in, but I feel that's a bit separate topic. The consensus that I've seen so far is that he healthcare professionals should understand the quality of the data in general (9851 steps taken does not necessarily mean exactly 9851 physical steps performed by the individual wearing the device), and I believe for the most part they already do. Anyway, this has more to do with how that data is actually used in healthcare setting.<br>\n4. I can't speak for Apple, but as you can read from this thread, some people in the community would see value in having the data in Apple Health having LOINC codes.</p>",

The LOINC names are not designed for GUIs either, except for display names depending on the use case.  I wouldn't use \"what's available\" just because it's available unless it meets use case needs.  Further, use of the LOINC name for GUIs isn't how it was intended to be used according to the User Guide.  I'll also say for some clinical terms, the LOINC descriptions may be simple, short, clear and be used for some data items.  It's variable.</p>",
