Cmd line execution of the jar gives the expected OperationalOutcome.<br>\nWhen called from within a SpringBoot application is when the error is returned.<br>\nSpringBoot application has a local version of the igpack that is added to the validationEngine = new ValidationEngine(idPackPath);<br>\nOther validations have been successful using the SpringBoot application.<br>\n<strong>Error: </strong><br>\n<code>java.lang.Error: Not done yet - resolve Practitioner/cc-prac-carlson-john locally</code><br>\n<strong>Trouble shooting steps: </strong> <br>\nGrabbed the latest validation jar from <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/downloads.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://build.fhir.org/downloads.html\">https://build.fhir.org/downloads.html</a>  with the same error result.   (3.4.0 to 3.6.0)<br>\nAdded the Practicitioner resource to the bundle with the same error.<br>\nRemoved the line <code>\"reference\": \"Practitioner/cc-prac-carlson-john\",  </code> <strong>resulting in a good Operation Outcome response.</strong>  <br>\nLooked into the validation jar readme and do not see a way to turn off any potential referential integrity checks that may be happening.<br>\n<strong>Questions: </strong><br>\nI did grab the latest validation jar but still have a previously downloaded igpack embedded into the SpringBoot app.  Is there is a relationship between the validation jar and the igpack, if so where can I download the latest igpack?<br>\nAny idea on what is special about the requester.agent.resource?<br>\nThanks in advance,<br>\nJoyce<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/7F-zoD7L5gm7RXsHgDsaIeSN/validate_MedBundleBetsy.bat\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"validate_MedBundleBetsy.bat\">validate_MedBundleBetsy.bat</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/8QC24DLpaKXQg6SACTUEIpg9/MedBundleBetsy.json\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"MedBundleBetsy.json\">MedBundleBetsy.json</a> FHIR Validation jar - MedicationRequest</p>",
