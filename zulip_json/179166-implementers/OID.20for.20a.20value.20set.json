If you do need an OID and don't have another obvious way to obtain one within your particular context, then I would suggest considering registering it in the HL7 OID Registry: <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/oid/index.cfm?ref=common\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hl7.org/oid/index.cfm?ref=common\">http://www.hl7.org/oid/index.cfm?ref=common</a></p>",
