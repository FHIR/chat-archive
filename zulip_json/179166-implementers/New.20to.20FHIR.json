The standard makes sense to me, but I came to this chat today to ask you for some pointers. Specifically, where can I see examples - preferably videos - of actual FHIR implementations? There is a lot of great content on YouTube about the history and building blocks, but I'm looking at it from the perspective of  - using Mirth Connect (free) and an IP address, I could setup a lab order/result integration using ORM and ORU messages in a few minutes.  I'm struggling to \"see the whole picture\" with FHIRs, so....succinctly:  any good resources of videos to see FHIR in action so that I might get a better idea?  I feel like I'm so close, so it's especially frustrating. I see all the pieces and how they are supposed to work.    Thank you</p>",

In terms of presentations, or videos, demos, etc. does anything come to mind that might help me?

The above article contains very useful info and presentation video.<br>\nAfter seeing the video, i have few more queries<br>\nDo we required to pre-populate the slot for the appointment?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If yes, then how can we divide the slots with time period because if we divide with the fix 30 mins period then how can use the 30 mins slot for the 10/15 mins appointment?</li>\n<li>if yes, then Upto how many days or months do we required to pre-populate the slots, because we need to provide the future appointments also.</li>\n<li>If no, then when will we required to create the slots for schedule at which time period?</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<p>Anybody care to take a stab at helping me understand a particular knowledge gap I have regarding FHIR?  I look at the spec - all the info on the website, the resources, the security guidelines, etc.  Ok, I equate most of that to HL7 v2 specs.   What I don't understand is WHERE/HOW you actually use FHIR. For example, if you want to create a patient using v2, you could send an ADT^A04 using an interface engine like Mirth/NextGen Connect, Corepoint, Epic Bridges, etc.      I am really struggling to understand the equivalent in FHIR.  <br>\nHere is a link to what the json for an example of the Patient resource would look like. This is the best example of a comparison I could find.<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient-example.json.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient-example.json.html</a><br>\nSo, ok I can equate this json with the body of the v2 message.</p>\n<p>Here's where I get stuck - how do I send this json?  I think my lack of knowledge around FHIR is mostly related to the software/tools used \"WITH\" FHIR.   I've learned that people use a variety of different languages to code their API calls, but what tool/application, etc. is used to actually send the call?</p>\n<p>It would be super (exponentially) helpful to me if somebody could give me some pointers,  throw out some concepts for me to google, refer me to an expert. Anything that could help me close this gap. I'm willing to put in the time and effort and want to learn this so badly, but I feel stuck on fundamental issues.     For context, I have over a decade of experience with v2. I could jump from job to job or between applications with a very little time spent in a learning curve.    I know FHIR is celebrating its 10th birthday, but it seems like it went from \"this is on our roadmap\" to seeing FHIR as a requirement in job descriptions and I feel like I missed something.   Forgive me for the long message, but I hope this might be the right venue to at least get the attention of somebody who could offer some help.  Thank you.</p>",

So FHIR is just using the protocol of the web to transfer data between systems. </p>\n<p>To further close the gap, I suggest you try it. You can take the JSON text of Patient resource you have and POST it to an open FHIR server. There are a zillion ways to do this, but to do it manually the free tool POSTman is commonly used. For instance you could HTTP POST your patient to the open HAPI server at this URL:  <a href=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient\">http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient</a><br>\nThen you can use an HTTP GET operation to retrieve the resource you posted. The URL you would HTTP GET will be determined by the ID the FHIR server assigns to it, but will be of the form: <a href=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient/{id}\">http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient/{id}</a>. The response of your POST operation will tell you the id that was assigned and the full URL to use to fetch it.</p>",

Still other times, you could use messaging just like you do in v2 or perhaps even a custom operation.  Those latter two will be much less interoperable and will have higher overhead, but there are situations when they'll be necessary/appropriate.
