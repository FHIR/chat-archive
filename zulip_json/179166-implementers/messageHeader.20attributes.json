(In part because most FHIR implementation doesn't make use of messaging at all.)  The MessageHeader.focus points to the resource the message event is 'about'.  For example, if you were sending a \"patient admission\" message, the focus would be Encounter - which is the resource that was undergoing a state transition as part of the 'admission' business event.  Everything else in the message would have some sort of relationship path to the Encounter.  In some cases, a message might have multiple focus resources.  For example, a \"merge patient\" message would have two (or maybe more) focal resources - one for each Patient resource to be merged.</p>",
