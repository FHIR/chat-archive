It has some limitations which we called out in the presentation you linked.  If there is interest in supporting another data type for time series data from devices I would love to start that discussion :)</p>\n<p>But for now we are limited to SampledData or defining your own extension to store the data.  I think one challenge you will have with devices there really isn't a start/end for the observation.  For the IoMT FHIR connector we handle this by bucketing data according to time (most commonly in one hour bounded chunks) and render the data we receive with in those hour boundaries according to the SampledData type.</p>",
