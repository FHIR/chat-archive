(That's more for things like the height and weight used to calculate dose or the current blood pressure value if dosage was conditional on that, etc.)  Given that in pharmacy, a dispense includes a more refined order, I can see that being tracked in some cases.  As I look at the model, there's also no mechanism to point to a service request or care plan as the driver for the administration either.  Sounds like something to submit a change request for.  At minimum, it would make sense for there to be a standard extension for this.</p>",
