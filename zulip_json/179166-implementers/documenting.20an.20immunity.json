The immunity might be documented because the patient was diagnosed with a disease (a child had chickenpox so should now be immunity to varicella virus) or it may be inferred from the results of a lab test (serological test for anti-varicella IgG). Would immunity just be inferred from a Condition or Observation (for the two examples respectively) or is there a harmonized way to  indicate immunity (maybe an Observation where .derivedFrom points back to the lab test Observation) regardless of how immunity was determined?</p>",
