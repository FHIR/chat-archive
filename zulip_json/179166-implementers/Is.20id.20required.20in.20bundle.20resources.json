However, if we validate a standalone resource without id, it works. I suspect that this is because id should not be used in a create so validator let it pass. The bundle page doesn't mention anything about id. What I don't understand is \"what if I use bundle to create multiple resources without ids, would validator fail it too?\" Can somemone shed some light on this?</p>",
