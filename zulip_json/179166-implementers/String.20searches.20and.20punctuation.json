My reading is that right now it's not, but it's reasonable from them to want to do so.  On the other hand, ignoring punctuation always could be problematic.  Do we want to add an allowance for ignoring punctuation at server discretion?</p>",

So, I'll formulate a resolution,  add it to the list of \"ready for vote\" items, and then we can race through that list.  That's probably 40 in total, so if we want to do all of them, we'd have to stick to 3 minutes on average ;-)</p>",
