But this is not actionable in our context; the entire vial of ampicillin gets mixed with 1.3ml sterile water to achieve a concentration of 250 mg/1.5 ml.  The actionable/mixed dosage is the amount of this mixture that should be administered, 0.9ml in this case.  How could these two kinds of dosages be represented with FHIR Resources?  Thank you!</p>",

The 150mg is the actual dose that is administered.  This would be captured as part of the dosage instructions - either in the dispense or the administration.</p>",
