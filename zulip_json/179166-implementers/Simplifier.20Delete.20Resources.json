For now deleting one-by-one is the only option, though if it is a very big set please send an email to <a href=\"mailto:simplifier@fire.ly\" title=\"mailto:simplifier@fire.ly\">simplifier@fire.ly</a> with the details of the project, what you need deleted from it and we can do it behind the scenes instead.</p>\n<p>Can you share how you ended up with this large set of resources you need deleted?<br>\nAlso, here's a first look at how we are currently implementing the feature: <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/tvZ8kDafc3dNAXdUY1rKDsh7/BulkDelete.mp4\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"BulkDelete.mp4\">BulkDelete.mp4</a>. Your feedback would be welcome. We're implementing a more file-focused view to manage the files, the current Resources tab is more FHIR-resources and search oriented. You will be able to select-all, select one-by-one or shift-click to select a range of files.</p>",
