We were looking at AdverseEvent and it has an element that references the DocumentReference resource.  He asked if it should be US Core Profile of DocumentReference since that is not profiled in QI Core.  To me it seems logical that it should be but I couldn't point to anything in the IG that says that or would constrain that.  Thoughts?</p>",
