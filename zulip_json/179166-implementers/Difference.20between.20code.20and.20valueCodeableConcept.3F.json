So you might have a code that says \"skin color\" and a valueCodeableConcept that says \"grayish-blue\".  You can also have Observation.code present with something like \"systolic blood pressure\" and instead of valueCodeableConcept, you'd have valueQuantity.  Think of Observation as a name-value pair.  The code is the name and the value is the value.  Sometimes the value happens to be a code.</p>",
