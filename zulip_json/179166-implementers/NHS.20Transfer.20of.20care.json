We don't have a timeline for when \"all\" of FHIR will go normative as we still expect brand new content to be introduced in future releases and it takes at least 3 years for new content to migrate to normative after that.</p>\n<p>You might also look at the <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/versions.html#maturity\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/versions.html#maturity\">FHIR maturity model</a> to help evaluate the portions of FHIR that are most relevant to your organization.</p>",
