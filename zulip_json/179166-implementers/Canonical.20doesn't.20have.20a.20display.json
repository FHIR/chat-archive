This complicates by ability to show off the resulting structure because it won't have a display field like a reference does. Is there a suggested workaround for this? I suppose when actually rendering this thing you could call the canonical and get the activity description, is that the intended way to display what the activity is?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>just realized the PlanDef.action has the text equivalent, making the display redundant, and so my second question is covered. I would still like to read about canonical vs reference however</li>\n</ul>",
