Where could I store this information? I found ObservationDefinition, but this seems like it is meant to be used as a golden standard like StructureDefinition, and there is no way for this resource to refer to a patient, practitioner, or organization. Also, it is very immature. I am considering using the Observation resource with the .referenceRange field populated and the .value field blank, because it can hold all the references I need. I'm afraid this is misusing this resource, though.</p>",
