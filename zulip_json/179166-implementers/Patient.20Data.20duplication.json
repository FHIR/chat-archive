Patient A registers at the hospital, gets sent to the lab and has a Covid Test at the airport. If all three system are connected to the same FHIR datasource, I should be able to pull a single view of the patient? Is my assumption correct? If I am unable to do this, its the FHIR implementation done wrong?</p>",

But you don't have to. \"Connected\" may mean they can all share data, or synchronize, but each has its own local copy also. FHIR is a technology that allows you to access data, and move it around and share it. It does not tell you which copy is the main or only one or who may have other copies. There are lots of data architectures possible. There is no \"wrong\" in that respect.</p>",
