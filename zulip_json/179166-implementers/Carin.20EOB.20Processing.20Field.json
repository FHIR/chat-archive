The equations are:</p>\n<p>(1) Eligible amount = submitted amount - the noncovered amount – discount</p>\n<p>(2) member liability = deductible + coinsurance + copay + noncovered</p>\n<p>(3) payment amount = eligible amount - the member liability</p>\n<p>For us equations (1) and (3) are particularly problematic.</p>\n<p>Question: Is it okay for our claims to violate these 2 equations in FHIR? Our client's claims processing system does not work the way FHIR expects and they would like to largely disregard these 2 equations. Will that be a problem?</p>",
