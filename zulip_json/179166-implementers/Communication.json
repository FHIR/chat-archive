The question however is how do we indicate the first language or proficiency or ability  in a language ? For example - if we have to represent that a patient has difficulty reading or writing English .</p>",

But I can understand that it again falls into 20% cases. So what is the best way to represent questions like - Do you have difficulty understanding English? or Do you have any difficulties reading / writing English? I am asking because from the answers above it is not clear if this warrants an extension . </p>",
