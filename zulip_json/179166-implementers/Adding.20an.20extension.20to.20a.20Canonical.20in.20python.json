It is not possible to simply call the extension as I can with a domain resource. That is, I would want to do something like :<br>\nquestionnaire_response = QuestionnaireResponse()<br>\nquestionnaire_response.questionnaire.extension = [<br>\n                        {<br>\n                            \"url\": \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/display\">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/display</a>\",<br>\n                            \"valueString\": \"KOLS skjema\"<br>\n                        }<br>\n                    ]</p>\n<p>But this is not possible as questionnaire (a Canonical) does not accept extension.<br>\nI'm using the fhirclient library.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have some tips, or can point me to a better place to get help?<br>\nBest,<br>\nKristine</p>",
