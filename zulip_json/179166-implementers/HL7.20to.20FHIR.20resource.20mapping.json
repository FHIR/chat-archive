I was looking to map PV17 &amp; PV117 to an appropriate FHIR resource property. Currently, I'm treating both as '<a href=\"http://EpisodeOfCare.careManager.Practitioner.name\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://EpisodeOfCare.careManager.Practitioner.name\">EpisodeOfCare.careManager.Practitioner.name</a>'. I would like these two components to be referenced by two different FHIR resource properties. Any suggestions?</p>",
