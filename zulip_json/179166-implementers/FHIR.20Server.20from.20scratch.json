We would like to make this data available in FHIR format. This data warehouse is a relational data store that is currently queryable via standard SQL queries. A use case for us would be to pull out a JSON file of all lab results between specific dates for a specific patient in FHIR format.</p>",

But I think you are looking for an all purpose test-server that would implement as much of the FHIR spec as possible.  There are many in the list you mentioned, but you have to make sure you picked one with the right version of the FHIR specification.  You picked \"spark\", which is fine, but it only supports DSTU2, a somewhat older version of FHIR.  The latest version of FHIR is STU3, and I expect <a href=\"http://clinfhir.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://clinfhir.com\">clinfhir.com</a> is using that version.</p>\n<p>So, in order to work with the test servers, you should probably make sure that all components use the same version<br>\n1) Does the server support STU3?<br>\n2) Am I using the STU3 version of the .NET library?<br>\n3) Is <a href=\"http://clinfhir.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://clinfhir.com\">clinfhir.com</a> using STU3 (or can you switch versions?) <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191321\">@David Hay</span>  would know about that.</p>\n<p>Here is a bit more information about the different versions of FHIR: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/directory.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/directory.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/directory.html</a></p>",
