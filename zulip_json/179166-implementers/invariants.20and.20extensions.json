Can you define an invariant on an extension element that says that you may have either that extension element, or a particular core element, but not both simultaneously?  Or, could the invariant be defined on the core element, but still reference the extension element (whether or not that extension is present)?  Or is there a different way to do this?  I'm assuming that there's likely some way that it can be done, but I would like to verify what would be the best approach.</p>",
