(Class means the level of the hospital. For example, class 1, class 2â€¦. They are defined by government)</p>\n<p>Background: If a patient wants to get benefits from insurance, they have to go to the registered hospital first. After the patient is referred to another clinic by the hospital, he has to bring his insurance card and reference letter. This only way they can get benefits from insurance in this country.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>",
