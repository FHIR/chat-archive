This would give us a way to display the id/code and display value for the appointment type from the source system. In the past, we have used an extension with a valueString, which was set to the ID/code. Our customer would also like to have the actual display value included. We were looking at using valueCode as an option to show both the ID and Display fro certain fields.  Any guidance?
