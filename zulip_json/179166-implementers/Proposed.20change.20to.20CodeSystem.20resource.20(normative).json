This was always the intent, but we haven't been enforcing it and therefore some of the existing instances in the spec (and likely elsewhere) haven't populated it when they should.  If you have implemented CodeSystem (or have an opinion about it), we would appreciate it if you would provide your thoughts on the proposed change <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179202-terminology/topic/HL7.20Presentation.20-.20Questions\" title=\"#narrow/stream/179202-terminology/topic/HL7.20Presentation.20-.20Questions\">here</a> or in the tracker.  Thanks!</p>",
