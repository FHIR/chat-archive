But be aware that each of the filters are independent.  So you might get back a Practitioner that has one role that references ORG_A and a different role that references SERVICE_B.  If you want them to both hold together, then you'll need to do your search on PractitionerRole and then do an _include to bring back the corresponding Practitioner for each satisfying PractitionerRole</p>",
