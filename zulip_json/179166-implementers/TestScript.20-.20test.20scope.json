The purpose of TestScript <strong>is</strong> to test the implemented systems and profiles.</p>\n<p>TestScript is \"A structured set of tests against a FHIR server or client implementation to determine compliance against the FHIR specification.\" see <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/testscript.html#7.3\">http://hl7.org/fhir/testscript.html#7.3</a></p>\n<p>TestScript(s) are executed by a FHIR Test Engine as defined by the FHIR spec. see <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/testing.html#execution\">http://hl7.org/fhir/testing.html#execution</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TestScript.metadata</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Agreed. The name is can be confused with Resource.meta and needs to be re-examined as to its usefulness.</p>\n<p>The reality is that, based on our experience with authoring and executing TestScripts against many different testing scenarios, the TestScript.metadata is something we just don't use. We have found that the rest of the TestScript elements provide this information; fixtures (test data), profiles (StructureDefinitions from the base spec to IGs), operations (FHIR interactions that also define the Resource Types) and so on. We parse all of this information within the TestScript to provide appropriate mappings to and recording of this information against the test execution results. This information is then collected, collated and made available for analytics and reporting back to the user.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I've created a ticket to check whether this is correct - that the TestScript.profile is \"the thing that this TestScript intends to cover\". The description could be improved and the name is misleading.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on the previous point and my response, I would have to say the the TestScript.profile does indicate what the TestScript intends to cover in so much as FHIR profiles are concerned.</p>\n<p>The TestScript.profile element, as Ryan has described, <em>is used to declare an Id Alias for assert.validateProfileId</em>. This profile id then refers to the canonical url (identifier) of the FHIR Profile so that it can be used in an assert that calls the FHIR validation engine to evaluate/validate the resource payload of an operation request or response against that FHIR Profile.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>what I'm lookin for is the system under test or capability under test</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our implementation of the FHIR Test Engine provides an interface for pre-test setup where the destination or target System Under Test (FHIR Server) is selected. The FHIR Test Engine in this case then acts as the client constructing and sending the defined FHIR operation(s) in the TestScript(s). This follows the FHIR spec for testing as defined under the \"Operation Execution\" - see <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/testing.html#op\">http://hl7.org/fhir/testing.html#op</a>.</p>\n<p>A TestScript can also explicitly define what actors, FHIR Client(s) and Server(s), are needed through the declaration of the TestScript.origin and TestScript.destination elements. When present, the FHIR Test Engine then needs to accept as input the actual System(s) Under Test that match these declarations.</p>\n<p>Our testing platform provides our users the ability to register their systems, FHIR Client(s) and Server(s). These registered systems are then made available for selection against the declared TestScript actors. This also provides us with the ability to get and cache a system's CapabilityStatement. We then use the system's CapabilityStatement in our test result reporting where we can let the user filter their results to either include all results or exclude results that do not correspond to the system's declared capabilities.</p>",
