        "content": "<p>Sure, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> - DICOM Modality Worklist (MWL) is the communication to the modality of patient/order demographic information. For example, \"patients for CT Room 1\", \"patients for Ultrasound\", \"today's patients to be scanned\". The X-Ray Technician, standing at the actual modality (i.e., a touchscreen monitor hardwired to the X-Ray machine), selects the patient from this list to be immediately scanned. Then - the machine scans the patient, and creates DICOM combining the acquired images and the selected demographic information, which is transmitted to the PACS. This way, we prevent the \"manual typing errors\" that occur when MWL is unavailable (and someone has to type the patient ID, patient Name, etc at the modality).</p>\n<p>The compelling discussion that we had at FHIR DevDays - while it will be a long long time before we see updated modalities in hospitals that do DICOMweb/FHIR (modalities stay in the hospital for quite some time, and are infrequently replaced / firmware updated) - it doesn't seem to be that far of a stretch to create a FHIR MWL Proxy - that could receive MWL queries (classic DICOM) from modalities, make FHIR DiagnosticRequest or ProcedureRequest queries, and then transform that back into a MWL response to return back to the modality. As part of STU3, we submitted a couple of important changes to the search criteria in ProcedureRequest to support and enable this workflow possibility.</p>",

For sure the \"big\" modalities which stay in the hospital  will stick to DICOM for quite a while ( as they integrate with RIS on a DICOM base), but some smaller ones like ultrasound or cardiographic may be interested to query using FHIR in future times.</p>\n<p>We just built a small worklist provider for modalities not beeing connected to a RIS , and I'm thinking of scheduling extensions towards proxy capabilities here.</p>",
