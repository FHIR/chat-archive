This means that all those links in our Resources are dead, making it problematic for Resource consumers to determine the meanings of the codes used.</p>\n<p>My question is, would it be possible to set up forwarding from the old uri to the new one so that the links in our resources continue to work?</p>",

E.g., the working version of that code system I link above (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationType/cs.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationType/cs.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationType/cs.html</a>) does not have an stu version in the  url. Does that imply that it could also be phased out at some point?</p>",

It doesn't currently redirect, but as I mentioned in my note to Grahame above, we should probably set it up as one.  In terms of how long we'll maintain that, I can't say - probably until DSTU2 and STU3 are no longer in significant use - which is probably at least 10 years from now.</p>\n<p>The way to tell whether things are locked in stone is to look at their ballot status.  If the status is \"normative\", that means you can count on it remaining the same.  Anything else is potentially subject to going away/changing.</p>",
