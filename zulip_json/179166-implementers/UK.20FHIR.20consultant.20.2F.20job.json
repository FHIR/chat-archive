We're currently investigating and scoping a Health Dashboard / booking system that we'd like to meet the FHIR specification. It's early days and I am currently pulling in the necessary resources to build a team to implement the application.</p>\n<p>I have become familiar with some of the FHIR specification and have Firely server running locally, but I am quickly realising that having someone to consult with / discuss architecture options with would be hugely beneficial. This may well be a full time role / long term contract basis.</p>\n<p>If this is of interest to anyone here, or if there is somewhere in particular that I should post this then let me know!</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",
