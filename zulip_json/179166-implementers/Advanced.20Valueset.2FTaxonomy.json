For the taxonomy, i want to make it hierarchical and have more fields than are typically published in valuesets (i.e., in addition to code/display/description, i want fields like facet, aliases, see also, tags etc...). </p>\n<p>It's still ultimately a valueset as only the code(s) will be applied to the healthcareService.type field. Does it matter that my valueset has more data in it than a standard valueset? Is there a preferred way to publish that kind of valueset? Also, are there specific ways to deal with hierarchical taxonomies?</p>",
