I think what it means is that this looks for Patients which have an \"active\" field that is not set to true, so it still misses the ones without \"active\".</p>",

What this means then is that if I want a list of only the active patients, I need to just keep paging through batches of Patients, discarding the inactive ones.  It could be quite inefficient, if there are lots of inactive ones.</p>",
