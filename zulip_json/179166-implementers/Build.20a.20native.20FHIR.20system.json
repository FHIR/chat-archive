I have been a developer for almost 10 years and were able to develop a web application from scratch but health care industry is new to me specially this fhir specification. Based on my understanding, fhir is just a tool to follow the standards in EHR (I had read this one - <a href=\"https://www.health-samurai.io/articles/the-fhir-guide-for-ctos-and-technical-leaders\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.health-samurai.io/articles/the-fhir-guide-for-ctos-and-technical-leaders\">https://www.health-samurai.io/articles/the-fhir-guide-for-ctos-and-technical-leaders</a>).  My new project is to develop a system that supports fhir. I've been careful for the steps to do hence I wanted to somehow understand the bigger picture first on how this fhir works or if im going to implement it, at least its following the industry standard. </p>\n<p>My first question is what is the database design if you're going to implement CMS web application and you add the fhir database to it. Am I need to create a users table or fhir already have this table?</p>\n<p>Also,  I really wanted to see what fhir database looks like or an ERD of it, so that I can somehow understand the tables. I hoping for your inputs. Thank you!!!</p>",
