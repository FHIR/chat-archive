I note that the datatype for Organization.contact.telecom is <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#ContactPoint\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#ContactPoint</a> which has a required valueset for its use element containing   home | work | temp | old | mobile - purpose of this contact point. Would the only way to represent an emergency contact number be to extend this datatype or could any implementers suggest another way of doing this? Many thanks in advance.</p>",
