Given that the data type <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#ContactPoint\">ContactPoint</a> is normative and the value set <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-contact-point-use.html\">contact-point-use</a> is normative and required, I'm assuming an extension for \"After hours contact\" is a viable option?  Any other suggestions or feedback?  Cheers</p>",

The contact could be listed in order of priority by using the data element HealthcareService.telecom.rank.  I'll need to check with the use case/product owner (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"193980\">@Kieron McGuire</span> ), if providing the contact numbers at specific time ranges is sufficient to indicate \"after hours\" or \"regular hours\"?</p>",
