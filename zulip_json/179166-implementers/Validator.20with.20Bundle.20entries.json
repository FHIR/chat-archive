Every entry in your message must be reachable by traversing from the MessageHeader, though it doesn't have to be a direct connection.  For example, if MessageHeader points to DiagnosticReport, DiagnosticReport points to Patient and Patient points to Organization, then you'd have met the requirement for all 3 resources.  Reverse connections are also ok.  So if a Provenance points to the DiagnosticReport, that still counts.  Something sitting all by itself that isn't reachable when you traverse all the relationships is an error</p>",
