        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191619\">@Peter Bernhardt</span> Yes, the expectation is that MedicationOrder will be renamed to MedicationRequest.  The reason is to make the scope clearer and also to be consistent with other resources - MedicationOrder is also used for plans, recommendations and proposals.  So naming it \"Order\" is misleading.  Look at the Workflow patterns in the ballot to get a sense of the changes that are proposed.  (There may be some renaming of elements for alignment too, though \"prescriber\" is unlikely to change as there's strong reasons for it to be distinct.)  If you have strong feelings about any actual or proposed changes, feel free to comment in the ballot.</p>",
