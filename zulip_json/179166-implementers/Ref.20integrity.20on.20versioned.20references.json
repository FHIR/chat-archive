We check the existence of the target version when the reference is created/updated. It could be the current version, or a history version - works the same way. If it's the current version, you can later update/delete that target resource and the reference will point into the history.</p>\n<p>We don't block deletion of the target version through $purge on the grounds that anyone using $purge probably has good reasons to make the data go away, but unless that happens the reference will always remain valid.</p>",
