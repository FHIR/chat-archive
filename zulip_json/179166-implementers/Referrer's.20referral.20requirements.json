So if Organization A referrs to Oragnization B, then B says \"yes that's OK if you send me this information to enable the referral\". The type of information required will vary depending on where the patient is being referred to. We are intending to specify the information that is required for a referral on a CapabilityStatement (type=requirements) and using the CapabilityStatement to list the profiles that are required for the referral.<br>\nHas anyone done anything similar? Does this sound like a good idea?</p>",

CapabilityStatement is about defining what behavior a system must have the capability to support, not to request specific information.  </li>\n<li>I would not recommend describing what information that you want as profiles.  Most systems aren't able to retrieve information by profile.  Also, profiles don't necessarily allow filtering of the subset of information that you want back. </li>\n<li>Usually, requests for information should expressed as queries - that allows you to specify the desired resource and any filters on it - and aligns with how systems typically know how to find information.  By default, you'll get back the intersection of what the system is capable of returning and what you have permission to see.  You have no hope of getting more than that, regardless of what profile you want, nor do you have a hope of getting systems to organize the data in the way you might like it to be.  The most you can do is enumerate the specific elements you want (using _elements) and having the sender filter out everything else.</li>\n<li>If you have the ability to query directly, just do that.  If you don't, I'd encourage you to look at the <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-ecdx/specification.html#task-based-approach\">CDex Task-based</a> mechanism for soliciting additional information.  Your 'request for information' would have a 'partOf' relationship to the original 'please fulfill' Task for the referral (establishing context) and would specify the query you want executed.  The placing system could then return the desired information as an output of the Task.</li>\n</ul>",
