I am using the query as follows:<br>\n<a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:12443/fhir-server/R4/Observation?_has:DiagnosticReport:result:_id=440\">http://127.0.0.1:12443/fhir-server/R4/Observation?_has:DiagnosticReport:result:_id=440</a></p>\n<p>When I run the query shown above it returns no result although it doesn't throw any error either.  The result that I am receiving is shown below:<br>\n{<br>\n    \"resourceType\": \"Bundle\",<br>\n    \"id\": \"1ac447de-c9ee-4433-9d59-169d2d0ca579\",<br>\n    \"meta\": {<br>\n        \"lastUpdated\": \"2021-02-08T18:30:13.871-08:00\"<br>\n    },<br>\n    \"type\": \"searchset\",<br>\n    \"total\": 0,<br>\n    \"link\": [<br>\n        {<br>\n            \"relation\": \"self\",<br>\n            \"url\": \"<a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:12443/fhir-server/R4/Observation?_has%3ADiagnosticReport%3Aresult%3A_id=440\">http://127.0.0.1:12443/fhir-server/R4/Observation?_has%3ADiagnosticReport%3Aresult%3A_id=440</a>\"<br>\n        }<br>\n    ]<br>\n}<br>\nI know that the Observation/440 is referenced by a DiagnosticReport in the 'result' element as I have already tested it. I would be grateful if someone could please suggest How should I structure the query. Thank you in advance.</p>",

So you're not referencing Observation/440 this way. <br>\nIf you just want to test if Observation/440 has some Diagnosticreport resource that references it, you could try Observation?_id=440&amp;_hasDiagnosticReport:result:date=gt1800 - the date=gt1800 is a dummy criterium which always resolves to 'true' (assuming that date element will be always populated in your project)</p>",
