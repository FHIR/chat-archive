Some relationships seem incorrect because some of the values on the right-hand side of the table do not exist in the C-CDA documentation of the templates (<a href=\"https://hl7.org/ccdasearch/templates/2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.4.html\">https://hl7.org/ccdasearch/templates/2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.4.4.html</a> - template that should be mapped to Condition). Could someone explain it briefly to me? Thanks in advance!</p>",
