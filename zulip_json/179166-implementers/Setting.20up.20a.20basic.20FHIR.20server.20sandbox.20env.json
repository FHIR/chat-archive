I'm working on various projects that wrap a FHIR interface around something else; to help API clients work on integration with our FHIR API (without hitting the real, proxied backend), I'd like to run a multi-tenant read/write FHIR server in our sandbox environment that just serves as the stand-in.</p>\n<p>Is HAPI FHIR the best candidate for something like this? I do see the JPA-starter project, and some documentation on a DB-partition-based multi-tenancy option:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter\">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/docs/server_jpa_partitioning/partitioning.html\">https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/docs/server_jpa_partitioning/partitioning.html</a></p>\n<p>This looks fairly possible.</p>\n<p>Other suggestions that people have used to fill this kind of role?<br>\nOr pitfalls we may run into with hapi-fhir?<br>\nMost of my fellow devs don't have deep Java experience, but my expectation is to get this running without 0much customization involved, and we can focus on our core product.</p>\n<p>I've been leaning towards OSS (since we'll probably turn off a lot of pieces that we're doing ourselves, like authentication/authorization and message validation).</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions!</p>",
