In the world of referrals, there are plenty of other potential values like Parent, Substitute decision maker, etc... </p>\n<p>Let's say I want to use \"Parent\". The closest code would be O - Other. My current theory on what to do is:<br>\ncontact.relationship.coding.code = O<br>\ncontact.relationship.coding.display = Other<br>\ncontact.relationship.text = Parent</p>\n<p>Is this correct?</p>",
