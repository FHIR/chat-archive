I know we have some intentional leeway for servers to return relevant resources, but I expected the default behavior would be to apply multiple criteria using AND.  However, reviewing the <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/branches/R4B/http.html#search\">REST API</a> and <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/branches/R4B/search.html\">Search Handling</a>, the only guidance is:</p>\n<p><code>The server determines which of the set of resources it serves meet the specific criteria...</code> from the <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/branches/R4B/search.html#Introduction\">Search Introduction</a></p>\n<p>I expect most clients are assuming AND logic, and maybe that is just a broad assumption we didn't feel needed to be specified, but is there actually anything in any spec (FHIR or referenced RFC) that actually names that behavior?  I couldn't find any.</p>",

This is known as an AND search parameter, since the server is expected to respond only with results which match both value'</p>",
