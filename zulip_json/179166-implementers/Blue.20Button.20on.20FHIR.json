Cool.  Based on this, I went and implemented the following schemas:</p>\n<p>AllergyIntolerance<br>\nBinary<br>\nCondition<br>\nCoverage<br>\nDiagnosticReport<br>\nDocumentReference<br>\nFamilyMemberHistory<br>\nImmunization<br>\nMedication<br>\nMedicationOrder<br>\nMedicationStatement<br>\nObservation<br>\nPatient<br>\nProcedure <br>\nProcedureRequest<br>\nSchedule<br>\nSlot</p>\n<p>And Cerner has published the resources it supports at <a href=\"http://fhir.cerner.com/dstu2/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhir.cerner.com/dstu2/\">http://fhir.cerner.com/dstu2/</a></p>\n<p>Cerner<br>\nAllergyIntolerance<br>\nAppointment<br>\nBinary<br>\nCarePlan<br>\nCondition<br>\nContract<br>\nDevice<br>\nDiagnosticReport<br>\nDocumentReference<br>\nEncounter<br>\nGoal<br>\nImmunization<br>\nMedicationOrder<br>\nMedicationStatement<br>\nObservation<br>\nPatient<br>\nPerson<br>\nProcedure<br>\nRelatedPerson</p>\n<p>Of these, there are only 10 resources that are supported by both Epic AND Cerner:</p>\n<p>AllergyIntolerance<br>\nBinary<br>\nCondition<br>\nDiagnosticReport<br>\nImmunization<br>\nMedicationOrder<br>\nMedicationStatement<br>\nObservation<br>\nPatient<br>\nProcedure</p>\n<p>Now then... what does BlueButton support?  According to <a href=\"http://HealthIT.gov\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://HealthIT.gov\">HealthIT.gov</a>, it seems they at least support:</p>\n<p>Immunization<br>\nMedicationOrder<br>\nMedicationStatement</p>\n<p>But they also talk about \"Have your medical history available in case of emergency, when traveling, seeking a second opinion, or switching health insurance companies\".  So, what does that mean?  Conditions?  Procedures?  CarePlans?  Diagnostic Reports?  </p>\n<p>I'd be all for getting my clients accessing CMS claims data via an OAuth connector.   I just need some specifics of which resources, exactly, to expect.  Or does CMS support all 100+ FHIR resources?  </p>",
