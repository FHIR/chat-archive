I noticed AIBox has a gateway layer before FHIR,  so the gateway layer has exactly same FHIR REST end point definitions but can hook business rules security rules before the request can reach FHIR?</p>",

However, if an application architecture is designed that the FHIR is EMR storage itself, it is  kind of like expose database to external system directly without business rule check, such as reject patient post if an existing patient has same health card number.  In this case,  where is the place to hook business rules to reject a FHIR request?</p>",
