        "content": "<p>We are implementing several FHIR services, and are starting to look into how best to query the services in relation to the resources they use. Most of the endpoints refer to the same business object as their resource type name implies, like Patient and Encounter, and are consistent with only one common profile each. For some endpoints we have a different business object than the resource; “critical information about a patient” is a Flag resource and “requisitioner” is Practitioner resource, and other business objects might use the same base resources in the future. From what I understand there are several ways you can choose to address these resources (using Flag as an example):<br>\n-   Use the base Flag resource, and do a query for the specific profile ([base]/Flag?_profile=profilename)<br>\n-   Use the base Flag resource and use a custom operation to specify the business object ([base]/Flag/$operationname?_lastUpdated=ge2016-08-22T13:51:58)<br>\n-   Use the List base resource, querying on code or title to specify the business object, adding the reverse include to get the Flag items (?). Are there any limitations to this, implied meaning in the list object or other issues?<br>\nAre there any other ways of doing this, and/or what is the preferred way to do this?</p>",
