I have been able to validate one example and then one profile using the validate command<br>\ne.g. for validation of an example I used the following command</p>\n<p>./hapi-fhir-cli validate  --fhir-version dstu3 --file C:\\Test\\examples\\Test-Example-1.xml</p>\n<p>and this worked, but what command would I use to validate this xml example against the profile that it references in its &lt;meta&gt; tag using this command line tool?<br>\nI have posted this question at <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hapi-fhir/sRm7CDXOfwM\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hapi-fhir/sRm7CDXOfwM\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hapi-fhir/sRm7CDXOfwM</a> but no answer has been received yet, so I thought this would be another forum where expertise might exist on this subject. <a href=\"user_uploads/2/d9/Erq92jgma2s6GeHJMIWiK3ZZ/Test-Example-1.xml\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"user_uploads/2/d9/Erq92jgma2s6GeHJMIWiK3ZZ/Test-Example-1.xml\">Test-Example-1.xml</a></p>",
