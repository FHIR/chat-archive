If I POST a transaction bundle to the server I get a 200 response but the response itself does not follow the standard for transaction bundles. I don't recall where I found that link. The link <a href=\"http://test.fhir.org/r4\">http://test.fhir.org/r4</a>  shown on the confluence page of test servers I assume is a FHIR server (however it seems to be down and is unreachable). Should I expect a terminology server to handle RESTFul FHIR? If not, what is the purpose of such a server and how would I use it?<br>\nThanx!!</p>",
