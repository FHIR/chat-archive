There is a lot of talk about canonical in the spec, but it doesn't actually say whether we expect a data element of the canonical datatype to be an absolute URI or whether it is allowed to be relative.</p>",

However for published conformance resources, canonical urls must be absolute. Use a domain that is under your control, e.g. your company url. For examples resources, it is common practice to use \"<a href=\"http://example.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://example.org\">example.org</a>\".</p>",
