        "content": "<p>Thanks for the reply. So what I'm after (taking your example) is to have a decision tree that would decide what observation pattern an observation would conform to, and what shape that observation would be. So for the waist circumference example you gave, that is declared as being a vital sign key-value pair, so you'd expect that observation to have a key, value (with appropriate units etc.), and a category of \"vital sign\".<br>\nSo in effect I'm not planning to profile out all Observations, but document them as being \"types\" of observation.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191506\">@Yunwei Wang</span> Good question. Initially i'd thought it would be a profile creation decision tree (as in the UK we do a lot of push messaging rather than RESTful interactions), but I guess that once you've decided on the pattern used for an Observation you could harness ObservationDefinition to define a minimum viable construct for the Observation that could be used by a server implementor. So for the above example from Domenico the decision tree could say that a  Waist Circumference is a vital sign that has a single key-value pair, and an ObservationDefinition could be created as<br>\n&lt;ObservationDefinition xmlns=\"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir\">http://hl7.org/fhir</a>\"&gt;<br>\n    &lt;categoey&gt;<br>\n        &lt;coding&gt;<br>\n            &lt;system value=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-category\"/&gt;<br>\n            &lt;code value=\"vital-signs\"/&gt;<br>\n        &lt;/coding&gt;<br>\n    &lt;/category&gt;<br>\n    &lt;code&gt;<br>\n        &lt;coding&gt;<br>\n            &lt;system value=\"http://loinc.org\"/&gt;<br>\n            &lt;code value=\"8280-0\"/&gt;<br>\n            &lt;display value=\"Waist Circumference\"/&gt;<br>\n        &lt;/coding&gt;<br>\n    &lt;/code&gt;<br>\n    &lt;identifier&gt;<br>\n        &lt;system value=\"MyServer\\ObservationTypes\"/&gt;<br>\n        &lt;value value=\"Waist Circumference\"/&gt;<br>\n    &lt;/identifier&gt;<br>\n    &lt;permittedDateType value=\"integer\"/&gt;<br>\n    &lt;multipleResultsAllowed value=\"false\"/&gt;<br>\n    &lt;quantativeDetails&gt;<br>\n        &lt;unit&gt;<br>\n            &lt;system value=\"http://unitsofmeasure.org\"/&gt;<br>\n            &lt;code value=\"cm\"/&gt;<br>\n            &lt;display value=\"centimeter\"/&gt;<br>\n        &lt;/unit&gt;<br>\n    &lt;/quantativeDetails&gt;<br>\n&lt;/ObservationDefinition&gt;</p>\n<p>Am I just being a bit naive here?</p>",
