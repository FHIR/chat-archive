        "content": "<p>I have had questions come up recently regarding DocumentReference classification in relation to \"type\" and \"category\".</p>\n<p>The document in question is an immunization history document. We were attempting to locate a suitable code from <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/valueset-c80-doc-typecodes.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/valueset-c80-doc-typecodes.html</a> to associate, but I was not able to find anything that really matched. There is LOINC 82593-5 \"Immunization Summary Report\", but that is not available within the FHIR preferred type value set.</p>\n<p>Is this something where we should be using as a \"category\" classification instead? 11369-6 \"History of Immunization Narrative\" is another one for example. If so, in this scenario, and ones similar, is it acceptable to have a document type of 11503-0 \"Medical records\"?</p>\n<p>Another document that we've had other \"type\" and \"category\" association discussions around are advanced directives.</p>\n<p>I'm not as concerned specifically with each individual document that comes up, I am more-so looking for any guidance to help when there does not appear to be a relatable type code in the preferred set. Hope my examples help!</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",
