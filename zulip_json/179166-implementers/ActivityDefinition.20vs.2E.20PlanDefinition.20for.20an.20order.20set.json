So if ActivityDefinition cannot be used to define the order set, is the wording in the IG correct? \"It may be used to specify actions to be taken as part of a workflow, order set, or protocol, or it may be used independently as part of a catalog of activities such as orderables.\" This reads as though it could be either the order itself or the entire order set. Can you clarify?</p>",
