I am fairly new to fhir and wanted to see if you could help me with some questions:</p>\n<p>Does the practitionerRole fhir object dictate the rights and roles a particular user have? if so, how how does it? does a practitioner have multiple practitioner role records in the same organization? or does he have multiple practitioner roles scattered throughout multiple organizations.</p>\n<p>I am very confused as to what to tie a policy to. Policy as in a set of actions a user can do on a system. because i see practitioner roles in the fhir spec and it seems like policies should be tied to that.</p>\n<p>and more importantly, what dictates where the practitioner works? the practitioner role right?</p>",
