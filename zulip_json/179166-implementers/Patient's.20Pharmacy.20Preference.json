Current experience with our National e-Prescription Service is that this choice can be specific to an individual medication and/or whether the prescribing takes place virtually (nearest pharmacy to residency likely to be chosen) or at a healthcare facility (often pharmacy next door). Community Pharmacists as part of a Care Team is certainly desirable, particularly with complex patient medication regimes, but the world of community dispensing is moving beyond dedicated healthcare facilities to generic retail outlets.</p>",

My takeaway is, there is not an accepted location to transmit the patient's preferred pharmacy information (a standard piece of information here in the NorthEast USA). Our system stores, at rest, in a FHIR resource style; we will store this information in either \"Careteam\" or \"generalPractitioner\". The information will travel within the medicationRequest; however, medication requests are transient, not resting, in our system. What I mean by this is, we would need to reference a previous medicationRequest in order to ascertain preferred pharmacy. In order for intake administrative staff to be able to update the patient's pharmacy preference, they will need to carry out this update within a resting resource. Even careTeam can be transient, can it not? as the careTeam changes with various conditions being tested or treated; therefore storing under the \"Patient\" resource, within generalPractitioner seems most reasonable to me. <br>\nIf someone sees that I am running off the rails here, I would sure like to hear from you within this forum. <br>\nI am new to FHIR and eager to learn.
