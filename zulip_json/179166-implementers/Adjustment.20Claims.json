For void records, did you make fields negative so that the fields negate the original claim?  Example fields would be all financials, quantity fields, and days.  For financial records, do you anticipate that only the financial fields would be filled out on the record but fields for quality fields and days have a value of “0”?  Or do you expect that full replacement records would be sent and the original claim dropped?  If that is the case what matching criteria do you use?  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191430\">@Paul Knapp</span> We would appreciate your input here if you have any suggestions.</p>",
