If there is one I would expect it to say full history. You could probably, IANAL, that patient access api requires data back to 2016-01-01 so any history before that date would be excluded. If Patient Access API required history of resources at all.</p>\n<p>This is a technical forum, as with any \"what does regulation require me to do?\" questions, consult the lawyer that is going to have to represent you in front of said regulatory agency. In my case, I work for a payer in the US. I can't speak to what AU might require you to do, and likely neither could my company's US lawyers.</p>",
