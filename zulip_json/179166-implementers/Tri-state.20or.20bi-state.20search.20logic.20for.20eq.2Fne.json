If I ask for a resource that contains code X, and code is not present, obviously the resource will not be returned in either case.  But when I ask for resources where code ne X, and code is NOT present, is the interpretation that I should or should not or should not return the resource.  My original assumption was to return the resource if the query is code ne X and the resource does not have a value for code.  However, given that we also have support for code:missing=false and code:missing=true, one might assume that tri-state logic rules are in effect.  I would prefer not to assume that.</p>",
