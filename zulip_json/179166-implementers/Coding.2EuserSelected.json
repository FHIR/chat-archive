Regarding your points at the top of this thread, the principle DoF (incl. the Continua FHIR guidelines &amp; PHD IG) is advancing is the need to keep the semantics originally communicated from the device as the \"origin source of truth\" and then any mappings that are needed to facilitate use by consuming systems down the line.   </p>\n<p>We have 1:1 mappings for all 11073 MDC UoM to UCUM and it really doesn't matter what the ordinal sequence is.   Currently, we are also mapping a few 100 physio monitor parameters to LOINC, some 1:1 others M:1 ... thus in the latter case, the need to include the original.</p>\n<p>Note:  We are currently drafting a mapping table (ball in my court) from 11073 MDC vital parameters to the LOINC vital profile parameters, to ensure consistent mappings.</p>\n<p>That said, we are open to the approach that you would like us to take, as long as we are able to achieve this principle of maintaining the origin source of truth values.</p>",

Use an extension to convey IEEE units (and use the main <code>Quantity.code</code> to convey the translated ucum units</p>",
