They don't provide any general level of interoperability.  SDC does add some extensions to make it easier to populate data into questionnaires.  In principle, I suppose it could also make it easier to extract that data, but it'd be clunky.  You'd still have trouble discovering the right questionnaire responses and you'd be reliant on systems making use of extensions as it's not a \"standard\" (read 'common') set of behavior for systems that support questionnaires.</p>",
