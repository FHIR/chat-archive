For example, if I want to update just the name element on a Patient resource, so I send the \"name\" part only in an update request. The HAPI test server at <a href=\"http://fhirtest.unh.ca\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhirtest.unh.ca\">fhirtest.unh.ca</a> will update the name, but blank out the rest of the fields, rather than update the name and keep the rest of the fields as-is. Is this a bug, or is there a specific method for updating part of a record?</p>",
