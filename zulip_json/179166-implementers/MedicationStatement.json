A few different thoughts come to mind, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have a prescription written at discharge, then that could fit into the community category, which is defined as including orders for medications to be administered or consumed by the patient in their home</li>\n<li>By contrast, if you want to represent that reconciliation took place and what corresponding actions were taken on each medication order/request during that reconciliation process, then you might consider using List to represent the meds list as a snapshot in time.</li>\n</ul>",

In some cases, MedicationStatement.dosage.doseQuantity.code may imply form (e.g. doseQuantity could be something like 2 tablets or 3 capsules).  That said, there are a lot of variations to consider, so that won't always work....</p>",
