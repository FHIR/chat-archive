With the uploads I am doing, it was possible to support versions 2, a couple of version 3 variants using HAPI FHIR 3.1.0 (the version prior to introducing Observation.derivedFrom over Observation.related). The small changes that were needed were hacks on the generated String because the hacks were simple enough.</p>\n<p>That becomes difficult with this latest change.</p>\n<p>Even if I can include several models, my concern is the size. It is already BIG.</p>\n<p>Anybody done this? How about supporting multiple versions on a PC (it has a few more resources)?</p>",
