        "content": "<p>Hi All,<br>\nI sent the next mail to fhir mail list:</p>\n<p>How the FHIR Specification is considering de Clinical Process concept?. We understand the Clinical Process as the collection of episodes of care and other healthcare activities done for differents organizations around the same health problem or desease. For example, for the treatment of a chronic desease like the diabetes, to have the ability of traceability of every activity, visit, contact, medication, procedures.. done by all participants in a Health Community: the General Practicioner, Emergency physicians and Specialist physicians in different hospitals, medical centers and Primary care.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Lloiyd's response:</p>\n<p>You can do that using a single EpisodeOfCare across all organizations if policy/technical capacity permit.  You can also link multiple EpisodeOfCare instances to say \"these are all representing the same episode\" using the Linkage resource.</p>\n<p>Dan Russler's response:</p>\n<p>You might want to use the \"episode of care\" definition use by insurance company analytic systems or the \"episode of illness\" definition that is more accurate for research analytics. The difference is that insurance company algorithms bundle all costs for all diseases into an \"episode of care\" which is labeled with the primary diagnosis. This means the costs allocated to the primary diagnosis are much higher for people with multiple illnesses. Research tries to get a true cost per illness by allocating appropriate costs to the management of each illness.</p>\n<p>Any other suggestion?</p>\n<p>How I can get all information related to a EpisodeOfCare  (Encounter, ImagingStudy, Observation, etc.) in a single request ?</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>",
