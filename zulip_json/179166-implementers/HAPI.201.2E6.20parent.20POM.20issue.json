It  turns out that the parent hapi-deployable-pom POM.xml has the following snippet which is instructing the animal-sniffer-maven-plugin to validate signatures against Java 1.6:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>                    &lt;configuration&gt;\n                        &lt;signature&gt;\n                            &lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.mojo.signature\n                            &lt;/groupId&gt;\n                            &lt;artifactId&gt;java16&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n                            &lt;version&gt;1.1&lt;/version&gt;\n                        &lt;/signature&gt;\n                    &lt;/configuration&gt;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>However, maven-enforcer-plugin in hapi-fhir.pom requires Java 1.8:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>                &lt;execution&gt;\n                    &lt;id&gt;enforce-java&lt;/id&gt;\n                    &lt;goals&gt;\n                        &lt;goal&gt;enforce&lt;/goal&gt;\n                    &lt;/goals&gt;\n                    &lt;configuration&gt;\n                        &lt;rules&gt;\n                            &lt;requireJavaVersion&gt;\n                                &lt;version&gt;[1.8,)&lt;/version&gt;\n                                &lt;message&gt;\n                                    The hapi-fhir Maven build requires JDK version 1.8 or higher.\n                                &lt;/message&gt;\n                            &lt;/requireJavaVersion&gt;\n                        &lt;/rules&gt;\n                    &lt;/configuration&gt;\n                &lt;/execution&gt;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Therefore, I believe we would need all of the \"org.codehaus.mojo.signature\" references in the POM's changed to:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>                    &lt;configuration&gt;\n                        &lt;signature&gt;\n                            &lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.mojo.signature\n                            &lt;/groupId&gt;\n                            &lt;artifactId&gt;java18&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n                            &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;\n                        &lt;/signature&gt;\n                    &lt;/configuration&gt;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>When we changed our local cached hapi-deployable-pom to what's above, our build worked perfectly.  Thanks in advance.</p>",

Yes, as you point out, the good thing about the hapi-fhir one is the list of sensible defaults and dependency versions we don't need to manually copy over to our application's POM.  Regarding the fixes you'll make, where can I pick them up?  Will they be in the nightly build version or could you forward me the fixed pom?</p>",
