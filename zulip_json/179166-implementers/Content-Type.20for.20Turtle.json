That said, especially for bulk data export, I agree that it would be nice to be able to return binary content using the standard REST api. I would prefer to be consistent with the content types for json and xml, and we will need the message type to be specified in the header. Something like \"application/fhir+protobuf; message=org.hl7.fhir.stu3.Patient; fhir-version=3.0\" would work. We could possibly drop the fhir-version since it'll be implied by the message type, or keep it for clarity and consistency.</p>",
