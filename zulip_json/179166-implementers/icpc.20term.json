These were all imported and their fields assigned pro forma by the import algorithm from material published in the V3 coremif release December 2019.

I am pretty sure all of those ICPC variants are among that pile.  Note also that the way the variants are represented in FHIR differs from V3, which did not support the concept of code system supplements.    Hence what you are seeing is the pro forma representation of the v3 model there.
