That is, the timestamp on the PAID claim is <strong>not</strong> when the medication changes hands.  IMO, this would not qualify as a timestamp that could be used in the <em>whenHandedOver</em> field.</p>\n<p>For example, there is a scenario in which the prescription is e-prescribed by the physician.

Once the prescription request is received, the pharmacy will: submit the claim, fill-it and drop it in a basket to wait for the patient – the claim is now \"PAID\".
