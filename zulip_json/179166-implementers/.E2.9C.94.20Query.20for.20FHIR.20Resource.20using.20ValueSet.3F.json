We have created a bunch of FHIR Observations with codes from this ValueSet. Is there a way for a client to ask a FHIR Server to \"give me Observations with Codes from this ValueSet\"? I.e. have the FHIR server expand the ValueSet? Or is it the clients job to first expand it, and then create separate queries for each code? I looked at <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/valueset-operation-expand.html\">this page</a>, but it seems to only be about the expand operation and I want to use the expand operation as part of a FHIR Resource query.</p>\n<p>P.S. I know there is the Observation.category field, which seems related to the purpose of our ValueSet, but since I can see our ValueSet evolve over time and the same code even belonging to different ValueSet depending on our use-cases, coding this into the Observation.category field feels like a brittle solution.</p>",
