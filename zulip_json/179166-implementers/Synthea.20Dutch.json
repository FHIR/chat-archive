This looks like you have an error in your provider files, or you didn't replace the US providers with providers in the Netherlands. The code dealing with provider selection takes into account latitude and longitude, so if there weren't any provider locations within 2 degrees (which varies, but is about 220 kilometers) of your patient address then Synthea won't be able to find any provider locations and you get that NullPointerException.</p>",
