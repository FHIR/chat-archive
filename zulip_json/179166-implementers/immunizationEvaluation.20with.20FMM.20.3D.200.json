Is it a snapshot of the vaccination plan + current administered vaccines? If so, isn't this a bit more complicated than having the vaccination plan and the snapshot of administrations separately? I think it is hard to maintain the lifecycle of a resource that contains a protocol and the realisation of an instanciation of that protocol.</p>",

Essentially the same immunization could be evaluated differently in different places.  One might think you're fully immunized.  Another might think that you need a booster or even that you're not immunized at all.</p>",

Here's an example: My vaccination history is clear, but whether it is timely or not depends on the country I am in.. so it seems less clean to put the protocol in the resource and not in a reference, even if the way vaccines are usually presented is exactly with protocol + administrations in one paper.</p>",
