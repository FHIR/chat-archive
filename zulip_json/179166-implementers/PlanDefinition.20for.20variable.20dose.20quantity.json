I'm not sure how to represent a medication with a dose quantity that should be calculated using existing patient information. For example, I have a drug whose dose quantity is supposed to be 25 mg/kg of patient weight. Has anyone done this before and have an example, or does anyone have any ideas? Thank you!</p>",
