I don't consider them as medications, as they are products of daily life (I use them without a medical indication). Yet I think \"device\" is the wrong resource either. I would prefer \"Substance\", yet I can't say that a substance belongs to or is applied to a certain patient without a procedure.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have an idea? Or am I on the right track and need to link patient and substance via another resource?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for your answers.</p>",
