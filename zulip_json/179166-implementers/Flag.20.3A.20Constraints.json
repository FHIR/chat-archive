There the constraint made to <code>patient.contact</code> is explained. A general description of Contraints can be read at <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/conformance-rules.html#constraints\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/conformance-rules.html#constraints\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/conformance-rules.html#constraints</a>. For <code>patient.contact</code> the constraint says \"SHALL at least contain a contact's details or a reference to an organization\". When you look at the fhirPath, you see that \"contact's details\" mean a name, a telecom, or an address.<br>\nSuch constraints are defined in the StructureDefinition. You can define them when you profile a resource, e.g. with Forge.</p>",
