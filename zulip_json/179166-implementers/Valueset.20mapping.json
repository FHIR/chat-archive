        "content": "<p>Yes, in general this is possible using ConceptMap.  Tyoically the elements for the source and target are bound to value sets (sets of codes selected from one or more code systems).  The mappings are based on the codes in the source and target value sets, and therefore have a separation and a degree of independence from the elements and their data types (e.g. string, code, CodeableConcept, etc.) and bindings.  The potential issue is when one of the elements has the 'boolean' data type (which is presumably the case here), as in that situation there is no actual vocabulary binding or defined value set.  But I think that section 4.9.7 Implicit Code Systems addresses that situation (although not directly), and you should be able to use ConceptMap to make the mapping that you need from \"Yes/No\" to the boolean \"true/false\" values.</p>",
