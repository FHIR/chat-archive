This will help us to understand how other applications are using fhirserver.<br>\nCurrently our imaging systems support HL7 v2. We use Mirth Connect as interface engine.<br>\nAfter we found fhirserver (which supports HL7 v2, FHIR, SNOMED, etc) which is also developed using Delphi, we are thinking of using fhirserver, removing Mirth Connect.<br>\nWhich means, we want to use fhirserver for the below functionalities,<br>\n1.  Run a process which will wait for HL7 v2 messages (Example: ORM). Once received, we want to write to DB or other repository where our systems consumes them.<br>\n•   After I see your library, I understand that it supports till 2.7. This is fine for us.<br>\n2.  Create a small FHIR server, which will receive the FHIR messages (Orders) and in turn these FHIR messages  in our server are consumed by our systems.<br>\n3.  Convert the received HL7 v2 messages to FHIR messages, send them to our FHIR server, and in turn these FHIR messages are consumed by our systems.<br>\n•   To support our existing customers who send HL7 v2 messages to us.<br>\n•   Internally we want our systems to understand FHIR xml’s rather than HL7 v2’s position based messages.</p>\n<p>Are these supported?</p>",
