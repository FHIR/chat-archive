My organization is very interested in implementing a graph API but we don't want to neglect FHIR as the industry has already agreed on FHIR as it's standard. Is it one or the other? Or is there room for FHIR on something other than REST?</p>",

If your interested in seeing some examples, I have been working with my team on developing a FHIR Facade in GraphQL. We are using node.js and express-graphql. It's still a work in progress but our develop branch has support for dstu2 (1.0.2) and stu3 (3.0.1) and have some PR's open for scope checking and oauth. We would love to hear some feedback from others about what features they need the most and how they would like some things to be implemented. You'll notice the spec page is not quite complete, so I think from a community standpoint there is still some discussion/work to be done to determine the best way to handle some things.</p>",
