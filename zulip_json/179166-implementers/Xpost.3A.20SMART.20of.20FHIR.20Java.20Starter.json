I figured hopefully I may receive some advice in this stream.</p>\n<p>Can anyone share a sample Smart of fhir java starter web app? Is session management required when implementing OAuth2.0?<br>\nI see a lot of libraries for Oauth 2.0 client like the Google Client Library but they do not involve session management.</p>\n<p>I  also found the Java SMART of FHIR HSPC Java Client- <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/hspconsortium/java-client/src/develop/\">https://bitbucket.org/hspconsortium/java-client/src/develop/</a>  - but absolutely no documentation. Does anyone have any experience using it or tailoring it to work with R4? </p>\n<p>Any help or guidance is appreciated!</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Joel</p>",
