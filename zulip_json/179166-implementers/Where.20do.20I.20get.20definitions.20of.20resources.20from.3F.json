The UI gives you a list of all fhir resource types, then when one is selected, it presents UI relevant to that type.  What I'm wondering is; where do I get the definitions of these fhir resources?  I'd rather write a tool that indexes these definitions and generates UI based on them, rather than hard coding UI for each resource type, since there are likely to be additions and changes.</p>",

For this use, the file expansions.xml is also useful - but you can only type it's address in directly; it's not not linked to from anywhere</p>",
