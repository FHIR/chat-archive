In <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/condition.20-.20expected.20to.20be.20risk\">this related thread</a>, the suggestion was to use a Condition with a code stating \"risk of X\". But suppose we have no code for \"at risk of X\" but only a code for the condition X itself. Is there some pattern for using just that code plus other fields/generic codes to produce a resource that unambiguously states that the patient at risk of X?</p>\n<p>Some options I considered but was not quite happy with:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use post-coordinated SNOMED codes, e.g. using the \"Risk of\" qualifier (SNOMED 30207005) - requires the downstream systems to be able to handle composite codes (also, not sure what the right correct SNOMED should be <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span>  )</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/riskassessment.html\">RiskAssesment</a> - not sure if that would be an appropriate use of that resource &amp; not sure where the code for X could go (one can reference a Condition, but then I'm not sure what that Condition should hold, given that I don't want to have a resource saying that the patient <em>has</em> X)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(1) might be workable (if I can figure out the right SNOMED expression...), but are there alternatives?</p>",
