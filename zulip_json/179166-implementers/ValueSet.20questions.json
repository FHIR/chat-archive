But when it does, it saves 0 concepts:<br>\nPre-expanded ValueSet[ValueSet/55/_history/1] with URL[Codes.001] - Saved 0 concepts in 38ms</p>\n<p>So, questions:<br>\n1- Do I need to do all of this just to get all the codes of a code system?<br>\n2- Why is it saving 0 concepts and not all of the custom code system? <br>\n({<br>\n    \"resourceType\": \"ValueSet\",<br>\n    \"url\": \"Codes.001\",<br>\n  \"compose\" : {<br>\n    \"include\" : [{<br>\n      \"system\" : \"<a href=\"http://codes\">http://codes</a>\"<br>\n    }]<br>\n  }<br>\n}<br>\n3- Is there a way to reduce the 10 min wait? <br>\n4- Whenever I create a ValueSet, it is created with a random id, like \"55\". Can I specify an id for it to have? Or do I need to take note of all these ids it creates?</p>\n<p>If this is documented anywhere, please point me in that direction, I've been failing to find that info.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
