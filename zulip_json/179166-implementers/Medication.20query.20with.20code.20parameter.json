Since there is only a parameter for code how can I tell the backend that this code comes from a specific system?</p>",

If you read up on the token data type, you'll see that it allows you to match on just the code, code + system and codes that don't have a specified system.  (With modifiers you can do other things too like match on text, do subsumption-based searches, etc.).  E.g. <code>Observation?code=http%3A//loinc.org|12345-6</code>.</p>",
