The term PHR can mean many things. I like how the working group Personal Health Record Work Group (for Electronic Health Records) makes it more explicit what it targets (as I understand, that's what is described in the usecases page referred to in the issue).<br>\nHowever, in Finland we're starting a national PHR that's an independent system solely for patient-generated health data - it's not directly tied to any EMR. And it's essentially just a FHIR server. See <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"50\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/50-finnish-PHR\">#finnish PHR</a> .<br>\nAlso, the term PHR might refer to a person's Apple Health account.<br>\nAgain, I don't know how much this has been discussed outside the issue <a href=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13633\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13633\">http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=13633</a>. The <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"50\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/50-finnish-PHR\">#finnish PHR</a> project might be willing to provide some input for use cases, if that's considered useful.</p>",
