However, if an extension has been removed, that generally means that the work group feels that the extension shouldn't be used anymore, so I'd recommend reaching out to the Patient Administration work group to find out why they got rid of the extension.  (Once we get the registry up, it'll be easier to manage that sort of thing.)</p>",
