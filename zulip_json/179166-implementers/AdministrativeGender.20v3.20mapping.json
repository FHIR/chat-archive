It shows <code>unknown</code> mapping to <code>UNK</code>, but <code>UNK</code> does not appear to be part of the destination value set (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/AdministrativeGender/vs.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/AdministrativeGender/vs.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/AdministrativeGender/vs.html</a>).  Is it supposed to be?  If not, how would one represent an unknown gender using that value set?</p>",

And there isn't an official v3 value set that includes both the administrative genders and the desired null flavor.  Can you submit a tracker item?  (Ideally our build process should be checking that the codes listed in the ConceptMaps actually exist in the expansions of the source and target value sets, which would have caught this issue.)</p>",
