Good and interesting work. One of the teams asked me about whether there's interest in sharing the model outcomes interoperably. Apparently that would mean sharing weighting values for the input variables, along with some information about pre-processing and which AI algorithmic frameworks are being used.</p>\n<p>thoughts?</p>",

But I feel that any such resource should also be able to support something more trivial like a SimCity or Sims or SimHospital model just as well.  So my inclination would be to treat the resource as mostly an envelope, similar to the <code>Media</code> or <code>Binary</code> resources.  Don't assume too much about the structure of the model right now; let's just provide a resource with some metadata for tracking it, and include the model along in a rider/attachment.</p>",
