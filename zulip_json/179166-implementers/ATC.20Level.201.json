Any additional valid ATC codes can be added to that at any time, as needed for any IG or other use case.  We just need to know which concepts are needed - obviously 'C' is one that is, but there may be others?  The best alternative would be if someone is able to provide or we (as in FHIR) are otherwise able to negotiate obtaining an authoritative source for the entire ATC code system that we can load and host (with the licensing considerations properly met). <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"233842\">@Michaela Ziegler</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span></p>",

I do want to clarify that you only need to have those particular top-level codes, and none of the more specific codes beneath them?  If that's the case, then it shouldn't be a problem to add them (I will verify the display strings, etc. with the WHO ATC browser - for the exact capitalization, etc.).  As I mentioned before, if you or anyone else is aware of a comprehensive source that is or can be made available (with proper licensing) for adding the full ATC code system, that would be better.  But in the absence of that we can proceed this way.</p>",
