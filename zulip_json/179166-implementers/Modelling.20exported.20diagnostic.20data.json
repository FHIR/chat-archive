Originally I thought of using Media, but due to the fact that Media.type has a VERY restricted valueset, I will probably end up using Observation.valueAttachment instead, mainly because the values are named audio, video and <strong>photo</strong>. While it may be a little thing and <strong>photo</strong> is actually in FHIR defined as more than just a photo, I would have loved if it was called image or picture instead, as photo according to various dictionaries define photo as something you make using a camera, which is not my case and which not how <strong>photo</strong> is defined in FHIR. The FHIR definition is much broader (<em>The media consists of one or more unmoving images, including photographs, computer-generated graphs and charts, and scanned documents</em>).</p>",
