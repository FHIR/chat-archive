FHIR documentation suggests to use $export in FHIR URL to export build data. But in response of doing so I get a \"404 not found.\" Would anyone know of any solutions/why this error occurs? We're using the open epic test servers found here;<br>\n~~~~~~  <a href=\"https://fhir.epic.com/Specifications?api=10171\">https://fhir.epic.com/Specifications?api=10171</a> ~~~~~~~<br>\n----- resource for bulk data:    <a href=\"https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/index.html\">https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/index.html</a></p>\n<p>And the other APIs are executing perfectly fine from the test servers however the \"Bulk Export\" operation is returning errors. We assume it's because there isn't bulk sample data available. Our work around is supposedly bundling the api calls. We realize that parsing may be necessary with the Bulk API since it would return everything as one document </p>\n<p>thank you!<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191315\">@Josh Mandel</span>.  ??<br>\n:)</p>",
