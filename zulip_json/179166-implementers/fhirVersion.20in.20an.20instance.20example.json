For example would you expect to see the FHIR version carried in the Metadata of an instance example?  Unfortunately, the MessageHeader profile, is not like the CapabilityStatement that has a specific fhirVersion element, so another option could be just to extend the MessageHeader profile to carry the FHIR version.  I would be interested in hearing your thoughts.</p>",
