My original concern was the requirement to follow the vital signs profile when my Observation reported a measurement that was considered a vital sign. That includes the requirement of using LOINC in the code, UCUM in the code for the units of the valueQuantity, and specifying a category.</p>\n<p>In the PCHA profile for reporting measurements from PHD devices (used primarily for remote patient monitoring) there is no category, and the MDC coding system is used. In the valueQuantity, we use MDC codes for the unit code and system, but we do optionally use UCUM in the unit string value to get the best of both worlds (if the UCUM transaltion is known). Since vital signs are fairly common, we are concerned about message bloat when we need to upload data from streaming pulse oximeters or heart rate monitors. Given that the MDC code specifies not only what the measurement is but also frequently the measurement technique (there are several codes that specify heart rate but they are different when the come from a pulse ox, ecg,  bp cuff, or activity monitor) thus we want to keep the MDC code. But that means doubling up on the code.coding and adding a category element.</p>\n<p>In addition, LOINC codes are not provided by the devices, MDC codes are. If there is a future device that measures a heart rate in a different manner (say a continuous bp meter) today's gateway will not be able to map that device to the specified set of LOINC codes because it wont know that it is a vital sign and it will not know the mapping. It will, however, be able to create the MDC code for the Observation.code.coding.code element since it is provided by the device. It does not have to know what the code means.</p>\n<p>As I look at the problem of requiring the vital signs profile its  more a matter of message bloat and future interoperability.  One thing the 11073 specifications have going for it is that it is extensible. Granted the end reader will have to be up to date with the latest codes, but the gateways in the field won't.</p>",

As it is, the gateway has the challenge of handling the medical devices. It is PCHA's hope that more devices will eventually follow the standards. Today many do not and spit out their data in a proprietary manner. To work with these the gateways are already stuck with mapping to the MDC standard.
