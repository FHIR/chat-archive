Such that if:<br>\n1. Location.physicalType = bd then Location.type is using ValueSet1<br>\n2. Location.physicalType = wa then Location.type is using ValueSet2</p>\n<p>I went through the examples but couldn't figure out whether that's possible and allowed. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.</p>",
