To provide a bit of context:</p>\n<p>I derived a use case from the IHE MHD profile, which provides the specs for a FHIR API for XDS networks. If a FHIR client wants to send a document to a XDS network, it uses the ‘Provide Document Bundle’ transaction. The MHD spec states that the referenced Patient / Practitioner / Organization resources shall be included as contained resources in the DocumentReference. Our expectation was that this is because the server on the XDS network does not allow to GET the Patient and Practitioner resources but only the DocumentReference because the server cannot do anything with those resources in a XDS DocumentEntry. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191404\">@John Moehrke</span>  </p>\n<p>In our use case, we are sending Media resources but we do not want to use the contained resources in the Media. We do however want to take the FHIR servers on top of XDS networks into account. That raises the above-mentioned question.</p>",

However the problem you are describing is represented within MHD for List (Folders) Resources. MHD allows the transaction to succeed if the server is happy with everything but the Folder.  This is allowed in XDS too, so this is why MHD allows it. The expectation is that this is a Transaction of a specific type, so there could be rules in that specific type of transaction implementation guide (IHE Profile... aka MHD). I expect Trial Implementation to uncover if this is a problem or not.</p>",
