Are you just looking for confirmation (no pun intended!) that these are the correct elements to use or is there another underlying question (such as a more specific association between verificationStatus and evidence)?</p>",

        "content": "<p>I can run it by Patient Care work group, but I don't think you should reference the <strong>order</strong> for the blood test - before the results are in - as evidence that this condition has been confirmed.  Confirmation of the condition happens after the results/reports are available.  However, in re-reading the definition of Condition.evidence, we may need to revisit whether the evidence can be for suspected/confirmed conditions as well as refuted conditions (as well as orders/requests to get evidence).</p>",

Would it benefit us all to have it part of the base resource? I would not reference the order but only reference it if it were the contributing factor for the \"confirmation\" of the condition. It seems logical to associate this evidence with the status. Will await your thoughts on this.</p>",
