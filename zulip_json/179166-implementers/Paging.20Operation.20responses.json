My current thought is to have the Operation include an out parameter that is the \"next-archive\" pointer (from RFC 5005 Archived Feeds).  </p>\n<p>The specific use case is Provider Directory.  We are currently thinking of an Operation to pull down the directory.  However there are a few components of the directry:<br>\n1. A parameter containing a Bundle (type=collection) of Endpoint/Organization/Practitioner/PractitionerRole/etc.<br>\n2. A parameter containing \"metadata\" about the directory.  TBD on the structure of that.</p>\n<p>I don't think the normal Bundle paging approach would work well because you want to page the entire set of parameters, not just the bundle parameter.</p>\n<p>An alternative is to just have the Operation return a Bundle at the top (i.e. no Parameters/parameter), and find a way to fit the metadata inside the bundle.  I'm open to ideas/opinions on approach.</p>",
