Is it correct if I consider the category of murmur holosystolic, early, late and mid as components for an Observation?</p>\n<p>2. The intensity is divided into grades starting from grade 1 to grade 6, quality has musical, non musical, blowing and harsh which needs to be attached or linked to the above mentioned components. So, shall I slice the coding element of the above mentioned components (holosystolic, early etc)to indicate the intensity and quality, then create an extension to store the sub divisions (grade 1 to 6, musical, non musical etc)respectively. </p>\n<p>Thank you</p>",
