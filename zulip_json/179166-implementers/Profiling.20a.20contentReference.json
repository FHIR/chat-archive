For example, if I unroll Observation.component.referenceRange, and constrain only the \"meaning\" sub-element, I assume the snapshot needs to contain the complete unrolling (low, high, meaning, etc) -- but does the differential only include the \"meaning\" element (and the Observation.component.referenceRange intermediate path)?  Or does the differential contain it all since I unrolled the whole thing?</p>",
