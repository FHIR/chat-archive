My question is what happens if the specified resource type is Binary.  Is the invocation of the operation allowed to follow the same behaviors as if you were doing a GET on Binary - i.e. you can actually get back the raw binary instance (XHTML, PDF, JPEG, etc.) or does it have to be in standard resource format?</p>",
