        "content": "<p>The exclusion of data elements that aren't widely used across the spectrum of healthcare isn't a defect/deficiency.  It's a FHIR design feature.  It ensures that the base resources are lightweight and easy to understand and also that it's very clear to implementers which data elements they should expect wide support for (and correspondingly, what they shouldn't necessarily expect support for).  It's one of the things that makes FHIR easy to use and it also drives interoperability by encouraging consistency.  If you don't support a core element in FHIR, it's reasonable to ask the question \"why\" and it's an obvious place to consider adding capability.  On the other hand, if you don't support one of the 100+ \"core\" elements in PID+PD1, there's absolutely no incentive to consider adding it because there's no indication how likely it is for anyone else to do so.</p>\n<p>HL7 defines \"common\" extensions for data elements that aren't used on a sufficiently wide basis to justify their inclusion in the resource, but which are still sufficiently common and consistent across the world that defining a \"standard\" way to do it is useful.  It gives implementers a starting place to look when they face a requirement that they can't find in the immediate resource.  If you can't find something in core <em>or</em> the standard extensions, then asking on <a href=\"http://chat.fhir.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://chat.fhir.org\">chat.fhir.org</a> is a good strategy because there may be a standard way to do what you want that you've missed/misunderstood.  And if not, it may be that the community will encourage you to submit a change request to add the capability to the specification - likely as a core extension.  On the other hand, if it's not supported and it's esoteric to a particular country or extremely niche area, you still have the ability to convey the data using a custom extension - and have the option of further standardizing its use through an implementation guide that applies to the relevant community.</p>\n<p>In the case of birthPlace, it's really only relevant to systems that are deeply involved with identity management - which is a very small subset of the systems that create and manage Patient instances - thus why it's handled as an extension rather than core.</p>",

I guess birthplace is important for MPIs and insurance systems, identity management systems, but not 'every system'.   I also raised the question a while back about birthDate (and time) and was told about the patient-birtdatetime (?) extension.  I guess the question as to how many systems need to know about the time of birth is another one 'in the grey area'; yes, this too could be used in an MPI, for example, in helping to differentiate multiples born on the same date, or in baby care (again with multiples), or in neonatal care where the date and time makes a difference on care treatments (yes, hours are very important to neonates).   Oh well, these decisions have already been made and as an individual, I don't have enough of a justification for \"petitioning\" (via gForce) for considering them for core use.  I suspect many in the \"end user\" (not committee) community do not have the wherewithal or bandwidth to work through when things that they feel are very important to their use case(s) are important (or not) to the community as a whole.</p>",

An extension, because those countries using common law don't really care about it, but most other countries do.

I'm very familiar with the issues around date/times and timezones, etc.; I've worked on products that have to deal with this; it is very complicated.  (If only Ben Franklin didn't come up with DST! ;-) )    However, having a birthdate only  doesn't always solve the problem. For example, if I need to calculate the hours since birth, how does the system know what time zone that date was recorded in?   Do I then also need to record (somewhere) the birthPlace ( ;-) ) and the time zone and the timezone offset, specifically for that instance (because time zone switches can change over time by local laws.)    One approach is to convert the local date (date/time really) into UTC since that really represents the 'exact instant in time' but now you've lost the 'where this occurred' info.   Not an easy problem and I suppose, people/systems will come up with their own way of handling it.  However, the need for birthDate as date/time values doesn't go away, and to your point, maybe it's not in the 80% of the use cases so it's best left out of the core (and the complications only left to those systems that have to deal with it.)</p>",
