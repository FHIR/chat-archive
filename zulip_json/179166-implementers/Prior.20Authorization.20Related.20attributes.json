Instead the structure is insurance 0..* Reference(Coverage|ClaimResponse) - this assumes that they only way to get a Pre Auth Number is via a ClaimResponse - which is a very heavy way to convey a short string and ignores the reality that the Pre Auth Number may have been supplied in correspondence such as email or a letter or over the phone.</p>\n<p>If in your use case there will always be a ClaimResponse then you could include a reference to that resource, otherwise I'd suggest putting in a ballot comment in the upcoming ballot and reviewing the approach for proper handling of the Pre Auth Number with Financial Management, Attachments and Pharmacy at the September HL7 WGM meeting.</p>",

In our case , app is intended for providers who will be querying that if a prior auth required for a medication as per the benefit plan ( PBM ) that patient is holding. If PA is required , so they will send the claim resource (I'm just assuming)  to the Payer and get  response (ClaimResponse ) from Payer back. If it's approved then he might include that  auth number in the med order and send that to preferred pharmacy selected.  This is the workflow that we might be implementing. Still analyzing.</p>",
