To create a FHIR instance (of Questionnaire or anything else), decide if you're going to use JSON or XML and then use JSON Schema or XML Schema respectively (found on the 'downloads' page) to guide you.  When you're done, try validating using the FHIR validator - also found on the downloads page.  You might find it helpful to look at the examples in the spec as well.</p>",

I'm working on being able to generate the profiles from the logical models, but it is a work in progress...</p>\n<p>It does have some limitations with the more complex resources (like questionnaire) which I hope to address in time, but it will never be a fully comprehensive application (unless the resourcing available changes considerably :) ).</p>\n<p>Having said all of that I do welcome input and endeavour to meet peoples requirements - there's a separate stream (<a href=\"https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/clinFHIR\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/clinFHIR\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/clinFHIR</a>) for that.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I am the author...</p>",
