Each country that implemented v3 (or even that implemented CDA separate from CCDA) has typically encoded things differently, so there's no standard transformation that can occur.  (v3 typically allows you to convey the same information 20+ different ways...)  You might explore in your country-specific chat stream to see if there have been any conversion efforts of the country-specific v3 standards.</p>",

We have not found how you could magically infer semantics from a V3 model just because it inherits that from the RIM. Even with an RMIM like CDA there's still too much to be said for a general purpose mapping to work.</p>\n<p>V3 as goes round on the LSP is defined by Nictiz specifications, for as far as it concerns health data that is. Wrappers and infrastructural support messages are defined by VZVZ, but I'm sure those do not have your focus (initially).</p>\n<p>For transformation between information standards, or IGs as they would be called internationally, that Nictiz defines we have said that we would help projects establish that. As it is not a small endeavor we do this when demand is high enough and under proper governance.</p>\n<p>For the LSP there's work in planning phase for a FHIR facade on the V3 inner world. This FHIR facade should be capable to offer a MedMij compliant interface for a growing number of standards. We tested in the Proves programme if this setup would work at all and turns out that you can design this to work.</p>\n<p>The transformations are documented in wiki and executed in XSLT 2.0. The wiki allows you to build your own implementation while the XSLT 2.0 allow us to test if stuff works and if you want you can use them too. We hide nothing.</p>\n<p>Now from your question I can't tell if transformation is what you mean with 'integration', but I'm assuming you do. The only transformation out in the open is currently for Medicatieproces 6.12 and 9.0.6 (soon to be updated to 9.0.7). The next ones will be for GP Data based on Ketenzorg. A known omission is support for errors (in the wrappers). This will soon be dealt with.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/Mappingarchitectuur\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/Mappingarchitectuur\">https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/Mappingarchitectuur</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/Categorie:Mappings\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/Categorie:Mappings\">https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/Categorie:Mappings</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Nictiz/Medicatieproces/tree/master/Publicaties\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Nictiz/Medicatieproces/tree/master/Publicaties\">https://github.com/Nictiz/Medicatieproces/tree/master/Publicaties</a></p>\n<p>Hope that helps. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191437\">@Arianne van de Wetering</span></p>",
