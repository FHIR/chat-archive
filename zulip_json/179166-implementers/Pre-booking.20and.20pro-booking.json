I have established that service request is perhaps best describing the actual demand for a worker. I am still not sure, about the use of appointment to fulfil the bookings. What would be the logic workflow once a servicerequest is defined? Technically speaking Appointment and Appointmentresponses are not part of FHIR workflow. So with a clear mind, is there a resource in FHIR which have the concept saying \" I want to place this practitioner here to response this service request?\" and what would be the resource to use, after when the work is completed to say this is actual event once it has been completed?<br>\nCC:  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191367\">@Brian Postlethwaite</span></p>",

The actual execution from the service provider is Booking (which I guess I used Appointment for). Appointment is booked John Doe to the service request... And then John Doe would have a timesheet.
