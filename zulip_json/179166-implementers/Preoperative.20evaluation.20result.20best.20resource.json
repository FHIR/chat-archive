I need the actual coded result of 'candidate for procedure' or 'not candidate for procedure'. It is somewhat of a point in time observation of the candidacy, but I would also require a coded representation of the procedure in question. The procedure may not yet be an actual 'action' with an associated request/event resource, but just the clinical opinion that this procedure could be performed. There are other observations and conditions that are assessed that lead to the conclusion, but my use case is specifically the actual conclusion of the assessment.</p>\n<p>Is this an observation with an extension, a risk assessment, a diagnostic report for the presurgical evaluation with codedDiagnosis of 'candidate for procedure', or the immature clinical impression (where prognosis doesn't sound like the right attribute name)?</p>",
