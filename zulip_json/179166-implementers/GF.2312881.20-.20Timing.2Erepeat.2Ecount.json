Quoting from the task:</p>\n<p>\"I think this should be more clear in the description of Timing.repeat.count and there should be an example in the table that shows whether/how count should work with frequency/period\"</p>\n<p>MnM agreed that yes, it should be clear. but we don't know which of the 2 options described in the task should be correct. Again, quoting: </p>\n<p>\"(e.g. \"twice daily for 5 days\") then would the count be 5 or 10?\"</p>",
