The clinical folks I talk to know (instinctively) the difference, but technically what or how does a system or a representation like FHIR convey that difference.    One of the suggestions I got was to look at the units for the dose; if it is a rate, then it 'must be an infusion'.  I'm not sure if that's clinically correct but it's an obtuse way of determining this.   In previous products I've worked on (with HL7 V2) we used the frequency (repeat pattern) to determine (differentiate) an infusion from a 'regular med'; if it was 'C' (Continuous) or 'C' (and PRN) it was considered an infusion.   Unfortunately, FHIR doesn't seem to have a concept for \"Continuous\" in the timing.code property (value set: TimingAbbreviation ).   [yes, I can already hear the chorus saying 'use an extension' ;-) -- but why should an extension be needed for something that is so common -- or at least it worked in the V2 world for a long time?]    I also don't feel that is should depend on a Device; there are 'old fashioned' gravity drip infusions that do not use any device (per-se) so I don't think we can depend on a device (like infusion pump) to differentiate infusion from medication.    Then to your point about multiple parts of the infusion; in the V2 world this would be handled by having the RXC-B (base) segments for the non-active solution (fluid) ingredients and the RXC-A (additive) for the active ingredients added to the base solution.   I'm not really sure how that fits into the FHIR Medication model?    (Another method that you could possibly use is to use the dosage.method to determine infusion vs med; this seems to be analogous to the RXR-4 - Administration Method, Table 0165 in V2.)</p>",

As I mentioned before, the clinicians know (instinctively) what they define as an infusion, it seems like there needs to be a way to represent this that isn't a 'side effect' of some other property that may or may not be set (i.e. rate).   There are reasons why this distinction is important, again, I defer to the clinicians among us, but for one important thing is for charting of administrations.   WIth a 'regular med' the expectation is that the charting of admins coincides with the specific times specified by the order, e.g. Q2H, BID, etc. and any deviation from that ordered schedule (frequency) needs to be documented with an exception (the notGiven concept in FHIR and similar in V2).   However, for infusions, the expectation is that they are 'continually running' either until the order specifies a specific stop time or until the complete infusion is given (the bottle/bag is empty).   The charting of infusions then is very different because of this.   (and there are also the more complicated infusions like titrated doses, etc.)    Products I've worked on DO differentiate infusions from medications for some of these very same reasons, so yes, there are use cases for this distinction.</p>",

At least in the V2 world (which probably has equivalent codes/value sets in FHIR) there are things like IV Push, IV Drip, etc. that might or might not be considered infusions (to clinicians -- to technical folks it would seem like anything given with a needle over time must be an infusion but to clinical folks there is a distinction.)    I thought of the same idea with Admin Method, that too has the same problems.</p>\n<p>BTW, the FHIR SNOMED CT Route Codes ( <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/valueset-route-codes.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/valueset-route-codes.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/valueset-route-codes.html</a> ) has a large number of routes that may or may not indicate that a Med Order is an infusion.   <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191832\">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span>  - can you give us some insight into the distinction between infusions and 'regular meds'?</p>\n<p>Found this link that tries to explain what \"infusions\" are: <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/intravenous-medication-administration\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/intravenous-medication-administration\">https://www.healthline.com/health/intravenous-medication-administration</a></p>\n<p>\"Infusion therapy involves the administration of medication through a needle or catheter.\"  </p>\n<p>So,just because the route is 'IV\" doesn't mean that's the only way an infusion is delivered; it can also be delivered via catheters (lines), which would be a different 'route' from a V2 or FHIR perspective.   </p>\n<p>Again, this is why the association of 'Continuous' frequency with an 'infusion\" seems to be a much simpler way to capture the concept.

However, not having the notion of a 'Continuous' frequency makes it harder for systems (or users) that want to use that as part of the way to make that determination.     Using dose rate information as a surrogate for this seems a little bit of a stretch; again, as I point to the use case of 'un-encoded orders' where the rate is not yet set, but it is known that the order is an 'infusion order'.   [BTW, in products I've worked on we use the notion of infusion vs medication to separate out the nurse's workflow, a very important aspect of medication delivery so the use case is definitely there for us; whether or not this is a 'global use case' I can't say but our products have been used world-wide and this has been one of the aspects of our products which has been very important to clinicians acceptance of it.]</p>",

I am not saying you can't use the word but for this discussion - I stay away from the word, because we need more specificity to clarify what folks are talking about.  Now as to the current Pharmacy resources, we do support the ability to order or administer medications that may have an intravenous route of administration, or if needed, we also have the ability to specify the \"method\".  Often the method is not needed.  As I read this thread, my questions are, is someone asking can you make it clear that you have a continuous rate IV solution running on a patient?   is it possible to represent IV Push and Bolus? My answer would be yes.  I will check back on the thread, but not for several days, and if needed can point you to the pharmacy examples where these use cases are represented.

Yes, as a technical (non-clinical) person when I hear the word \"infusion\" I'm not really sure what the clinician is talking about and if they can necessarily state their definition of what it means to them.  As I mentioned, one of the 'classifiers' that they use is the frequency (not the rate) as an indicator of 'infusion' (or not).   The administration method can come into play as well, but the main differentiator seems to be the frequency of 'continuous'.    I've had the clinicians tell me that an IV Push and IV Bolus are not infusions but medications; I believe because it is given over a relatively short period of time, i.e. not continuously.    One of the 'strange corner cases' that I really don't understand is the classification of Colloid orders as either infusions or medications, I think base on dose limits.   As a technical person I would have thought anything that uses an IV route would be an infusion, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

For example, nurses (I've been told) want to see what are the scheduled meds for their shift so that they know when to administer them, whereas infusions (not IV Push or Bolus - which are treated as meds because they are more 'one time/short duration') are handed differently.   When you think about it, the infusions are \"running continuously\" (which is how the clinical experts tell me they differentiate these two concepts) and there are different things they do with infusions, obviously like charting volume per unit time (e.g. 100ml in last hour), if the infusion has started/stopped/paused or rate changed.
