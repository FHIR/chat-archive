At present, the command line tool for uploading the resources to the server, strips any id from the resource body and instead assigns a server defined ID.  Additionally, I came across that the CREATE function uses RESTful POST, which does the reassignment. Using, UPDATE for creation helps set a user defined ID. Can someone provide a way how to upload the files with UPDATE (PUT) using command line or any other way.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>",
