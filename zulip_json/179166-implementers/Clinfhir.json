I think it has a lot of potiential for our business system analysts.  I just connected it to our our FHIR server, which is a HAPI server.  Patient Viewer, Server Query work ok.  The Scenario Builder and Logical Modeller do not work. I get this error \"{\"msg\":\"No matching profile (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/CarePlan\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/CarePlan\">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/CarePlan</a>) found on <a href=\"https://fhir-qa.fmcna.com/STU3/fhirapi/StructureDefinition\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://fhir-qa.fmcna.com/STU3/fhirapi/StructureDefinition\">https://fhir-qa.fmcna.com/STU3/fhirapi/StructureDefinition</a> (but not a server error - just not present)\"}\" . Looks like I need a Structure Definition.  What tools or processes can / should be used to crete the Structure Definitions?  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191319\">@James Agnew</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192784\">@ravi.kuchi</span>  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192782\">@Manju Sampath</span> <br>\nAlso, what is the best way to (1) check for conformance of our HAPI server implementation with the Clinfhir features and (2) train a group of developers and business system analysts on Clinfhir.</p>",

I have been going trough some tutorials. I have been able to upload some patients with observations etc to server. I'm having some trouble with scenario builder. When I'm validating resources I get message: error Error null validating Coding. I still can upload resources. Seems pretty weird. Should I be worried about this error? Or is there some way to get rid of it. My job is at the moment to study FHIR and later on I should be able to start implementing FHIR to our software. I should be able to get out some patient records and measurements from our client made with Qt. In addition to this recent problem: If You have some tutorials or good tips or links for training and implementing in general that would be great!</p>",
