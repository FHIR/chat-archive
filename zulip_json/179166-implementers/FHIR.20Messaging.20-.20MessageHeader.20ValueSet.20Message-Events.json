In the Fhir specs i understand that there isn't and that is something to be agreed between the vendors of the FHIR Messaging integration (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/messaging.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/messaging.html</a>). <br>\nAm i right to assume that the valueSet for this event codes are defined per integration? Or is there a valueSet table already defined?</p>\n<p>Thank you for the attention!</p>",
