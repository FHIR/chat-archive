We're thinking about migrating some of  FHIR's new Implementation Guide infrastructure to GitHub (something like 1 repository per IG, with automatic publishing). One concern: many folks in the FHIR community are new to git, and may need some handholding/support. <strong>Please reply here if you'd be willing to serve as a \"FHIR git guide\"</strong> and provide occasional git (or GitHub) support over zulip. If we can get <strong>about 6 volunteers</strong>, we'd  be comfortable moving forward with this idea. </p>",
