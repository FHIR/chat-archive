In the Continua use case, a server may not allow the client to upload a Patient resource. In that situation the service provider gives the uploader a logical id of the Patient resource that the uploader then uses in the Observation resources that reference the patient. This is to allow protection of PHI. In this manner the patient's name is not exposed anywhere from the device, gateway, and even server.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if a Patient resource is uploaded, I need to specify that certain transactions must be allowed. I don't see a way to do that in the CapabilityStatement.</p>",
