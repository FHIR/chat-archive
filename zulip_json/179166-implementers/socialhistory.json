However, you'll need to think about whether those observations should be components or separate observations.  They each seem like they could be understood on their own.  And I don't think it's true to say they are almost always captured and reviewed together.  So what you'd likely have is an Observation that said \"At what age did drug use start?\" as the code, and components for drug and method.  Then a separate Observation of \"At what age did drug use end?\" with the same components, and the same sort of thing for frequency and total time.  You could choose to create a grouping Observation based on drug as well if you wished (e.g. called \"Drug usage\") with the same components, but there'd be no need to do that.</p>",
