I found the page <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/mappings.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/mappings.html\">http://build.fhir.org/mappings.html</a> on which two links to such bindings are mentioned (SNOMED CT Concept Domain Binding and SNOMED CT Attribute Binding). Unfortunately both links are dead. Has anyone working links for those resources ? Or are they offline because of digital rights issues ? Or has anyone another recommendation which resouces exist on this topic ?<br>\nGreetings<br>\nGeorg</p>",
