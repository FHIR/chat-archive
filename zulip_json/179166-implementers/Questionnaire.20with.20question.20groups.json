        "content": "<p>Hi, I am using Forge (version 14.7, San Antonio 2017 Edition) to create a questionnaire with a number of questions grouped into their own sections. The group element, which contains the different sections, requires a discriminator or definition. I set the discriminator to be \"@type\", and this removes the validation error (also \"@profile\" works fine). However, if I save the profile, close Forge, reopen Forge and then reopen the profile file, the discriminator is no longer there, despite my saving it. I get the same validation error I had before. Could anyone please tell me how to make a save to the profile group element that lasts? Everything else in my profile saves just fine.</p>",
