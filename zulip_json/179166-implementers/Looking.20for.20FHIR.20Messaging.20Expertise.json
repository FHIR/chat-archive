However, it was decided to recast the proposed FHIR operation to a FHIR messaging paradigm.</p>\n<p>We wanted to draw on your expertise with FHIR messaging to understand the risks, benefit and answer some technical implementation details and issues such as:</p>\n<p>·        Experience and use of MessageDefinition</p>\n<p>·        Experience and use of $process-message</p>\n<p>·        Framework for the receiver to query for additional information.</p>\n<p>·        Mapping to V2 ADT messaging</p>\n<p>·        Cost benefit vis a vis V2 messaging for not native FHIR systems</p>\n<p>Our community calls are Wednesdays from 12 - 1 PM EDT (I realize for some of you that is rather late in your day), so I was wondering, if you would be able to join our next one on 8/14/2019</p>",
