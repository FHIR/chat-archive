From my recollection, the US CM variant tends to have the most complexity, with up to 7 character codes (I don't recall the other variants having that many).  But if the available distribution files fully enumerate the valid (i.e. billable in the US) codes, then the length of the code doesn't really matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Much more complex in China.  There are more than a dozen of regional variants of ICD-10, including recently published version by the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA, Equivalent to US CMS) .  And the number of digits can reach up to 11 (e.g.,  A00.000x001 for <em>Cholera due to Vibrio cholerae 01, biovar cholerae</em>).</p>",
