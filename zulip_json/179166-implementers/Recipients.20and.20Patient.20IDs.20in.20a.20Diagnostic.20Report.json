Communication Resource vs listing recipients within a Document Manifest.  ?   Does it matter?<br>\n2. Listing Patient IDs as a contained Patient Resource within Diagnostic Report or separately in a claims resource?  ID is used for billing purposes too.  </p>\n<p>thanks,<br>\nK</p>",

DocumentManifest is passive.  It represents metadata about a document.  It's also intended for use with documents only (and a DiagnosticReport won't necessarily be represented that way)<br>\n2. Links to Patient should appear everywhere they apply - so in a DiagnosticReport both the report itself, as well as every Observation in the report, every Specimen, etc. will <em>all</em> point to the relevant Patient.  (There's no context conduction in FHIR - every resoruce instance must be able to stand alone.)</p>",
