Say we have a root_url of <a href=\"http://www.acme.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.acme.com\">http://www.acme.com</a>, and a path of /fhir.  Should /metadata be at <a href=\"http://www.acme.com/metadata\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.acme.com/metadata\">http://www.acme.com/metadata</a> or <a href=\"http://www.acme.com/fhir/metadata\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.acme.com/fhir/metadata\">http://www.acme.com/fhir/metadata</a>?  We implemented it as the former, because I read the Argonaut Sprint 2 spec as to mean that the /metadata route should be at a consistent location relative to the domain; where as the FHIR spec seems to indicate that it should be relative to the [base] url which includes the API path.</p>\n<p>ps.  sorry for the cross-posting.  Still figuring out where the best place to post argonaut implementation questions.  :)</p>",
