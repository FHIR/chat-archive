        "content": "<p>Currently, Immunization.vaccineCode is used to indicate the administered vaccines (typically with a CVX code, NDC, SNOMED code, etc). Sometimes that code is very specific (eg. an NDC) if the administering provider is documenting and sometimes it's very vague (eg. \"flu\") if it's a historical dose being documented. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191832\">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> has expressed interest in using Medication instead of a just a code and we're looking for feedback on how to implement this. The simplest thing might be to change vaccineCode to be a CodeableReference that allows a code and/or reference to Medication. This would be inline with how MedicationUsage and MedicationAdministration do things. Or we could leave vaccineCode as it is and add a new .administeredProduct element as a CodeableReference. Is there a preference from folks? Either way we need to consider the future of the existing exiprationDate and lotNumber elements. These are long standing elements in Immunization but are also part of Medication. If we add the option of referencing Medication, should we remove these elements from Immunization? If we do, that forces systems to use Medication (probably as a contained resource) if they want to document these concepts. Or can we leave them for systems to use if they don't want to create a Medication resource? Any opinions would be appreciated.</p>",

Sometimes what you know is just 'patient took the Pfizer vaccine\" and in that case you'd avoid the need for a resource. I think that is one of the reasons for the existence of CodeableReference.</p>",
