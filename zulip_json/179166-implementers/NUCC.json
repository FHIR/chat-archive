To be clear, <strong>there is no expectation that a code system or a value set canonical url will resolve to anything.</strong> The whole <em>it's nice when it does</em> result makes you think that you can find the content at the canonical endpoint, and that is rare in the real world but (unfortunately for training all users on this point) is very common here inside the FHIR publisher space.</p>",
