I'm starting the process of researching how I can possibly use FHIR for my SaaS that's running on Azure.</p>\n<p>My product is not in the EHR space, rather case management, so there is some cross over with patients/clients, etc. My goal is to get my product into EMR app stores such as Epic, Cerner, and Athena. I would like to match up clients with patients and then ultimately pass in PDF notes to the EHR record as an attachment.</p>\n<p>That's the goal in a nutshell but from here, i'm not sure what to research first. Has anyone done this before? I am looking for articles, direction and other information on what to do next.</p>\n<p>Hope this makes sense.</p>",
