I've seen different FHIR servers define a default value and the standard way to override this is to use the _count option on the search request.   However, I believe it's a \"server implementation decision\" on what it supports for &lt;FHIR server max&gt;.    The way to deal with this is to use the link next property to page through the result set.</p>\n<p>BTW, the <a href=\"https://github.com/Vermonster/fhir-kit-client\">fhir-kit-client</a> has \"Pagination support for search results\" that might be helpful if you use JavaScript/TypeScript/node.js.</p>",
