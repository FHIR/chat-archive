I couldn't find a way to represent this without defining a new extension, or via an encounter (which seems wrong to me). This is useful in community health worker scenarios where patient home locations are used for planning home visits.<br>\n2) is there a linkage between a \"Group\" of \"Practitioners\" and \"Healthcare Service\"? Again this is useful for identifying a group of health workers who cover an area (\"coverageArea\" field in \"Healthcare Service\").<br>\nThanks!</p>",

So we would have Practitioners in Groups under Organization with an OrganizationAffliation to a parent Organization. And that OrganizationAffliation has a reference to the HealthcareService which has a Location?... This seems like a quite a lot.. maybe a much easier way is just to add the geolocation extension to the group of practitioners.</p>",
