In this case the identifier is sliced, one identifier is conditionally required, the other is open to the application. So to distinguish between the two I would like to add a requirement that the conditionally required element, when present, has an id of a specific value. But I see no way in the Forge tool to indicate what that id is. Anyone know how to do that?  Thanks</p>",

Its sole purpose is to allow elements to be referenced from elsewhere in an instance.  So it really doesn't make sense to use as a discriminator.  For Identifier, your discriminator would ususally be Identifier.use, Identifier.type or Identifier.system (or less commonly the existence of Identifier.period.end).
