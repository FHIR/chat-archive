However, in the scenario I am evaluated, a provider documents a diagnosis without entering an onset or end time. Therefore, in the condition FHIR resource, there is only an asserted date, onset and abatement are not populated. In this scenario, is it recommended, or do other implementers, populate this condition.asserteddate as the diagnosis abatement date in QDM?</p>",
