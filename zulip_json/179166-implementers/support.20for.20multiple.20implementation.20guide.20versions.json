But it is essential that time to time a new version can be published.</p>\n<p>Let's assume that changes in IG are breaking and we don't want to force external 3-rd party applications to migrate on the newest version.<br>\nSo the question - how can we introduce supporting of two versions for IGs? What is the best practice over the industry?</p>",

In this case, I have to differentiate what exactly I'm calling IG v1 or IG v2. There are multiple options in FHIR protocol, for instance, we can specify a profile name for each version of IG. But it is very strange.</p>",
