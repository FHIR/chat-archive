Can the $everything operation on the patient be invoked to return de-idenified data sometimes and identified data other times or is there an expectation that it is always identified ?<br>\n2. Can $everything be used across the system to return data for all patients who have consented to share their information for research (or other purposes) ?</p>\n<p>Thanks<br>\nDragon</p>",
