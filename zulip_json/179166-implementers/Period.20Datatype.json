The context of use will specify whether the entire range applies (e.g. \"the patient was an inpatient of the hospital for this time range\") or one value from the period applies (e.g. \"give to the patient between 2 and 4 pm on 24-Jun 2013\").\"</p>\n<p>The examples of this are all concerning date only values. Is this rule intended to apply to datetime intervals as well, i.e. a period from 10 am to 11 am should by 10:00 to 10:59 given that the granularity in this example is minutes (because 10:59 is inclusive)?</p>\n<p>I do understand why the specification says both inclusive for dates, as this is what the end users would think, but for time it is less intuitive. On the other hand, different rules for different granularities is also confusing.</p>\n<p>What is the correct interpretation of the specification?</p>",
