We only create distinct resources when we're confident that the division is something most systems will have an easy time managing, when it refects how systems think of and access data and that each concept is generally distinctly identifiable and has its own state.

Agree that there should be less of a priority on pretty models than practicality, but maybe there's a slight disconnect between how 'systems think of and access data' and the way humans - especially lay folks like myself - identify, classify and associate those concepts independent of electronic systems.  </p>\n<p>I am using a model called Q6 that uses universal classes (see article here: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/finding-universals-enterprise-information-management-john-o-gorman\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/finding-universals-enterprise-information-management-john-o-gorman\">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/finding-universals-enterprise-information-management-john-o-gorman</a> ) that treats all medical terminology and entities as identifiable resources.  The idea is to get any medically-related terminology working with any other potentially overlapping data set using common classification and identity protocols.</p>\n<p>A final apology for the self-promotion, but I am keenly interested in initiatives like FHIR - especially if they can reduce the amount of time practitioners spend entering - and re-entering data. </p>\n<p>Thanks again for your responses.

Since clinics don't necessarily have unique names, this may need to be a combination of name and address. But I hear your point, and translate it as -- use name and address as 2 separate required search parameters to uniquely identify a clinic, rather than forcing applications to use an identifier that concatenates name and address  </p>",
