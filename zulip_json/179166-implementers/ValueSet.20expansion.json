Does the content in the expansion differ if the codes we all LOINC or SNOMED or a mixture? Are there any guidelines on how to appropriately expand a ValueSet based on the input parameters? Would it matter based on a particular clinical domain?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",

I assume you may have seen it, but the way that the $expand operation is intended to work is documented <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset.html#expansion\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset.html#expansion\">here</a>.  I think that should answer your questions at least in regard to the general approach, but if there are details that still aren't clear or are confusing we can certainly talk about that further - and that might indicate that there's some missing documentation that we can add.  As Yunwei said, the servers do some discretion in regard to support for input parameters (which should ideally be documented in the capability statement  - including TerminologyCapabilities where appropriate).  But all servers should be following the basic algorithm documented in the link above.</p>",

I am jostling with the reasoning for the expansionprofile and then the move to standard parameters if we needes to profile expansions the. How can we use parametera in a standardized way? But as Yunwei mentioned it is the terminology server that determines these or have I misunderstood?</p>",

So even if you are working with servers that are on STU3 (where it still exists in the specification) I'm not sure if any of the servers (other than possibly Grahame's) did much with ExpansionProfile, and even if they did it's likely best to generally ignore and not use it at this point.  Maybe you can clarify a bit more what you are thinking of specifically in regard to your question about how to \"use parameters in a standardized way\"?  Obviously the parameters should be used in a standardized way, so if it appears that is not the case then that needs to be clarified (or corrected).</p>",
