For example, if the patient has a history of syncope (fainting) when having blood work done, the precaution could be syncope, fear of needles.\" in our source system. We are able to select a broad concept (like BMI, Splenectomy), specific drug or freetext. </p>\n<p>Right now, I'm looking at the RiskAssessment and AllergyIntolerance as the main canidate resources. Wondering what would be the best resource(s)?</p>",
