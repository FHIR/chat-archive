        "content": "<p>I would agree with Rene, but also add a clarification. \"It depends on what you are using AuditEvent for...\"  If using it for Privacy or Security, then yes it is best to do redundant records by EVERY actor and possibly many layers within each actor. You do this redundant records primarily for Security analysis, that analysis will do broad traffic analysis looking for unusual patterns. That is, a system is watching the log at all times to understand usual patterns, thus it can tell when the server records an event but there is not redundant record by a client which seems odd and might nothing but might also indicate malicious actions.<br>\nBut if you are using AuditEvent simply to record events for workflow efficiency analysis (like IHE SOLE profile), then one usually has a well defined actor that is defined to record each unique event. In this use-case one is looking for delta-time between events to find inefficiency, or things that happen out of order. Thus redundant records are not helpful.</p>",
