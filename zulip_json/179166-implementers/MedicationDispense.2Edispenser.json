However, I found another tracker (<a href=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=12831\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=12831\">GF#12831</a>) that subsequently removed performer.role.  That second tracker was logged Feb 15 and references a Zulip discussion, which I assume was <a href=\"https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/implementers/topic/Workflow.20pattern\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/implementers/topic/Workflow.20pattern\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/implementers/topic/Workflow.20pattern</a>.  I wasn't on the Pharmacy call Feb 22 when that tracker was discussed, but I'm just guessing it may have stemmed from a related email sent to the listserv (<a href=\"http://lists.hl7.org/read/messages?id=308629\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://lists.hl7.org/read/messages?id=308629\">http://lists.hl7.org/read/messages?id=308629</a>) when you suggested \"Pharmacy should consider removing type, or making a medications specific list\".</p>",
