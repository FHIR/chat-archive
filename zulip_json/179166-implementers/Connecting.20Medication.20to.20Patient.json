There is no reference in the document. How can I fetch Medication against the Patient?<br>\nI am using PatientEverything API for fetching all the resources against the patient.<br>\nCan you please help me for the same as soon as possible because I am stuck in that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This sounds like a question well suited on the implementer stream. The short answer is that Medication connects to Patient  through MedicationRequest, MedicationDispense, MedicationAdministration and/or MedicationStatement, never directly. Medication is the description of a drug regardless of a patient or doctor.</p>\n<p>The question \"what's the medication list for this patient\" is thus answered by looking at what a Patient <em>should</em> be using based on MedicationRequest, what he <em>could</em> be using based on MedicationDispense, what he <em>definitively has</em> been using based on MedicationAdministration and what is <em>stated</em> he uses based on MedicationStatement.</p>",
