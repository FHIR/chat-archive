But looking into the FHIR resources I can't find any obvious way to model that. I do understand that FHIR resources can be arbitrarily bundled together, but the link between an appointment and an episode of care is something I would expect to be formally modelled by some kind of attribute/reference on the appointment. </p>\n<p>So... is there something I've missed? Or is my understanding simplistic and there's other resources that should be involved in capturing the relationship between an Appointment and an EpisodeOfCare? Thanks!</p>",
