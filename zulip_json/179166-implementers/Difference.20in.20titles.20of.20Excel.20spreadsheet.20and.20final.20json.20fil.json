I was just wondering if  there are plans to align the two or if there is a document somewhere that indicates these links?<br>\nThanks in advance.</p>",

As the StructureDefinition resource evolves, it's much less work to update the extract code than it is to update all of the spreadsheets.  I don't think there's any plans to increase consistency.  And there is an intention to retire the use of spreadsheets for anything other than resource definition.  That doesn't mean it couldn't happen, just that it's not terribly high priority</p>",
