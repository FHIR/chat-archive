Should there also be a constraint saying that the contained resource has an <code>id</code> if it doesn't reference the containing resource? (Does one of the constraints already contain this logic? From what I can tell there isn't any, but I could be reading them incorrectly.)</p>\n<p>Thank you,<br>\nPreston</p>",

It seems like there are two distinct concerns here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is a bug in the fhirpath expression for <code>dom-3</code> that allows it to be satisfied even if there are no references between the containing and contained resource: if the contained resource has no <code>id</code> then this empty value is propagated through the fhirpath expression by the <code>+</code>, <code>in</code>, and <code>or</code> operators. This results in <code>contained.where({}).empty()</code>, which is true (regardless of whether or not there are any references).</li>\n<li>Should all <code>contained</code> resources be required to have an <code>id</code>? The answer from above seems to be \"yes\", but I don't think this is suggested by any of the existing constraints so a new constraint should be added.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Are both of these being addressed, or should I file another ticket for one ofthem?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
