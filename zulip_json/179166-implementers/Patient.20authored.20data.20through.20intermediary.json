TRSLT (you probably meant: MAPPED, which is a better fit IMHO) would make sense if translating <em>to</em> FHIR, but the other way around it doesn't come into play at all. <br>\nAlexanders question is about how one instructs the receiving side to \"go translate this, en route to designated receiver\". In my mind that's an operation (e.g. \"TranslateToEdifactAndRoute\") with as input parameters a bundle of resources, a referenced sending resource, a referenced recieving resource, as well as some other stuff. </p>",
