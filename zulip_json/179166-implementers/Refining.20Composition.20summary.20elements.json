The list in task means that the following elements won't be summary elements that aren't now, and for which I think that's wrong:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Composition.class</li>\n<li>Composition.encounter</li>\n<li>Composition.date</li>\n<li>Composition.title</li>\n<li>Composition.relatesTo / .relatesTo.code</li>\n<li>Composition.event.period</li>\n</ul>\n<p>but actually, reviewing the disposition leaves me confused, since it doesn't say which resource it's about but it talks about DocumentReference elements even though the task says it's about Composition elements.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191505\">@Sean McIlvenna</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192205\">@Lisa Nelson</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191407\">@Rick Geimer</span></p>",

But seems the rational for Composition should be very different than the rational for DocumentReference. I would agree that this disposition seems to be the one from DocumentReference.  Should this would be in th approved state, or that which needs discussion leading to a vote?</p>",

Feb 1st feels like forever ago. my memory tells me we were focused on changing Composition's summary fields. But, reading the resolution and details makes me question that. I'll bring this ticket up on tomorrow's SD call (which I believe <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192205\">@Lisa Nelson</span> is planning to attend) and see if I can get some better notes about it.</p>",
