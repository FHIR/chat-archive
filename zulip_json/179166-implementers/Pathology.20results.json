The current message contains a header, then for each patient for a given Practice the results per patient (there may be multiple results per patients depending on what has been ordered). In FHIR I was looking at a Bundle, MessageHeader with the MessageHeader.focus pointing out to DiagnosticReports per patient (with Patient details, Observations &amp; Specimen details hanging off each DiagnosticReport). Does this sound like  a reasonable approach? or should the MessageHeader.focus point to the Patient records (that then point to the DiagnosticReports etc.)?</p>",
