Would it be more beneficial to just name all instances as \"subject\" and just reference restrict it to Patient (with the possibility of expand ability later)?  Maybe have it generic in all Resources as I would say 90% of all Resources pertain to a subject. (i.e. Condition/Encounter as patient, CarePlan/Observation as subject)</p>",
