Distributed systems amend the same patient's medication treatment, but cannot and may not manipulate instances on other servers. Instead they make new MedicationRequest instances reflecting the agreement between practitioner/patient. So, in our design, we always create a new instance with a new discrete business identifier (and logical id of course).

Maybe the opposition to a reason for status 'active' grounds there: the real/underlying reason for the existence of any active MedicationRequest is that you are treating some disorder.
