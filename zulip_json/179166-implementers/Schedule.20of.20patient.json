I see the the 'Schedule' resource allows to be linked to the Patient via the .actor reference, is that the way to go? Ideally though I would like something like the .availableTime and .notAvailable that we find in PractitionerRole but I guess it is a bit of a stretch to use that for a Patient. Any input is most welcome.</p>",
