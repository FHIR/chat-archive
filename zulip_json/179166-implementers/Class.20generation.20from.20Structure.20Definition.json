Since a structure definition describes the structure of a FHIR resource, it could we valuable as a reference for an application to describe a data object.</p>",

The documentation is a bit spare, documentation in the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/structuredefinition.html#logical\">spec</a> , e.g. the CDA standard has been described as a <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/CDA-core-2.0/\">logical model</a> and in the profiling academy of simplifier you find more <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/guide/profilingacademy/Logicalmodels\">information</a></p>",

That project takes the core specs (WIP for IGs - they are a bit messier), normalizes them, and passes them via an interface to an exporter that can export class structures, etc..</p>\n<p>Is that what you are looking for?</p>",
