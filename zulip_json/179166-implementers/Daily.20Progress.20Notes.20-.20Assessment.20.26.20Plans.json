        "content": "<p>This is a difficult question -- we spent a lot of time in Argonaut project discussing 'how a client will find' all the clinical notes for a patient. After circling round/round we always came back to the idea that many notes will HAVE to be indexed by DocumentReference. For example, you could have a scanned 'progress note', a 'C-CDA progress note', or even a 'Composition Progress Note'. Rather than invent some complex guidance to say query this resource for this note type, or this for another, we settled on DocumentReference as an indexer for all.

I think that you and Grahame still don't like to consider Composition for this purpose, Lloyd, but clinically I think it can make sense, particularly for more complex and structured notes, and as Brett noted it is an option (likely indexed by DocumentReference, as he said).</p>",
