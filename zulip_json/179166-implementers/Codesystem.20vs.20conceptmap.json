Those hospitals requires to send us data via those consumers. None of them have FHIR based codesystem. I’m planing to create codesystems defined in my FHIR server for each of those hospitals and then create a concept map for each of them to my codesystem. Perhaps for gender, we have have 10 gender codesystem, each belong to a hospital and one which is mine. So 10 code system and mine (11) and one concept map for all together Mapped to mine. I will then use this conceptmap to map the values before it’s written to downstream systems and ingested. Would you see a fault or perhaps anti pattern  in this design ? <br>\n<strong> I’m just taking advantage of having a subject expert matter and to check my designs</strong>* <br>\nAppreciate your insights there</p>",

A lot depends on what these downstream systems and the subsequent use is going to be.</p>",
