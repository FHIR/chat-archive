Some Locations and Organizations have multiple different phone numbers for different business purposes. For example, they might have one for billing inquiries, one for general appointment scheduling, and another one specifically for vaccine appointment scheduling. I don't see a good way to model that today.<br>\nI suppose it would be possible to create multiple child Organization resources within a larger parent and then use the Organization.contact.purpose element. But that seems kind of messy.</p>",
