It seems that such a statement follows automatically from a MedicationRequest/-Dispense resources (supposing they have a appropriate status values) - an fresh prescription implies that the patient should be taking the prescribed medication in the future etc.. That, in turn, would mean that one could automatically generate MedicationStatements from (certain) MedicationRequest/-Dispense instances.</p>\n<p>Specifically, suppose I have a MedicationRequest with the following properties (something similar would work with MedicationDispense):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>status</code> =  \"active\" (or \"completed\")</li>\n<li><code>intent</code> = \"order\"</li>\n<li><code>requester</code> = Doctor X</li>\n<li><code>authoredOn</code> =  date D </li>\n<li><code>medication</code> =  medication M</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then it seems one can automatically derive a MediationStatement/-Usage with the following properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>status</code> = \"intended\"</li>\n<li><code>basedOn</code> = [medication request above]</li>\n<li><code>dateAsserted</code> =  date D</li>\n<li><code>informationSource</code> = Doctor X</li>\n<li><code>medication</code> = medication M</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Would this be considered legitimate or would such a conversion violate the semantics of the involved resources? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191405\">@Rob Hausam</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"193991\">@Christof Gessner</span> I am curious if there has been explicit discussion of this in the community of IPS implementers, given that the IPS IG explicitly acknowledges that the IPS medication summary can be build from prescription or dispense lists.</p>",
