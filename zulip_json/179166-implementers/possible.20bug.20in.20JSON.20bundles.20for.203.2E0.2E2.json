Specifically, I'm seeing three occasions where, instead of single quotes, the file includes <code>#39;.</code>. For example, in profiles-resources.json, in the definition of StructureDefinition, constraint sdf-8 appears as <code>                  \"expression\": \"(%resource.kind = #39;.logical#39;. or element.first().path = %resource.type) and element.tail().all(path.startsWith(%resource.snapshot.element.first().path&amp;'.'))\",\n</code><br>\nIts not like that in the individual JSON linked through the web page, only in the bundled JSON. Its causing us issues parsing the bundles to load the resources into our server</p>",
