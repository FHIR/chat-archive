In earlier builds, Unicode characters were encoded... properly?  E.g., in 4.0.1 (current R4) and 4.1.0 (R4B ballot) we have \"Polish złoty\", \"Paraguayan guaraní\", etc.  However, in the snapshots (both R4B and R5) I'm seeing \"Polish zE\\u0002oty\", \"Paraguayan guaranC-\", etc.</p>\n<p>Looking at <code>...publish\\expansions.json</code> on my local builds, they look 'incorrect' there already (recent R4B and R5), but I don't know how that is sourced.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts or pointers would be greatly appreciated.  (tagging <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> since it's probably in your wheelhouse, but I will also apologize since I know you've had quite a day already)</p>",
