In HL7 FHIR search page we can't find these 2 modifiers for token types. Based on the description in the search page, by token parameters must be done close to the exact-match searches. Meanwhile seems I understand your motivation for doing so.<br>\nBut shouldn't we either use string parameters for these searches with exact and contains modifiers or token parameters without exact and contains modifiers?</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"215604\">@Saul Kravitz</span></p>",
