But yes, Genomics Reporting is now the target for all changes.  The IG automatically builds, though the URL is different.  (I'll change the source from the old one to point people to the current one).  Looks like there's a problem with the auto-publish though - <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/</a> doesn't look right.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191315\">@Josh Mandel</span> - is there a step I missed?</p>",
