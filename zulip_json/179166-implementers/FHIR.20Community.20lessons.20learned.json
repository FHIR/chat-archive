Just to give a few examples:<br>\n-Have a Zulip for HL7v2 and/or CDA implementers (based on the success of this forum)<br>\n-Create implementation oriented bundles for the v2 and CDA specifications (include APIs, software processable specifications, plenty of valid examples, etc. - as FHIR does it). See <a href=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Implementation_Packages\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Implementation_Packages\">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Implementation_Packages</a> , this has been discussed in the past as well.</p>\n<p>Anything else? That's where you come in: what 'FHIR lesson learned' would be nice to apply to HL7v2 and CDA, to make it easier to implement those HL7 standards ?</p>",
