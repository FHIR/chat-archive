However, how do existing EHR workflows capture that an appointment is virtual within the clinical workflow? Is is entirely as an appointment or is there some flag on the clinical encounter that can be mapped to \"VR\" for subsequent use in Encounter.class, or Appointment?  It seems there two workflows - a clinical process and a subsequent claim process (claim capturing the nature of the visit as part of the ICD-10 <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/VYFd03UvKQITqkAPbULQG-sg/image.png\">image.png</a> Claim.procedure.procedure_x_ . Any help on describing the process is appreciated.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/VYFd03UvKQITqkAPbULQG-sg/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/VYFd03UvKQITqkAPbULQG-sg/image.png\"></a></div>",
