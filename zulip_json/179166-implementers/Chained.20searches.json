(contrived examples for <code>Observation</code>: <code>patient._has:Condition:subject:identifier=myid</code>, <code>_has:Procedure:part-of:patient.active=true</code></p>\n<p>2) can a (possibly reverse) chained search specify multiple restrictions on one join?  eg search for all patients with an <code>Appointment</code> with status <code>booked</code> today, or all patients with an active <code>EpisodeOfCare</code> for a particular<code>Organization</code> (I'm assuming that <code>_has:EpisodeOfCare:patient:identifier=myid&amp;_has:EpisodeOfCare:patient:active=true</code> does two separate joins, is this correct?)</p>\n<p>3) taking 2) a bit further, can I specify conditions along the join path, eg all patients with an active <code>EpisodeOfCare</code> for an <code>Organization</code> whose name matches 'foo'?</p>",
