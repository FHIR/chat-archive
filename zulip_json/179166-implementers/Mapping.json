For those of you, who is interested in new ideas on how to express the mapping logic between FHIR and other systems, Iâ€™ve set up a repository containing a demonstration of JUTE language, which we're using internally at Health Samurai. This repository contains an example of HL7 v2 to FHIR Bundle mapping, and translation of the Mapping Language tutorial from FHIR documentation.</p>\n<p>The repository is available here: <a href=\"https://github.com/HealthSamurai/jute-example\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/HealthSamurai/jute-example\">https://github.com/HealthSamurai/jute-example</a></p>\n<p>Examples are executable, so you can play with language in your terminal.</p>\n<p>For today, the language itself is represented mostly as a reference implementation, and it has no documentation at all, but we will invest our time in documenting it, if there is sufficient interest from community. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.</p>",
