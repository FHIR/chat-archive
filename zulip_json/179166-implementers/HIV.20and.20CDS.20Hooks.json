I am new to FHIR but I was able to learn and to create <br>\na patient with condition, and I am able to view the patient information all in my Java FHIR codes. I plan to create a web site and plan to call my FHIR API to display patient information. However, my teacher just told me that I need to implement a CDSHooks. Since I am new CDSHooks, do I need a CDSHooks in order to call my FHIR API and display information from FHIR API to the web site?<br>\nThanks.</p>",
