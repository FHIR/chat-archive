And it is pointed at by the extensions defined (scoped by fullUrl, if necessary). </p>\n<p>So it doesn't make sense for this id to be the id of something else, such as a resource.</p>\n<p>The extensions say: \"this thing I'm extending is what the referenced thing's text (having that id) is about\".</p>\n<p>But it seems those extensions can go on the whole resource (they say \"A human language representation of the concept (<em>resource</em>/element)\") so that it seems that that would give me what I need.</p>",
