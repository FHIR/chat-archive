If it <em>did</em> fail, you can't necessarily count on a consistent error code.  Different software may detect the issue in different ways.  For some, it may trigger an internal null-pointer error or some other internal failure that may be completely unclear as to cause.  Ideally, the error could SHOULD be not-found or deleted.  But it might be business-rule, exception, processing, transient or maybe something else.</p>",
