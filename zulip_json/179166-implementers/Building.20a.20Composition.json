It seems to us that a Composition needs to be manually generated about a subject by an author, or have a known structure (e.g. International Patient Summary [IPS], electronic Case Reporting [eCR]) that can be queried for from known servers. This assumes that the resources already exist on a FHIR server, and that FHIR server is known to the actor creating the Composition for the Document Bundle. The manual creation of the Composition makes sense, but how do you tackle the dependencies for creating the information if you wanted to automatically create the Composition? Would you have to do a search for the available Resources first on the endpoint (e.g. exiting Patient, Condition, Procedure)? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"193795\">@Joel Francis</span></p>",
