ElementDefinition.condition allows children of the element that has the constraint to indicate that they're impacted by the constraint.  For example, if you put a constraint on the Patient node saying \"there must either be a name or birthDate\", you would put a condition on the name and birthDate elements that points back to the constraint as a flag that says \"there are special rules about whether I'm allowed to/must appear\"</p>",
