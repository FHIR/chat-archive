I'd think performance status would be a clinical impression (performance status = clinician's impression/assessment of pts ability to carry on normal tasks/etc.), but the Apgar note suggests intent of ClinicalImpression may be capturing items outside tools/specific scales, even with inclusion of codeable concepts.</p>\n<p>Or maybe it can be in either, and there's no set determination yet?<br>\nMore re: performance status measures (ECOG, Karnofsky, Lansky, Zubrod; see \"Relationships\" tab for info re: individual scales):<br>\nURL: <a href=\"https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI_Thesaurus&amp;version=16.09d&amp;ns=NCI_Thesaurus&amp;code=C20641\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI_Thesaurus&amp;version=16.09d&amp;ns=NCI_Thesaurus&amp;code=C20641\">https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI_Thesaurus&amp;version=16.09d&amp;ns=NCI_Thesaurus&amp;code=C20641</a></p>",

Seems to suggest that any scale, regardless of subjectivity, is an \"observation.\" What matters is that the scale/tool has distinct codeable categories, not whether the scale is based on relatively-specific numbers v. based on underlying clinical impressions/assessments.</p>",
