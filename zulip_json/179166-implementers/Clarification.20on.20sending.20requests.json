My goal is just to send the practioner's email as well as the patient's mrn. I'm currently sending: <br>\n{<br>\n    \"Hook\": \"patient-view\",<br>\n    \"HookInstance\": \"1234\",<br>\n    \"Context\": {<br>\n        \"email\": \"<a href=\"mailto:test@test.com\" title=\"mailto:test@test.com\">test@test.com</a>\",<br>\n        \"mrn\": \"9999999\"<br>\n    }<br>\n}<br>\nSo my questions are:<br>\nDoes the prefetch field work by using data in the context? Does the context field get its values from the prefetch? or are they both prepopulated<br>\nHow can I check if the ContactType in the practitioner field is type email before getting the value?<br>\nWhat form should my post request look like in addition to what I have?</p>\n<p>Any help is appreciated, thank you!</p>",
