As a result..we are getting conflicts with already existing Apache-Lucene version 4.10.1 used in ourapplication. Will FHIR works if I replace 5.3.1 with 4.10.1 verson for Apache-Lucene. Any thoughts would HELP!! Thank you</p>",

You might have an easier time if you create an application using HAPI and use a build manager to figure out dependency versions. If you do get it working with the CLI, great though. Nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<p>Either way, Lucene is only used for 2 things: fulltext searching, and (as of 1.6 which isn't released yet) terminology services. The next version of the CLI (1.6) will have a <code>--lowmem</code> option which disables Lucene support entirely in HAPI so that would probably resolve this.</p>",
