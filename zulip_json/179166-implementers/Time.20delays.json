Whether or not the FHIR server can handle this becomes a question of the scaling of the FHIR server's resources, e.g. CPU speed/allocation (on cloud), RAM, DB performance, network bandwidth, etc.   So your question seems to become a one of analyzing the performance capabilities of the FHIR server you use (or are intending to use).    It would probably be helpful to run some performance tests on your chosen FHIR server and collecting metrics to see how it handles increasingly higher loads, e.g. more FHIR message posts per minute.  If you are using a cloud-based FHIR server it probably supports scaling in CPU/RAM/Disk speed as well as dynamic scaling of services to handle more requests.</p>",

        "content": "<p>True, many other industries have scaled to support high (millions/sec) http REST transaction rates.  However, I suspect many FHIR implementations have been focused on the typical loads of EHR data, e.g. maybe 10s of Labs/patient/day, 100s vital signs/patient/day, 5 orders/patient/day, etc. a much smaller transaction load than medical device data.   For example, I know of patient monitoring data feeds that can send in vital sign data of 5-10 elements (FHIR Observations) every 30 seconds per patient/per bed.   In a typical critical care unit there tend to be at least 10 patients (beds) producing this high frequency data.   I don't believe (m)any FHIR severs have been brought to bear to address this transaction demand.</p>\n<p>Wasn't there a FHIR effort to look into FHIR at scale?   Ah, yes, the ONC \"FHIR at Scale Taskforce\" although I'm not sure this effort is about 'input data scaling' but scaling across multiple FHIR servers (national/regional FHIR aggregation needs)?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://oncprojectracking.healthit.gov/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=43614268\">https://oncprojectracking.healthit.gov/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=43614268</a></p>",
