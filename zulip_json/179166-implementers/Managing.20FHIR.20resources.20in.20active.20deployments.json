The following use case might give some context:<br>\nUsing the hapi server and keycloak as the building blocks, If I want to build an application that helps State governments manage Antenatal care, I can imagine a lot of FHIR resources being used to represent real world entities. Below are a few examples using the following convention : </p>\n<p><strong>Real world entity -&gt;  Fhir Resource -&gt; Keycloak object</strong> </p>\n<p>Clinic -&gt; Organization -&gt; Group in keycloak <br>\nHCW -&gt;  Practitioner -&gt; User in keycloak<br>\nSurvey -&gt; Questionnaire -&gt; Null</p>\n<p>When the deployment starts, there may be some data shared by the State in csv files that need to be converted to fhir resource / Keycloak objects.  During the course of the deployment, there will be changes that need to be made to these fhir resource eg: A survey may need to be modified / an organization may need to be changed etc.</p>\n<p>What are some of the usual patterns that implmenters follow to build such functionality? Do you have web apps that manage this and are handed over to state workers?  Is this webapp an extension of the FHIR server  or is it a separate thing? </p>\n<p>Apologies if this question is too general. Any link or references to active deployments / open source designs will also help.</p>",
