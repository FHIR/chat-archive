(assume a FHIR document with coded statements)<br>\nThe use case is that a patient is admitted to hospital and their dose of Ramipril is changed from 5mg to 10mg. They are started on Warfarin and told to keep taking their current dose of Lisinopril. The hospital needs to let the General Practitioner know about the change.<br>\nIs it as simple as a series of MedicationStatements<br>\n1. a status of \"stop\" on Ramipril 5mg<br>\n2. a status of \"active\" on Ramipril 10mg<br>\n3. a status of \"active\" on Warfarin <br>\n4. a status of \"active\"on Lisinopril (with the original effective date) ?<br>\nOR should I use a Flag resource to Flag the 5mg Ramipril as being stopped, the 10mg Ramipril Warfarin as added &amp; Lisinopril as continued?<br>\nWhich option would make the reconciliation easier for the recipient?</p>",
