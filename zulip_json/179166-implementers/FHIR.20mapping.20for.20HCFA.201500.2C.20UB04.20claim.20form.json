Near the top of that resource is a little banner that indicates the work group responsible for that resource.  If you click on that link, it'll take you to the work group's home page.  Included there is a list of upcoming conference calls.  It also indicates what list serve(s) exist where agendas would be posted - if the work group is in the habbit of posting agendas.</p>",
