I do understand that subscriptions are based on searches and as such cannot show anything which no longer matches after an update/delete.

I'd imagine that systems would like to know about deletes hence this seems like an oversight to me prompting my question about the reasoning behind it.</p>\n<p>Also technically speaking a deleted patient is still a patient, as such couldn't a subscription for resource_type = Patient still list it? Or is the assumption really that a deletion removes everything (which is obviously not the case since the history for that resource and id is still there).</p>\n<p>Sorry if my questions appear to be annoying, I am trying to grasp the concepts and ideas to give me a better understanding.</p>",
