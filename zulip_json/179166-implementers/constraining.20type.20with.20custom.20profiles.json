In the type definitions of References I am looking for a way to to constrain the references to a set of my own custom profiles. I have seen in the StructureDefinitions of the official profiles that the type constraining is done by using a targetProfile-tag containing the URL of the allowed profiles. But in my case I do not yet have valid URLs that could be used. Or do I have to construct similar URLs describing my custom profiles to accomplish my task ?</p>",
