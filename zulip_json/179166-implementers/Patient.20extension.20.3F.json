Many patient characteristics can be represented with Observation while  problems and conditions are handled by Condition.  Regarding the extension there is a standard  <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/extension-birthplace.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/extension-birthplace.html\">birthplace extension</a> in FHIR and I think a deathplace extension is perfectly appropriate.
