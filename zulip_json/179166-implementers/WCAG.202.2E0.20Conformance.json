The IG publisher does provide a large number of fragments to make the page out of, so the deeper answer is that you may or may not be able to put together a page that meets WCAG guidelines using that text</p>\n<p>I've kept that text as linear and simple as I can - and that's partly for WCAG purposes, but I haven't explicitly checked that. But things like table presentation forms, or the XML templates.... those are inherently not very accessible. </p>\n<p>So this means: I am interested in someone trying this out and reporting issues as they are discovered. We'll take them seriously, but we can't guarantee happy outcomes</p>",
