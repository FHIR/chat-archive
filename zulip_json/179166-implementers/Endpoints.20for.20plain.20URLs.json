It seems that <code>connectionType</code>and <code>payloadType</code> are required, but the associated value sets don't contain null values for non-FHIRized urls.  It would be nice to be able to associate a vanilla website/homepage with a Location, and the reference to Endpoint almost satisfies that usecase.  </p>\n<p>Would the recommended approach be to put the URL in the <code>Location.endpoint.reference</code>?  In the <code>Location.meta</code> somewhere?  In the <code>Endpoint.address</code> but not specify the connectionType/payloadType?  Or create an adhoc system for connectionType/payloadType?  Or just go ahead and create falsy values for connectionType/payloadType?</p>",
