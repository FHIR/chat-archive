        "content": "<p>Just starting to look at the Flag resource as it is very relevant to one of our products (CAMS). I'll add more detail later but my first comment is about the language rather than the detailed content. We have a clear distinction in CAMS between Flags and Alerts. Flags are the patient attribute - i.e. Patient has MRSA, whereas the Alert is the warning that arises when an event makes that attribute relevant. So when a patient attends ER that MRSA Flag should cause an Alert to be raised - possibly a simple icon on the ER screen and/or an email to Infection Control. That separation of terms  has certainly helped the implementation at Mid-Yorks -any thoughts?</p>",

Maybe sounds a subtle distinction but a patient may have a number of flags and not all are significant to care all the time.</p>",
