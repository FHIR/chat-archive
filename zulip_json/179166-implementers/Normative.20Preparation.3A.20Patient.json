I wouldn't exactly call it production ready, and we've never found another app to exchange veterinary data with via REST API; but the FHIR resources handled the internal data modeling just fine; and we were able to exchange data via database to our other FHIR compliant apps (i.e. we loaded up the horses from the Derby Demo into our ProviderDirectory demo).</p>",
