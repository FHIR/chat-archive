The sports are used as information for scientific evaluations and are not directly related  to hospitalisation. Therefore, we believe that Condition is the wrong resource because only clinically relevant information should be stored there.</p>\n<p>As we try to achieve intraoperability of different hospitals, we would like to avoid extensions. Otherwise we have separate extensions for all hospitals with extra patient attributes.</p>\n<p>We have now read that observations can also be used for demographic characteristics. However, we fear that we are modelling something that does not belong here. Observations are intended to record measurements and subjective points in time assasments. And we think this information isn't a measurement or an assasment.</p>\n<p>Would it be better to create a new profile for a basic resource in this case.</p>",
