We seem to have found a need to have multiple actors on a schedule. We believe that a schedule should be constrained to a combination of resources rather than individual actors. An example, an app developer queries schedule by type, let’s say the type is surgery, there are potentially 4 schedules returned: location A, location B, provider A, and provider B. Everything has availabilities from 9-10, but provider A only practices at location A and provider B only practices at location B. A consumer doesn’t know how to marry those 2 pieces of information together. As we though through it, we felt loosening the cardinality on actor on schedule would give the consumer more context on how to schedule an appointment. Thoughts on the above problem? Does practitioner role become part of scheduling workflows? We noticed practitioner role has the ability convey available day/time.</p>",
