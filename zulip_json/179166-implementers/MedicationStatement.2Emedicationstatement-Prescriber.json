In R4 this extension was removed so we are currently failing the base FHIR validation.  At first I thought it made sense to move this data to MedicationStatement.informationSource but now I don't think that is accurate.  </p>\n<p>In order to retain the data that was in medicationstatement-Prescriber will I just need to create a custom extension to replace it?  Is MedicationStatement.informationSource where this information should go?  Is there another alternative?</p>",
