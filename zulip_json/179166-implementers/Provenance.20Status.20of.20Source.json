It could be relevant to me to saven when the original resource was originally created or when it was modified at last, to save this information also to the fhir resource. <br>\nEverything that happens to the fhir-resource( creating, updating, transforming)  is part of the Provenance.  <br>\nAm I missing a thing to save this information?  <br>\nThe only thing i could imaging is using additional Meta.tag with an explicit coded timestamp.  Is there a \"defined\" way to do this?</p>",
