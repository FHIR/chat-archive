I agree to that. but it sounds like we can have our cake and eat it too then<br>\n[13-1-2016 20:43:00] Grahame Grieve: because if you are applying FHIRPath in the context where you have a type attribute instead of a pre-coordinated name, then .valueBoolean would be weird<br>\n[13-1-2016 20:43:20 | Edited 20:43:25] Grahame Grieve: so we could say that the base is .value.type(boolean) and in FHIR, you can do .valueBoolean<br>\n[13-1-2016 21:19:38] Ewout Kramer: \"However, this seems to be ambiguous in the grammar with the multiplication operator\"</p>\n<p>It's not really ambiguous because the multiplication requires a second operand, so either the bla* expression is followed by nothing (=path expression) or it's follow by another path (bla*bla =&gt; multiplication) or followed by an invocation (=&gt; path expression).
