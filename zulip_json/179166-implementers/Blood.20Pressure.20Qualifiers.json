        "content": "<p>Hi all,  the LOINC codes for different types of blood pressure qualifiers which are a combination of artery,  side , systolic or diastolic, body position (sitting, standing or lying) and method are not available. For example, LOINC code is displayed for 'Brachial artery - right systolic blood pressure' which is a combination of parameters artery+side+systolic. But, the method (whether it is palpation, doppler or by using sphygmomanometer) and body position are missing. I need the blood pressure qualifiers which includes all the parameters artery+side+systolic or diastolic+body position+method. Kindly suggest a solution. Thank you</p>",
