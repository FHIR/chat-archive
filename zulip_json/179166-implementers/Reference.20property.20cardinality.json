In several cases, a resource defines a reference, and this is a good place to put, e.g., a practitioner name, but we have no Practitioner resource to supply. As we read the reference type, the uri is optional, and we can use it to display a name (or other literal field) in the 'display' without any requirement to provide a uri. But I have not seen examples of anyone else doing this. Is this a problem?</p>",
