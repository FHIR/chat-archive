I have found <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/fhir/clinicalreasoning-cds-on-fhir.html\">http://www.hl7.org/fhir/clinicalreasoning-cds-on-fhir.html</a> in R4 and <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/clinicalreasoning-cds-on-fhir.html#guidance-request\">http://build.fhir.org/clinicalreasoning-cds-on-fhir.html#guidance-request</a> in R5. The latter appears to use the PlanDefinition resource and CarePlan with RequestGroup as outputs of the $apply operation. Am I on the right track to understanding how ServiceDefinition$evaluate has been replaced in later FHIR versions and are there further links which could help me understand this? Also, could I be made aware of any working implementations of the CDS Hooks approach as it would aid my understanding to see a real life implementation against a relevant use case. I have found the CDS Hooks website url at <a href=\"https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/\">https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191594\">@Katie Wheatley</span>, yes, the ServiceDefinition resource was deprecated in favor of the CDS Hooks specification to define decision support interactions. The guidance you've found provides the overall framework for how a Clinical Reasoning implementation could be used in that context, but that's only one possible implementation approach. We have been using that implementation approach in several different projects. The <a href=\"https://github.com/cqframework/content-ig-walkthrough\">Content IG Walkthrough</a> provides an example of how all the pieces can be used together to implement a CDS Hooks service using Clinical Reasoning components to provide decision support in an EHR that supports CDS Hooks.</p>",
