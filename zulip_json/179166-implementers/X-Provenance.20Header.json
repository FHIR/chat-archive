When using the X-Header method, it would seem reasonable that a server generated AuditEvent would be just one log including both the creatino/update of the resource, and the creation of the x-header contained provenance. Thus there would be two AuditEvent.entity entries for the resource and Provenance.  This likely should be noted in FHIR core, so please create a change request to add this clarification.</p>",
