In my profile I have two types of Observation resources that need to be referenced in an Observation in certain cases. One is a what I call a CoincidentTimeStamp Observation and the second is an Observation that is pointed to when the measurement being mapped contains a source-handle-reference. So without discussing the nitty-gritty details of what these thing are, how should I do this?<br>\n1. Slice the related element into a  CoincidentTimeStampRelated, SourceHandleReferenceRelated, and applicationRelated  cases or<br>\n2. Simply state that when a CoincidentTimeStamp Observation needs to be referenced it goes here and likewise with any source handle reference observations.</p>\n<p>\"1\" appears cleaner and more concise but then I am somewhat at a loss as to a way of providing a discriminator.Proper use of discriminators in profiling is not always clear. THe Forge tool allows the use of the element id but I was told this is not good. However, it seems a great way of doing it because I would simply set the id to the name of the slice like coincidentTimeStampRelated. Thoughts from profiling experts?</p>",
