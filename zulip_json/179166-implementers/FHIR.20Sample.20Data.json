I'd love to be able to fetch even a single PDF or C-CDA from Synthetic Mass before we do the deep dive into setting up our own setup.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the ability to fetch thousands and thousands of synthetic documents has been a game changer, and really made possible getting some more advanced workflows set up.
