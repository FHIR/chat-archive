I was going through the documentation for R4, which is quite descriptive. There I found a public GIT repo with many IG sources: <br>\n<a href=\"https://fhir.github.io/auto-ig-builder/builds.html\">https://fhir.github.io/auto-ig-builder/builds.html</a> <br>\n1)  I do not see any from DSTU2, the lowest version I see is STU3. Is there any specific reason for that ?<br>\n2)  What is the purpose of having IG sources in this public GitHub repo for vendors who start using our services ? (except for another one like me to refer how to create IG and create CI builds) ? Why I ask is, if we publish the output HTML on a publicly accessible web server, is that enough or is having these in <a href=\"http://fhir.github.io\">fhir.github.io</a> is a must ?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance<br>\nJanaka</p>",
