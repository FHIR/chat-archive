My question about it (and other FHIR profile tools) is: \"Is there a way to view these profiles without using an online website like <a href=\"http://Simplifier.net\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Simplifier.net\">Simplifier.net</a>?\"  In other words, is there a stylesheet or similar for displaying these 'locally' or a tool that creates a document (e.g. PDF) from these profiles?</p>",
