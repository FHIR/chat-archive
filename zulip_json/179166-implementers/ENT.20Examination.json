Can I create seperate Observation profiles for right and left external ears,tympanic membrane and ear canal  respectively? Or can I create two Observation profiles for right and left ears, add the \"external ear\", \"tympanic membrane \" and \"ear canal \" to the Observation.bodySite? Which approach is preferable? Thank you</p>",

In terms of one profile vs. multiple, I suspect you can get away with a single profile that covers left and right.  Whether you need to create separate profiles for different aspects depends on whether the constraints are separate.</p>",
