If you change an an agenda item that's FHIR related, please update this wiki page (or let me know so I can)<br>\n- My assessment of FHIR-related is based on whether the agenda item contained the word \"FHIR\" or was about a topic or project that I definitely new was FHIR-related.  I suspect there are FHIR-related agenda items I might not have recognized and thus missed.  If you can double-check the entries for your work group, that'd be great.</p>",
