We intend to map (back-end configuration) what the user chose in the user interface to available identifier systems. But does fhir support searching with multiple identifier systems in a single query. Something like this: /Patient?identifier.value=123&amp;identifier.system=goodhealth.it,<a href=\"http://overlakehealth.it\">overlakehealth.it</a>. Can somebody please advise how to support this search in a valid and efficient way</p>",
