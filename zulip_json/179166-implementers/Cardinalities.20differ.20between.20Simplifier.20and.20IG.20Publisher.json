The first slice stems from the base profile <a href=\"user_uploads/10155/YSqcvt-Gd3zLfOOSfwbSKkfS/vitalsigns-bodyheight.xml\">vitalsigns-bodyheight.xml</a> and is defined with a cardinality of 1..1. The latter two are defined in the derived profile itself and should be optional. As such, they contain only <code>&lt;max value=\"1\"/&gt;</code> in the differential, and no lower bound.<br>\nWhen generating the snapshot, Forge/Simplifier and the IG Publisher disagree on the cardinality of these two additional slices. Simplifier renders them as 0..1, while the IG Publisher interprets them as 1..1<br>\nDoes anybody have an idea what's going on and more which of the two interpretations is correct?</p>\n<p>I also attached two other profiles to complete the chain of inheritance.
