During our working group discussions during May and June 2015, the concept of a \"fatal\" error was not mentioned. It’s not clear what fatal would be: A prerequisite that’s not met in the test script? A fatal error within the test engine? A fatal error in the test system? The current behavior expected of a test engine is to mark the overall test script execution as Failed if the setup or any of the tests fail.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>is there anyway to say 'just stop running the tests'?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The currently defined behavior (testing.html) of the test engine's processing of the TestScript regarding failures is:<br>\n<strong>7.2.1.1 Workflow</strong> - <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/testing.html#7.2.1.1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/testing.html#7.2.1.1\">http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/testing.html#7.2.1.1</a><br>\n<strong>Setup Execution</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All operations in a setup section (including assertions) must complete successfully for the subsequent tests to be executed. If an assertion operation in the setup section fails, then execution and evaluation of the tests in the TestScript should be skipped.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>7.2.1.5 Operation Execution</strong> - <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/testing.html#7.2.1.5\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/testing.html#7.2.1.5\">http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/testing.html#7.2.1.5</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If an operation or assertion fails, then the test ends in failure and the test script execution proceeds to the next test.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What this means is that (currently) the only way for a test engine to not execute all the defined tests is for the setup to fail. Otherwise, each individual test will execute. An individual test execution will be halted if an operation or assert fails within the definition of that test.</p>\n<p>A design enhancement to allow for conditional execution of a test based on a prior test execution result would be needed to allow for a test engine to stop running all the (remaining) tests in that situation.</p>\n<p>HTH</p>",
