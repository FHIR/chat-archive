So something like \"update patient demographics\" can be handled with a simple RESTful update to Patient.  So many of the v2 messages are no longer necessary in a FHIR space.  Thus far, those who are implementing FHIR messaging have been content to go off and define their own messages specific to their particular implementation space.  That said, if the implementation community wants to start engaging and defining \"standard\" FHIR messages - whether based on v2 or not - that's certainly possible and something HL7 would support.</p>",
