        "content": "<p>Hi Simone.  I think this is a good use case because it involves which actor roles are used based on what is being imported and how.  I'll give you my opinion piecemeal so it's easier to respond to.  </p>\n<p>1) The provenance information that is extracted from the original file/data should be extracted and identified in the new resource that is created.  The system should be able to pull that out if it's a readable file.  </p>\n<p>2) I don't think information about the software that created the original data/file matters or will be available in a majority of cases unless they have referenced the device used to author the documents.  What I'm getting at is the original software probably doesn't matter.</p>\n<p>3) The middleware is IDed as an agent.  I think it's a related agent to the local system, which is also IDed as as agent, but I think the value sets are lacking to describe this.  </p>\n<p>4)  The most important point in this whole thing for me is the agent role.  In this case, I'm talking about the local system acting as an agent and taking the message or CDA document and turning it into a resource.  If it is taking a message or PDF or flat file or anything that is reproduced on a 1:1 basis, I think the role should always be author.  It is authoring a new resource from existing data but isn't making any changes.  If I as a downstream system see this, I will know I don't have to dig any deeper or validate anything because \"author\" is used in these 1:1 cases.  If the local system is disassembling a larger document but keeping all the data intact (1:1) during the resource creation process, then \"author\" should still apply, even though the end result is distributed among more than one resource.  Even though an algorithm is being used to perform the disassembly and creation, you can still trace everything back to the original file and nothing has been modified.  That is important because it relates to downstream validation and use.  If, however, you are using logic or algorithms to alter the source data or reduce or modify anything in the full set, then assembler or composer apply.  That role ID should be reserved to ID changes that have been applied in my opinion.  It's assembler if the process is automated, without human intervention and decision-making.  It's composer if someone is actually intervening and adding their logic or selections to the software that is used to perform the action.  In that case, the human is also acting as an agent and needs to be referenced.  </p>\n<p>The larger point here is that me as a downstream system can use that scheme to figure out if I need to validate the results further or check the original to see if I can trust it as a complete data set.  The agent role matters to me for that reason.  If I see author I can just move on, if I see either of the other two, there are additional steps that I may have to implement to ensure data fidelity.  I think we should probably talk about this and define it somewhere in the spec because the implications for system operations are large.</p>",
