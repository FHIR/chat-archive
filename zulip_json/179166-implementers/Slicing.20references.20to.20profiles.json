Meaning  that if we refer to a profile for e.g. blood pressure the fixed Snomed CT code for blood pressure should be used. The problem is that “this provides the most power, since the full range of profiling capabilities are available, but it is also the hardest to implement, and requires the most processing (&gt;1000-fold compared to the others)” it should only be used if there is no other option. </p>\n<p>How should we slice the ClinicalImpression.investigation in the best way to. We want to minimize the logic required  for the external system.  Do you think slicing it on the code and then use a fixed value on the profile reference? Is that possible?</p>",
