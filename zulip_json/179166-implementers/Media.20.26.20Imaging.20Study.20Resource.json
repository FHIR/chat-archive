(2) Use of Media binary content for DICOM imaging, regardless of whether that's a thumbnail, or any other object. (3) Discussion of a SMART-on-FHIR-like framework for imaging use (e.g., PACS call out to a CAD system, dictation system, rendering system, etc.) <br>\nThe last item was Brad's proposal to discuss in January, I think. I'd like to be involved too.<br>\nThe first item will likely make its way into ImagingStudy, but may be a standard extension.

Further, in general, if you have a DICOM image, and you're constructing a Media resource, our recommendation would be to convert it to a PNG or JPEG (or MPEG) because that's much easier to present across all platforms, and if you care about quality or metadata, you shouldn't be using Media</p>",
