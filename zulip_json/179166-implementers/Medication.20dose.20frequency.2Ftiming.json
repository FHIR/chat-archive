I re-post this useful excel file every few months for those who might have missed it. Work on standardising and coding medication dose frequency/timing is really progressing well in the UK and this spreadsheet might help those of you attempting to map v2 medication messages to the new FHIR medication message structure (focusing on the medication frequency/timing part of the message).</p>",

BTW, have you had any requests to map the V2 notion of 'C' (Continuous) to FHIR frequency/timing ?      This has been a question mark for trying to determine if an order is an infusion or a 'regular' medication order.</p>",
