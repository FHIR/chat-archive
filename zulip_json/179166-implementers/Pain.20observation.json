It is a NRS Pain scale that should be communicated. 0-10.<br>\nOur first idea was to create a valueSet with the codes 0-10 with display name: NRS 0, NRS 1 etc. <br>\nIs there a best practice on how to handle such scales as an NRS. In our internal system the level is of pain is stored as a string. <br>\nDo you have any recommendations?</p>",
