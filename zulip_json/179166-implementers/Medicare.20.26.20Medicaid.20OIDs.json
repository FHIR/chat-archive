I was trying to search the HL7 OID registry so I could add the proper assigning authority OID to these.  I didn't find what looked like an official OID for either Medicare or Medicaid.  I found one for \"cms\" (2.16.840.1.113883.3.249) but this didn't allow me to differentiate between Medicare and Medicaid even though CMS is the one that assign these two numbers.</p>\n<p>Anyone have any insight into this?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>Fred</p>",
