I can find some servers, but their documentation swamps me with all sorts of Aouth options - which means given my limited knowledge of OAuth2 I'm losing track again. It's my hope to get something easy (client side) up and running - adding complexity can always be done at a later stage.</p>",

It looks like you uploaded a public key, so you can ignore the JKU fields.  Note that client registration updates take some time to sync to the sandbox (and we've been having some intermittent sync issues in the last few weeks).  Normally waiting a few hours after an update should be enough time for the client updates to make it into the sandbox.</p>",
