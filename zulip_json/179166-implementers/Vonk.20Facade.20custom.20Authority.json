However when I change the Authority property in appsettings to point to the URL of our own Identity Server, it is not able to pick up the authorization and token endpoints from my discovery endpoint situated at \"http://&lt;baseUrl&gt;/.well-known/openid-configuration\" and populate the metadata document with them in order to make use of them in a SMART on FHIR launch. I am mimicking the same behaviour that is done in the sample IdentityServer provided by Vonk in the simplifier documentation.</p>",
