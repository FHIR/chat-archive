Profile and reflexive may have nesting such as in microbiology cultures, transfusion testing, and physician convenience orders.  The nesting/grouping of orders can be met with Service Request type (original for top level, order for other orders/tiers.) <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  feel free to jump in from our workflow discussions.</p>\n<p>The laboratory performing the testing reports both the order and results as there is important clinical and semantic context in each that go together (along with the specimen/specimen resource, but will skip that for now.)  </p>\n<p>For a CBC, it is an order (see the LOINC codes for CBC, as they are all listed as orders.  all lab panels are naturally orders too.  they may be nested or added on as part of a top medical/legal requisition such as susceptibility panel added onto each organism identified in a Culture.)  The result components/observations of the CBC indicated above are the Hgb, HCT, RBC, WBC, Plt, etc.  Each would have a numeric value and listed as individual observations in a Diagnostic Report Resource (which would be used anytime there is more than one observation/result reported.)  A single Hgb request/order, can result in a single Hgb result/observation too.  </p>\n<p>The question highlights an important issue though, some implementers of the same types of data/same items may be using different resources (i.e. Hgb in Observation resource vs diagnostic report) .  Both are currently valid, but if the community implements both ways, those performing queries will need to query for both resources as one lab may have results modeled one way and another the other way.  Would be nice to recommend a single way forward to reduce variability and increase interoperability.  (DR seems the way to go.)  </p>\n<p>Also the upcoming DR discussion will be valuable to work through these issues, and also the issue of report sections.  In CG, and OO, especially with pathology and radiology reports,  the Q&amp;A/order and result pattern also exists.  There are report sections currently used and addition of special stains in pathology or FISH testing, whereby these add on orders have their own defined result components which are reported back.  They would fit into the \"nesting\" paradigm.  A CBC could be included as part of a bone marrow biopsy path report, as it is important clinical information we often referenced (although some hematopathology labs may only reference key result parameters and not the whole report).  Either way, FHIR needs to support the needs of daily patient care activities  Haven't seen a CLIA compliant complex report implemented yet (if folks know of them, please share), but hopefully will over the next year or so as FHIR adoption continues to increase.</p>\n<p>PS.  also taking an individual result component out of context may result in a patient safety issue, depending on the lab result.  (Some are fine, others not so much, which is another issue.)</p>",
