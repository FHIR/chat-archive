There isn't a single solution because v2 implementations tend to be so diverse.  However, there are strategies that might prove useful.  You can also look at the v2 mappings provided in the spec (e.g. <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-mappings.html#v2\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-mappings.html#v2\">http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-mappings.html#v2</a>) and the guidance on v2 conversion provided in the spec itself: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/comparison-v2.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/comparison-v2.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/comparison-v2.html</a></p>",
