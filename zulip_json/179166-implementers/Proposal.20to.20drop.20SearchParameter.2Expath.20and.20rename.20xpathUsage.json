However, the name is misleading as the element has nothing to do with XPath at all.  Obviously, this has been long-implemented, but in practice only a few systems work with SearchParameter at this level.  Would we be willing to rename it for clarity long term or do we want xpath to hang around in the name even though xpath is no longer used by anyone?</p>",
