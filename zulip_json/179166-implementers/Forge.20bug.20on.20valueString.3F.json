Its not what I remember from the DSTU2 version. Also, if I select the others that are not primitives, all the additional options disappear and all I see is the selected option with its actual name (valueQuantity, valueCodeableConcept, etc.). It does not seem to hurt the structure definition and it looks okay in Simplifier; at least so far. So perhaps this is just a GUI issue?</p>",
