I tried the $process-message operation, where I used POST with url -http://localhost:8080/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir/$process-message. It returned a message saying -This operation is not yet implemented on this server. If I post it to the url with/Bundle, it does accept that. But my understanding was that this could be done by posting to the root or $process-message operation so that resources could be shredded and persisted individually. Can somebody shed light on this. Thank you.</p>",
