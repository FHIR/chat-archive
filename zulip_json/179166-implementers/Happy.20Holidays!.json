It's the end of 2018 now, and I'm very aware of the fact that -- for the last 3 years -- I've been benefiting from the incredible work that this community has done. FHIR -- and ya'all -- have been an integral part of CMS' Blue Button API (the project I've been working on) and it's very hard to see how we would have been able to succeed without you.</p>\n<p>Thanks so to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191319\">@James Agnew</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191430\">@Paul Knapp</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191315\">@Josh Mandel</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> and all of you for putting up with me popping in now and then -- and then disappearing for long periods of time. I deeply wish I had more free time to give back to this incredible effort and group of people.</p>\n<p>I very much look forward to seeing the amazing things you enable and accomplish in 2019!</p>\n<p>Warmest regards,<br>\nKarl</p>",
