We thought of using the DocumentReference.type and DocumentReference.class for this purpose. With .type the PHE can search for type of instructions for use (e.g. patient’s or scientific instructions) and with .class for the specific medication of the instructions. <br>\nCan we use the .class for this purpose? Or would our use be too specific for this element?<br>\nInterested in solutions of similar use cases!</p>",
