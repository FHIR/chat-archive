The ifNoneExist parameter is based upon the identifier in both cases. However, the operation works with the Device, but not the Observation. So on the second upload of the same Bundle the response shows the Device with the expected 200, but the Observation is created with a 201. So now if I take that same identifier and use it to search, I get two identical Observation resources.</p>\n<p>Any idea what I am doing wrong? I get this result on the HAPI FHIR version 4 server and the pyro version 4 server. I do not know if the pyro is based upon HAPI.</p>",
