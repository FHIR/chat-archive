Marc explicitly reached out to me to see how we should handle your comments and I eventually told him to do what the resolution said. Since I'm not as much of an expert in regex as I'd like, I couldn't figure out if you change was more correct than what was resolved.  I totally agree with your new JIRA issue so that we can see if we missed the boat.  I'll make that we look at it in one of our upcoming MnM calls.</p>",
