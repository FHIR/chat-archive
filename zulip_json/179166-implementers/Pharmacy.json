The verification takes into account if the drug is suitable to give for the patient’s conditions, and is suitable with the other drugs the patient is currently taking plus other checks. A request has been received from a system vendor that they would like to send/receive verification information. I was wondering if the Zulip community have had any experience of implementing “Verification” information or could share their views on:<br>\n1)  Verification, in this context, is it a reasonable data item to be sharing between hospital ePMA systems and hospital Pharmacy Systems?<br>\n2)  If so which FHIR resource should the information be sent in, e.g. MedicationRequest; MedicationDespense or another resource?</p>",
