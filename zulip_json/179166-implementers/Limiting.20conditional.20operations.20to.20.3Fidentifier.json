I think most implementations (not that there are very many) compromise on transactional consistency, and we should be compromising on general-purpose search instead.</p>\n<p>All of the examples that I've seen are searches on identifier, because what the client wants is to use a business identifier instead of tracking resource IDs on every system they talk to. If this was the only thing supported, would that be useful enough?</p>",

I'm not really sure about the use cases.... most of them come out of v2 messaging, for me, but that doesn't always mean just identifier?</p>",
