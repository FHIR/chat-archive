        "content": "<p>Hi all - I think I've found a shortcomming (yes, it may have others, but keep on reading) in the capabilitystatement (more specifically STU3). In my setup, I have multiple profiles (4 to be exact)on the Appointment resource type. The business rules differs dependent on which profile a resource conforms to and resources cannot conform to more than one of the profiles (as the stated profile conformity is bound to third party integration behind the scene). My issue (its a minor issue) is that I cannot cleary express what HTTP operations are allowed on the different profiles in the capability statement as these differ. For some of the profiles, only POST and PATCH are allowed for editing (where PUT is allowed for others) - but this level of expression is AFAIK not supported by capability statements. Is this beyond what should be supported by the capabilitystatement?</p>",
