        "content": "<p>I know that MedicationStatement/-Usage and MedicationRequest have a complex relationship and some overlaps. One thing, however, that I used to think was a key difference was this: a MedicationStatement is alway information (albeit possibly imprecise) about someone actually taking/having taken a <em>concrete medical product</em>, whereas MedicationRequest is about ordered medication that is not necessarily yet \"instantiated\" as a concrete medical product (and may be instantiated by a pharmacist as a different medical product than is on the prescription). But I just realized that the spec explicitly says that a MedicationStatement/-Usage can also be used to say that \"the patient [...] will be taking the medication in the future\" (not sure how I missed that <span aria-label=\"see no evil\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f648\" role=\"img\" title=\"see no evil\">:see_no_evil:</span> ). In which case, of course, the concrete medical product is unknown.</p>\n<p>My question is then: How do we interpret a MedicationStatement about the future &amp; what use cases are targeted? In particular,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what is supposed to be covered by the phrasing \"will be taking\" (i.e. what kind of certainty/evidence)?</li>\n<li>how can we retrospectively know this was a statement about the future? E.g. must <code>dateAsserted</code> then always be filled with a date before <code>effectiveDateTime</code>/<code>effectivePeriod.end</code>? The latter would not allow encoding \"the patient will be taking this at some unknown point in the future\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A concrete use case is this: The International Patient Summary (IPS) lists current medications using MedicationStatements. Suppose now that a patient is given a prescription, e.g. on being discharged from a hospital.  One could perhaps argue that when the corresponding MedicationRequests is generated, one could also quite automatically generate a future MedicationStatement by interpreting the prescriptions as a statement about medications that patient will (presumably) be taking later.  Would that be legal, assuming the \"futureness\" can be recognized? I know such an automatic conversion is not possible <em>retrospectively</em> because the patient may have gotten a different medication than what was prescribed (or may not have filled the prescription at all).</p>",

I can see there are definitely sensible future use cases, but the exact distinctions are not easy. E.g. in <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/medicationusage.html#bnr\">the table listing the differences between the medication resources</a>, the grammatical tense seems to suggests only backward-looking usage  (my emphasis):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A medication statement is not a part of the prescribe-&gt;dispense-&gt;administer sequence but is a report that such a sequence (or at least a part of it) <em>did take place</em>, resulting in a belief that the patient <em>has received</em> a particular medication.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think a further point that makes the overlap confusing is that a MedicationRequest can be reported by a patient (<code>informationSource</code> can point to a Patient). <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191759\">@Melva Peters</span> What is the use case covered by a patient-reported MedicationRequest that is not covered by MedicationUsage/-Statement?</p>\n<p>Picking up <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>'s example of a possible future use of MedicationStatement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It's prescribed and I'm supposed to be on it, but that hasn't quite begun yet\",</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems to me that although this is not <em>equivalent</em> to a MedicationRequest, this statement can be <em>derived from</em> a MedicationRequest (with <code>intent</code> e.g. \"active\"), insofar as the latter expresses the intent (on part of the prescriber) that the patient will/should be taking a medication. Specifically, suppose I have a MedicationRequest with the following properties</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>status</code> =  \"active\" (or \"completed\")</li>\n<li><code>intent</code> = \"order\"</li>\n<li><code>requester</code> = Doctor X</li>\n<li><code>authoredOn</code> =  date D </li>\n<li><code>medication</code> =  medication M</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then it seems one can automatically derive a MediationStatement/-Usage with the following properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>status</code> = \"intended\"</li>\n<li><code>basedOn</code> = [medication request above]</li>\n<li><code>dateAsserted</code> =  date D</li>\n<li><code>informationSource</code> = Doctor X</li>\n<li><code>medication</code> = medication M</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Or would the latter incorrectly imply something that is not implied by the MedicationRequest?
