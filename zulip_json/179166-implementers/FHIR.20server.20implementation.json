I'd recommend either <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-codegen\">fhir-codegen</a>, which uses C# to export language files (you'd need to add go-lang) (disclosure: I maintain that project) or <a href=\"https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/fhir-parser\">fhir-parser</a>, which uses Python and Jinja templates (again, you'd need to build templates for go-lang).  Both projects have 'production' software being exported from them, so it's a matter of what you're more comfortable with.</p>\n<p>That said, having a good understanding of FHIR will be somewhere between useful and required to be successful on that step.</p>\n<p>I've also (via fhir-codegen) been working on OpenAPI exports, which could theoretically be used to build the skeleton for a go-lang server.  I don't think the OpenAPI files are quite 'there' yet, but you can see an example on <a href=\"https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/GinoCanessa/fhir-r_4_4_0_1/1.0.0#/\">SwaggerHub</a>.</p>",
