I'm looking to standardize the names of the incoming observed properties. I'm guessing LOINC is a solid option and would cover many of these properties, but I am unsure the extent of coverage I can expect and what other controlled terminologies would help increase the coverage. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"251702\">@Robert Lyons</span> LOINC is indeed a solid option and covers many common (and less common) sensor observations. It gets wide use in the US, but is perhaps a bit less familiar internationally. LOINC is justly famous for laboratory observations; sensor observations are a little less its focus, although through the efforts of Dr. Swapna Abyankar it is getting strengthened in the device area. Another terminology resource you should be aware of is the ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 (and others in the -1010x series of standards) Medical Device Nomenclature (see <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mdc.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mdc.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mdc.html</a> for a quick intro, and <a href=\"https://rtmms.nist.gov/rtmms/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://rtmms.nist.gov/rtmms/index.htm\">https://rtmms.nist.gov/rtmms/index.htm</a> for an online reference database maintained by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology), which is almost solely device and sensor-oriented. It is strongest for devices and sensors used in acute-care settings but includes some personal health devices - coverage of wearables is incomplete but the database and supporting standards are open to suggestions for additions. Full disclosure: I'm chair of the IEEE 11073 Point-of-Care work group. Would be happy to discuss further.</p>",

LOINC is a community-driven effort (new content is added  by end-user requests), so if there are variables you have that aren't in LOINC, a submission would be welcome (see <a href=\"https://loinc.org/submissions/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://loinc.org/submissions/\">https://loinc.org/submissions/</a>). The ongoing LOINC/IEEE collaboration (<a href=\"https://loinc.org/collaboration/ieee/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://loinc.org/collaboration/ieee/\">https://loinc.org/collaboration/ieee/</a>) has produced a mapping between IEEE variables and LOINC Codes. You can get that mapping via LOINC's FHIR terminology services too.</p>",

LOINC has the benefit of being interpretable by many EHRs used in the US and is consistent with US core specifications for many device measured.
