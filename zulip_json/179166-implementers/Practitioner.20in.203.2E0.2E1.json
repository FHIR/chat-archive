        "content": "<p>Hi All,<br>\nThis is regarding the ‘Practitioner’ resource <br>\nIn our implementation, we map Practitioner as a contained reference from ExplanationOfBenefit resource. The expectation is to get Practitioner’s role and employment details (Organization) to be available along with Practitioner resource itself while someone accesses ExplanationOfBenefit. This was working well with Practitioner 1.4.0 with the ‘practitionerRole’ element. In FHIR 3.0.1 ‘practitionerRole’ elements has been removed and it doesn’t look like there is any way to know about the Practitioner Role ad associated organization from the Practitioner resource.  All these information are now available with PractitionerRole resource, however there is no links given from Practitioner to PractitionerRole.</p>\n<p>In this scenario, I would like to understand the recommendation about how I can map Practitioner so that I can get the role and employment details. An extension of type PractitionerRole from Practitioner? <br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  any suggestion ?</p>",
