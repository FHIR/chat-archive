If a transfer of care request (e.g. to a special skilled facility, is sent using the merged resource, but the requester does not want the subject to be transferred/discharged to a \"long term care facility\", there is no structure in the resource to support that. The request.code value will be \"transfer to skilled nursing facility\". If the request.doNotPerform\" value is set to true, the result will be exactly the opposite of what the requester intended.  One can argue that the requester can send a separate request with request.code = \"long term care facility\" and request.doNotPerform = true. This will be a very cumbersome way to do that with high potential of causing confusions. It also raises the question of - how to link the two request together?

Even if this issue is addressed, the design principle that any changes or designs do not need to be clinically appropriate is hugely problematic.

The way data is shared needs to support clinically-appropriate display, but won't necessarily organize data for exchange in the same way that clinicians might want it organized for capture or presentation.  The focus of an interface standard is what will work for the software solutions that need to do the exchange.  Enabling clinically appropriate capture/display is <em>one</em> of the considerations of such implementations, but it's not the only one and must remain in balance with other requirements such as implementability, reuseability, maintainability, support for legacy, etc.  Thus the creation of solutions that mix data that would rarely be clinically appropriate to capture/display together (e.g. pulse rate, antibiotic suceptibility, hemogolobin and smoking status) in a single resource (e.g. Observation)</p>",
