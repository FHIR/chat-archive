That said, the page does not work for me - too large for SwaggerHub :-/.</p>\n<p>So, attached is a Zip with the OAS 3 JSON file I used to import that: <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/X6KQgcdWnU9vmIFoFiSL64yo/OpenApi_R4.zip\">OpenApi_R4.zip</a>.  That's part of why I've moved my focus from static output to tooling - beyond things like files being too large, there are many issues with workflow (e.g., required casing of symbols, etc.).</p>\n<p>Beyond the more practical issues above are the questions around usability - most languages would be better served with code that uses their FHIR libraries (e.g., Java code should use HAPI, C# code should use Firely, etc.).  None of the OpenAPI code generators can do that today, and I'm not sold on trying to do it there.  But, doing \"something\" in that space is surfacing on my to-do list, so I hope to be able to put <em>something</em> up for discussion soon.</p>",
