When making an extension mandatory (or any other mandatory slicing, since adding extensions is under the hood just slicing the extensions array) Forge does not update the cardinality of the extension element itself. We'll start auto-calculating that extensions cardinality for you soon in Forge.</p>\n<p>Do you have a link to an example where the validator does not complain about the missing mandatory extension? Because in my understanding the validator basically ignores the cardinality of the extension element and treats those slices as mandatory, even if cardinality of extension is <code>0..*</code>. For instance, with <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/touchstonedemoproject/patient01-noextensions/$validate\">this Patient example</a>, which is based on <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/TouchstoneDemoproject/PatientMandatoryExtensions-duplicate-3/~overview\">this Patient profile having the <code>0..*</code> on extensions</a>.</p>",
