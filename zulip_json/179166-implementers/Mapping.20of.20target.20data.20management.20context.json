We want to provide the possibility to store Diagnostic Reports in our system in different logical units representing the organizational structure of a clinical institution. This serves as a kind of data management context.</p>\n<p>Since this information is not a direct property of a single Diagnostic Report we thought of the meta element.<br>\nThe source information of the meta element allow us to properly identify the sending application. What we are missing is where we could require to provide the information about this logical unit to store the Diagnostic Report within. We thought of defining an own extension for the meta element. Actually I just need a name to identify the proper data management context. I wonder, if anyone has concerns about such an approach or any other idea how to best transmit this kind of information?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",

But thinking of supporting additional resources (where we face the same issue) that doesn't scale. Like e.g. DocumentReference.category has a complete different meaning.</p>",
