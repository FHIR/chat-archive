An immediate interface may indeed be point-to-point between only two partners who have very tight requirements.  But that data eventually flows elsewhere.  And SMART will almost certainly find applicability in the UK and everywhere else.

However, for SMART or any app-based approach to use of healthcare data to work (simple client that can automatically work in a wide variety of data environments), a certain degree of consistency of data is necessary.  Some data will be very hard/expensive to get consistent enough to work.  But other pieces aren't so difficult.  There's certainly a cost, but it's small.  And the benefit in terms of what you can then start to do with the data is large.  In this case, we're talking about standardizing codes for ~20 vital signs observation types.  The incremental cost is the need to translate from whatever code systems you're using for that limited number of data elements.  The benefit is that you can then use standard apps regardless of where you are in the world to render &amp; analyze key health metrics.</p>",

When you start dealing with vital signs in a mixed care envrironment, you'll start dealing with different kinds of observation methods - different ways of taking temperatures, for instance.
