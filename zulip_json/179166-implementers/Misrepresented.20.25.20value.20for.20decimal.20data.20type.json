We realize we are not conforming to the decimal data type for representing a percentage, but we already have consumers integrated with the resource who have never mentioned this.  Are there any strategies to represent the correct decimal value for new consumer who are currently integrating while not impacting existing consumers and providing them the appropriate amount of time to make the necessary changes on their end?</p>",
