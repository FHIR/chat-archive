This ValueSet not only includes CodeSystem <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/identifier-type\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/identifier-type\">http://hl7.org/fhir/identifier-type</a> but also includes some concepts from CodeSystem <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0203\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0203\">http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/0203</a></p>\n<p>e.g.2 The CodeSystem <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/marital-status\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/marital-status\">http://hl7.org/fhir/marital-status</a> has a CodeSystem.valueSet value of <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/marital-status\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/marital-status\">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/marital-status</a> but this valueset doesn't even include CodeSystem <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/marital-status\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/marital-status\">http://hl7.org/fhir/marital-status</a>. It includes some other codesystems.</p>\n<p>My questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For a STU3 FHIR server, is it safe to continue using these codesysetms and valuesets or should they be updated to some corrected version?</li>\n<li>Wanted to get clarification on whether an implicit valueset means, \"all the concepts defined in a codesystem and only those concepts\" or \"all the concepts defined in the codesystem + more\" or something else?</li>\n</ol>",
