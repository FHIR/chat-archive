I agree that Gherkin is great high-level BDD DSL for (1). Are you aware of a FHIR-specific Gherkin test runner for (3)? If not, there may be a gap, in that someone would need to write executable tests based off the Gherkin in (1) [^1]. Partial duplication and an invitation for (human) error, drift and incomplete test coverage.</p>\n<p>Since Cucumber is already implemented many languages, I can imagine a sushi/fsh executor for Cucumber. One writes sushi/fsh Gherkin which is executable by Cucumber.</p>\n<p>I found one mention of this approach in the FHIR chat, but as of yet no implementation.<br>\n<a href=\"#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/testscript.20executor\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/testscript.20executor</a></p>\n<p>[^1] Alternatively, are you of the opinion that there is no gap. That the human-readable Gherkin is _intended_ as non-executable contract between the Actors and the IG authors. That the executable tests need to be written separately in (3) is a feature not a bug: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10194242\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10194242</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
