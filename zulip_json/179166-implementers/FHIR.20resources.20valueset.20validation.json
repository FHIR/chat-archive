Or is there a tool that can convert the the raw format to FHIR format that the FHIR validator need for validation.</p>\n<p>For example: below are links to valueset files for few data points.<br>\nCondition verification status: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/dstu2/valueset-condition-ver-status.json.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/dstu2/valueset-condition-ver-status.json.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/dstu2/valueset-condition-ver-status.json.html</a><br>\nCOndition clinical status: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/dstu2/valueset-condition-clinical.json.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/dstu2/valueset-condition-clinical.json.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/dstu2/valueset-condition-clinical.json.html</a></p>\n<p>We had implemented &amp; setup the CDA scorecard/validation project (<a href=\"https://sitenv.org/ccda-smart-scorecard/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://sitenv.org/ccda-smart-scorecard/\">https://sitenv.org/ccda-smart-scorecard/</a>), and had to place the raw valueset file for RxNorm, SNOMED, etc in the folder mentioned in setup document. Do we have a similar setup on the FHIR side?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>",
