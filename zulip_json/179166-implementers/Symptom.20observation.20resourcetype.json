(Condition is for something you want to track over time, Observation is for point-in-time assertion.)  With an Observation, you could possibly capture some of the details as Observation.components.  For Condition, some will map to existing Observation discrete values like onset or severity.  Others would typically live in free text in Condition.code.text, though you could also use extensions on Condition to capture the discrete values if you felt them useful to share (and thought others would support them as discrete too).  If you think some of them will be widely supported, you could submit a change request to have them considered for inclusion as standard elements or extensions.</p>",
