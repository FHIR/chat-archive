However, I believe checkbox would not be a good mechanism because usually checkboxes do not require either choice to be made (checked).   Maybe a radio button with the Yes/No choice and maybe some code to ensure that at least one was chosen, might be needed.   I suppose the advantage of using checkboxes is that you can use this for any 'multiple choice' answer in a questionnaire.   (I'm not familiar with FHIR Questionnaire but does it convey the sense of 'required input' or not?)</p>",
