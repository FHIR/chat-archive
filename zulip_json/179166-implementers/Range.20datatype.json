As such:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>onsetDateTime can be used for an actual date, such as 1/1/2017 </li>\n<li>onsetAge can be used for an actual age, such as 2 years old</li>\n<li>onsetPeriod can be used for an estimated date, such as between 1/15/2017 and 2/15/2017</li>\n<li>onsetRange can be used for an estimated age, such as between 2 years old and 5 years old</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Personally, I dislike using onsetRange to say 3-4 months ago since it is relative to some anchor (e.g. Condition.assertedDate?) and it could cause confusion for users who might incorrectly assume it is based on today's date instead of the assertedDate.  It seems risky and error-prone to do that.</p>",
