In FHIR there is a core extension for DataAbsentReason (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/extension-data-absent-reason.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/extension-data-absent-reason.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/extension-data-absent-reason.html</a>) that seems to mimic NullFlavor. But can also still add \"unknown\", \"other\" etc. to a ValueSet if the target element is coded in some way.<br>\n.<br>\nThat leaves you with two options. Depending on a (core) extension for this is only possible in a controlled setting where this explicitly required in implementation guides. It is also the only option as far as I can tell when the context element is not coded. If you use the ValueSet-with-null-included then a regular receiver is not likely to miss the dataabsentreason.<br>\n.<br>\nHow do people handle or avoid DataAbsentReason?</p>",

And, for that matter, a companion element allowing capture of the reason for missing data should be provided for non-coded elements if this falls within the 80% (e.g. Observation.dataAbsentReason).  The data-absent-reason extension is for use when such information is not supported by most systems.</p>",
