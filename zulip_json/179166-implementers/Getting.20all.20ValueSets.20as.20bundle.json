The obvious way is to do a search, which in theory will return all ValueSet resources in a Bundle. Problem is that these ValueSet can get really big, and for the moment I just want to present the user which valuesets are available, and getting the contents of really large ones seems like an overkill. Is there any other way to query resources and get only references?</p>",
