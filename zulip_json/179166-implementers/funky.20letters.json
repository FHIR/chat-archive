Due to the weak process and tooling for v3 maintenance before UTG, text from Microsoft Word documents was read by the tools and inserted directly into the database.   Unfortunately, Microsoft Word has these irritating objects 'smart quotes' which when read by the java code and imported to the xml, were dutifully brought in and the ASCII renders as the funky things you see.  We had a number of regular submitters of MANY new code systems and codes in V3 who for YEARS submitted proposals with these problems.   We had no automatic tooling to detect or fix them, so it was up to me to manually recognize them, and for the original submitter to report them back in the manual QA review to be fixed later (and this was often skipped or done less well than hoped).  The upshot is that the v3 content is rife with this garbage, randomly sprinkled throughout.   When we imported the V3 coreif to UTG with java software, guess what?  Garbage in, garbage out.   So...they are in UTG as well.   Now the new process will be able to both prevent this from happening in the future, and allow these to be fixed by those who see them.   This is exactly the kind of content scrubbing I hope the UTG crowd-source availability of changes will enable.  So...feel free to sign up for the Pilot and fix them as you see them and are irrupted by them - have at it!</p>",

Grahame disagrees, but I am feeling that even such miniscule changes should be documented with Provenance resource instances for the history tracking.  Ideally, a new additional bundle in input/sourceOfTruth/history of \"hxutg1-1-6\"; if you look at 1-0-5 all the naming conventions are pretty obvious and algorithmic - these bundles were all created by scripts for the release.   If we can fix the single and double rotes (should be 95% of them) with this, then lets do it.   Provenance.recorded.reason.text can be \"Fixed bad UTF characters from the coremif V3 source.\"    You can be author, Vocabulary WG as custodian.   That will do it, properly and completely.</p>",
