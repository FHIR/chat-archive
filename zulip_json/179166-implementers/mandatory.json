You'll find tighter requirements in implementation guides.  For example, <a href=\"http://Patient.name\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Patient.name\">Patient.name</a> is optional in the base spec, because we need to allow for situations where the name is unknown, where the patient is anonymous and for where the patient is a chicken that doesn't have a name.  However, the U.S. Core implementation guide which is used for EHR human-centric querying requires patients to have a name - because in that context, the use-cases for no name don't apply.</p>",
