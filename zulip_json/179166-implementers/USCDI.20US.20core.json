If a hospital is paying a downstream system for services, it may have leverage to get that system to improve the standardization of its coding.  If not, no such luck.

If you don't want to force systems to use a particular set of codes all the time, then 'required' and 'extensible' aren't for you.

FHIR (USCORE) requires code system X. My data store doesn't have code system X. How do I resolve that? Who tells the Providers that they SHALL record in code system X? Who enforces it? Who tells the EHR vendors that they have to upgrade their systems to allow usage of code system X? Who tells the providers they have to upgrade to new EHR software? Plus all the points raised above (patient entered, foreign source, historical). </p>\n<p>All of this means that the interop person looks at a pile of data, often in a proprietary code system, and asks how do I get to standard from here? </p>\n<p>The only answer, much like the game we played during CCDA certification. We output what we have/can and IG/Standard/requirement be \"ignored\". We structure our solution such that IF EHR supports entering code system X AND the provider licensed code systems X AND the provider chooses to enter code system X then the FHIR resource will have code system X. The system has the capability of meeting conformance if all the dominoes fall correctly. Should a regulatory agency knock, look right here at this test patient all the boxes are checked and meet standard. That data that brought you here was old, hasn't been converted, provider hasn't started using ..... You have test data you want us to use? Sure let us load it into the system... ta da!</p>\n<p>Yes there are converters for some (inter)national code systems to other (inter)national code systems. Some only go one way. Easy to go from icd-10 to 9 but not the other way. Plus any \"automated\" translation of clinical coding has to be vetted at the highest level. One little bit of incorrect transpose and the patient goes from \"allergic to latex\" to \"NOT allergic to latex\". Better to not risk an incorrect translation than worry about any particular resource not complying with a standard. If there is an industry accepted, useable everywhere, understood to be 99.99% accurate code system Y to code system X translator available, then what's the point of limiting the resource to X, it could be X or Y and if the receiver needed X they can use the translator.</p>\n<p>Value Sets (Code systems) have to have all appropriate values (probably good here). EHRs need to only allow items from corresponding value set (no where close in my experience). Standards need to allow any value that was ever in the value set (any version), not just current. This allows historical data to conform. \"When recorded X was a valid value, now 2 years later we don't use that anymore, at least we don't get dinged for invalid resources .\" If all of the professional systems record the standard values, transmit the standard values, receive the standard values, then those little odd ball items (patient entered, etc) probably probably fall to the \"oh well\" bucket.</p>",

We have an internal record that represents something (e.g. an influenza vaccine), and we (normally some IT staff with clinical review) map it to the relevant standard terminologies (e.g. CVX).</li>\n<li>\"Stamping.\"  In this case, we stamp a code on a record when we create the record.  This is different from mapping, because if you re-map a record, that will immediately change the codes returned for all resources.  Stamping means that you can't (easily) remap.  The code we stamp on the record may be from an Epic-internal source, but most often we are getting the code from an external system.  The most common example is lab results, where the lab system tells us the LOINC code and we stamp it on the result.  Another example is CDA document exchange, where we will file content from a CDA document, using the codes we got from the sending system.</li>\n<li>\"User-entered\".
