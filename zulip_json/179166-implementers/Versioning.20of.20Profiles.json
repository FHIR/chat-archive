Does the new version only allow to tighten the constrains/extensions of the last version on this server ?, or<br>\n2. Is it allowed to publish completely new constrains/extensions with this version independent of the last version ?</p>\n<p>If 2. were allowed, what would happen to resources stored on this server for this profile that contain fields that are no longer contained in the new version of the profile ? I tried to get the answer to this question from chapter 5.1.0 Profiling FHIR, but I am not sure about my question. I am unsure if the specification in this chapter is only about extending profile or also about publishing new versions of the same profile.<br>\nGreetings</p>",

If you change the profile, such that the resources that conform to the profile before the change still conform  to it afterwards, then it's a new version of the same profile. If they don't... then you probably have a new profile</p>",
