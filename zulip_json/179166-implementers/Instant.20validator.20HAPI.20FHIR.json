Sometimes users will send data without certain properties and HAPI FHIR would valid them. We want to build our own IG (Fhir shorthand) and load this IG in Hapi Fhir that way when users send data Hap Fhir will not test the bundle against the default IG but against our own IG. as an example: <a href=\"https://github.com/jembi/instantohie-hapi-fhir-ig-importer\">https://github.com/jembi/instantohie-hapi-fhir-ig-importer</a></p>\n<p>How do I achieve this? Even the GitHub link does not clarify it well for me. The HAPI FHIR docs is not clear at all. <br>\nI will appreciate your help and directions. </p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>",
