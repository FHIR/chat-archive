For my internal use, I want to extend that idea to include a larger set of payloadTypes and I'm looking for examples to see if I can re-use / steal a pattern for defining the URIs in my extended value set. (and in case it matters, the use case is that I'm sending messages among a large number of EMR systems who have implemented the various message types in 'creative' and individual ways, so I need a much finer-grained list than simply message type in order to know what a given system can receive). Thanks for any pointers...</p>",
