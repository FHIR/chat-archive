The use case I have in mind is where an IG is in productive use but still being extended or modified in (primarily) non-breaking ways (i.e. MINOR changes in the SemVer lingo) - as one might have it in a very dynamic situation like COVID-19. Typical change examples would be changes in individual codes or value sets.  In such a scenario, it would be ideal to equip each update with a \"migration script\" to allows user to bring their already collected data to the latest IG stage (or  researcher to do it at a later point to pool data). Are there examples of that?</p>",

Specifically, I was thinking of the case where there is a 1-to-1 relation between the codes in the old and the new value set so a precise mapping is possible (in QuestionnaireResponse instances).  For instance, both SNOMED and LOINC have code codes for \"yes\" and \"no\", so one could switch from one to the other and still map the data. </p>\n<p>Background: In Germany, there is an ongoing effort to align the (FHIR) data collected on COVID-19, the <a href=\"http://cocos.team\">COCOS initiative</a>. We put out an IG for a COVID questionnaire app while this initiative was just getting started. However, in some instances the codes we used  differ from those COCOS is now converging on. Hence, I am considering how to align our IG while still providing a \"bridge\" for existing data. COCOS hat tip to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191532\">@dr Kai U.
