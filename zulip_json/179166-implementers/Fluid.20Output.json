Unfortunately I don't know UCUM well enough, and there is no example for something that is \"over x hours\" so I'm not sure what the unit should be. I'm hoping someone might know how this could be done, and I'll do more investigating. I'm thinking something like \"500 mL (over 1.h)\" for 1 hour.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Ok, based on a discussion with Clem, it seems representing the duration of collection as a UCUM unit is not acceptable. The expectation is that each drain type collection duration would be a unique LOINC code (i.e.; it is a specific test, and likely would be ordered that way.) There quite a few in there already, just not for the ones you want. So I think you need to request them as new LOINC codes using the approach noted here <a href=\"https://loinc.org/submissions/new-terms/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://loinc.org/submissions/new-terms/\">https://loinc.org/submissions/new-terms/</a></p>",
