We started using the term \"magic number\" with respect to the vital signs profiles to help certain stakeholders get over the fact that we were mandating the appearance of LOINC codes in all vital signs Observations.  The point was that it didn't matter that the chosen code was LOINC.  What mattered is that it was a single \"magic\" code that could be used to determine that something was a body temperature, a weight, a blood pressure, etc.  LOINC was chosen because of its relative widespread use and its free international availability.  It would certainly be possible for the UK to define an <em>additional</em> magic number if they wanted to mandate the use of a specific SNOMED code in addition to the LOINC code (perhaps for easy population of the LOINC code, possibly for other reasons).  But you'd still have to send the LOINC code defined by the international profiles.</p>",
