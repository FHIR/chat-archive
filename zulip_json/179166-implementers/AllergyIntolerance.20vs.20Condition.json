This is something GPs do here on a day-to-day basis, They call that \"episode-based-record-keeping\" [forgive me my potentially awkward translation]. You come in with a complaint of some sort. This complaint is compared to known complaints i.e. the \"problem list\". If it is a known complaint, it is linked to that one, otherwise it is added to the problem list if it needs tracking of some sorts over time.</p>\n<p>The problem list provides an overview to the GP. Problems may evolve over time e.g. from stomach ache to bowel cancer. So you have a managed chain of conditions/problems connected to S-O-A-P based encounter activities, therapies, labs etc.</p>\n<p>But beyond GPs I would expect any specialist to be interest in if/how/how regular a condition manifests itself</p>",

It sounds like the Dutch GP's are doing this the \"right\" way for episode-based (and problem-oriented) record keeping.  That's also the way that it's been taught (at least in the Family Medicine academic centers that I'm most familiar with) in US primary care for a long time.  I'm not sure how consistently that's being done now across the board in US primary care, but the notion is certainly there.  And I agree that we need to be able to support this (by some means in the 80%) in FHIR.  Honestly, it hadn't really registered with me that probably we don't currently support it (though it mentions manifestations, 'evidence' is targeted to \"the basis of the Condition's verification status\" and none of the extensions seem to quite cover it - so maybe an additional 'manifestation' element is needed?).  And Condition is FMM 3, so we do potentially have the opportunity to add explicit support for this.</p>",

The observation that is judged to be a manifestation of the particular problem does occur subsequent to the problem/condition itself.  So that would seem to indicate that the Observation should point to the Condition.  But actually I think that there is a separate step involved.  The observation itself should probably stand alone - it is just what is observed, regardless of the particular problems/conditions that previously have been identified.  Then there is a subsequent step involving clinical judgement that would identify and associate the observation as being a manifestation of a particular condition.  So I think still that a 'manifestation' element on Condition indicating the Observation(s) that have been judged to be manifestations of the Condition may be the best way to represent this.  If so, that makes it a PC issue (and I agree that the currently existing 'evidence' element probably isn't quite the right semantic for this).</p>",
