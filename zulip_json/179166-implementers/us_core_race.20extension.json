We've received direction to use the us_core_race extension, but the only link I find to the extension, <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-race\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-race\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-race</a>, does not work.  It looks like the extension was used in DSTU1 and 2, but has not been used in STU3 or R4.  </p>\n<p>Am I missing something?  or is there an updated extension to use?  </p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>",

This represents a unique identifier for the extension. In FHIR, references to profiles are always based on the canonical url. FHIR encourages profile authors to actually host a descriptive html page at the canonical url address, however this is not mandatory. In this case, the canonical url is slightly different from the page location. Just make sure you use the actual canonical url in your profiles/IG and not the page address.</p>",
