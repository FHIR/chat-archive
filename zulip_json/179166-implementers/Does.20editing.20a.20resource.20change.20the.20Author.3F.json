Now a Practioner adds more information to this resource and a new version is created. Who is then the author/recorder? The cardinatlity is 0...1, so we can't have multiple authors. Do we change the recorder to be the Practioner and if one wants the history of this object, one needs to look at previous version? Or do you create a brand new resource and point to the old one using Provenance?</p>",

If someone revamps a Condition to change the onset date and severity, that might change the author.  Also, you need to look at the definition of the element.  Some are clearly linked to 'original' author, others not.</p>",
