Can the \"pure\" FHIR object be embedded here as a JSON subobject?<br>\n   Example:<br>\n   {<br>\n      \"other\": {...}<br>\n      \"fhir\": {...}<br>\n   }<br>\n5) How can a CDSS specify required/optional data (patient master data, diagnoses, laboratory values...) in a structured way so that a client knows pre-request which data is required?</p>\n<p>Grateful for any help<br>\nHave a nice day! <span aria-label=\"pray\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f64f\" role=\"img\" title=\"pray\">:pray:</span></p>",
