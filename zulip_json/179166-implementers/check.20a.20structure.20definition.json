The IG Publisher simply does nothing. Gives no error messages and generates no output. I am probably doing it wrong; but I don't know. Its a fairly simple profile; generated in Forge and then modified for version 3.5.0. Thus the only changes are the fields specifying the versions. The difference fields are very limited.
