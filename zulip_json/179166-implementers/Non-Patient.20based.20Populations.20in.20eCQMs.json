That is done by returning the, in their case, encounters from the, then called <code>InitialPolulation</code> expression. Normally one would have an <code>InInitialPopulation</code> expression just returning true/false for inclusion of each patient.</p>\n<p>The following paragraph in section 3.4.1 makes that clear:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the measure type, measures generally fall into two categories, patient-based, and non-patient-based (e.g. encounter-based). In general, patient-based measures count the number of patients in each population, while non-patient-based measures count the number of items (such as encounters) in each population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question is simply whether this is considered possible in a common case or whether this is special to the mentioned IG. I also have the question how it is specified in the Measure resource of which type the populations are. I also ask because this non-patient based populations are not mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/clinicalreasoning-quality-reporting.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/clinicalreasoning-quality-reporting.html\">Quality Reporting</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191401\">@Eric Haas</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192672\">@Floyd Eisenberg</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191359\">@Bryn Rhodes</span></p>",
