Only thing HAPI contains is a bearer token interceptor. What i'm looking forward to is coding all the necessary \"path\" to get that token (through smart-on-fhir Oauth2 implementation): client ID, login, token, etc.<br>\nI think Swift already has the semi-official library for Smart-on-Fhir, but i couldn't find something for Android (only some Java - Spring work).<br>\nThanks for the reply though!</p>",
