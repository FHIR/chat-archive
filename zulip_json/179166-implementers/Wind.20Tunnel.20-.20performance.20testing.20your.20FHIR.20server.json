I've demoed it at DevDays and there was interest from server makers so here it is: <a href=\"https://github.com/FirelyTeam/Wind.Tunnel\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/FirelyTeam/Wind.Tunnel\">https://github.com/FirelyTeam/Wind.Tunnel</a></p>\n<p>There's a few known issues with making it more generic for everyone's use so this release is a beta. Give it a go, we'd love your feedback on this!</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191318\">@nicola (RIO/SS)</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191319\">@James Agnew</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191496\">@Nikolai Schwertner</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191367\">@Brian Postlethwaite</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"195775\">@Michael Hansen</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191370\">@Richard Ettema</span> </p>\n<p>Note that it's no good for benchmarking different FHIR servers - since running tests on better hardware will get you better results. The intention here is - given the same hardware, see how you perform with different setups</p>",
