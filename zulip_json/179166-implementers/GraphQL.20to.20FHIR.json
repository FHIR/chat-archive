So we need to write the resolvers on our own depending on our db. We forked the asymmetrik GraphQL server and are writing resolvers to fetch from Mongodb. This is far from complete, but is open source and can be accessed at <a href=\"https://github.com/HL7India/graphql-fhir\">https://github.com/HL7India/graphql-fhir</a></p>",
