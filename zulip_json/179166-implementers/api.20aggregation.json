I am evaluating one such platform called Netflix Falcor. This is a server and client library that abstracts DataSources allowing your data to come from an in-memory cache or static mock data, a local computation, or remote REST endpoint(s). The server library is javascript that runs embedded in a Node.js instance.  </p>\n<p>Example Use case:<br>\nQuery a patient and some or all of the References also get queried and embedded within the result.</p>\n<p>Required:<br>\nA public Fhir instance with references populated (Patient or other domain object is OK for my demo)</p>\n<p>Does anyone know where I can find data that included valid References that I can se in my demo? Or if you could show me how to populate some dummy refs I would appreciate it.<br>\nAlso,  if you have any ideas for other use cases of API Aggregation in the context of Fhir, your thoughts would be appreciated.</p>",
