When I use the FHIR 1.8 igpublisher jar to build an IG, external non-FHIR value set references are getting stripped of the first nine letters -- resulting in broken links.  For example, instead of <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/daf-observation-ccdasmokingstatus</code>, it's getting rendered as <code>7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/daf-observation-ccdasmokingstatus</code>.  Is this happening because I don't formally note us-core as a dependency in my IG config files?  Or is it something else?</p>",
