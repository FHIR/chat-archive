I was able to install and try out HAPI-FHIR in the past, but I believe this instance utilizes the base FHIR resources. I guess our concern here is that, now that we have FHIR profiles, how will we be able to implement/import these into a FHIR server, for example a HAPI-FHIR instance? Are there any resources we can check out for this procedure? Thank you very much!</p>",

But the idea I have in mind is to have the HAPI server accept data, validate it against our custom FHIR profiles, then store it in the database. Then also allow clients to fetch, search, edit, delete data (typical FHIR functions). When it comes to your question, I think the second one's closer to what I want to do.</p>",

Messaging interfaces, custom operations, security protocols, anything described in free text will all need to be hand-coded or otherwise configured into the behavior of the server.  You certainly <em>can</em> make the code systems, value sets, profiles, etc. that are defined by the IG available to the server to use in validation, however you'd still have to set rules about when to invoke that validation - do you expect all of your inbound instances to be valid against specific profiles?  Only instances from certain places?  Only validate if the instance declares conformance with the profile (which you generally shouldn't count on)?</p>",
