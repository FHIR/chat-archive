Our question is  the following when LIS lab returns their representation of lab request , how should we interpret the sample-objects within the lab request: should each sample correspond to a single Specimen or  should there be just one Specimen with container(backbone-element) per sample?</p>",

Surely the LIS vendor uses some sort of data model, they should be able to tell you what their relationship model is for request-seample-container, and what identifiers (if any) they assign to these entities. Without additional information your question will be impossible to answer.</p>",
