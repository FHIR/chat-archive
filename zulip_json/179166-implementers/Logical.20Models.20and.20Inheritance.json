You said \"you can only constrain or specialise...\"  We interpreted that to mean that a logical model cannot constrain an element it inherited from its parent.</p>\n<p>But... can a logical model constrain a subpath of an element it introduced?  For example, let's say a logical model (<code>PersonModel</code>) introduces an element <code>PersonModel.name</code> that has type <code>HumanName</code>.  Can we constrain <code>PersonModel.name.given</code> to <code>1..1</code> in the logical model?</p>",

If a logical model inherits a backbone element from its parent, is it legal for the child Logical Model to add new sub-elements to the original backbone element that it inherited? Something like the following:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Logical: LogicalParent\n* food 1..1 BackboneElement &quot;Food&quot; &quot;The foods a person ate in a day&quot;\n* food.breakfast 1..1 string &quot;Breakfast&quot; &quot;The meal eaten in the morning&quot;\n\nLogical: LogicalChild\nParent: LogicalParent\n* food.lunch 1..1 string &quot;Lunch&quot; &quot;The second meal of the day&quot;\n* food.dinner 1..1 string &quot;Dinner&quot; &quot;The final meal of the day&quot;\n</code></pre></div>",
