Looking at the timezone of your profile you're located in the US, and as such you a) may have to implement CDA for legal/financial reasons, b) you may have to implement it because all partners whom you exchange data with support CDA. Assuming one gets to choose an interoperability standard  without looking at what others are using is probably not a good idea.<br>\nIn general CDA is much more mature than FHIR documents with equivalent clinical content, many of the clinical resources in FHIR have a low maturity level at this point in time. However, for use cases with a limited scope FHIR Documents is certainly mature enough to be used. IMHO it'll take a year or two for FHIR to have created the necessary maturity on the clinical resources for it to be truly a full equivalent/replacement for CDA documents.</p>",

(And FHIR REST tends to mean less negotiation/customization when interfacing with partners).  So I agree with Rene that if you're not constrained by communication partners, FHIR is probably the way to go.  If you need to support CDA (or more specifically C-CDA), then you might also look at supporting FHIR internally, but mapping your data to and from the C-CDA spec.  There's active work now on creating a standard set of transformations to help support this process - though there are some fuzzy areas where transformation won't be as clean/simple as we might like.</p>",
