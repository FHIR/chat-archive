Sending a masked SSN as patient identifier seems like the best option, but the flaw with that approach is that the value \"<strong>*</strong>3333\" is not actually a real value in the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-ssn\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-ssn\">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-ssn</a> code system (the real value being \"111223333\".  The alternative is sending unmasked data and relying on the client to apply masking, but then the problem becomes communicating what mask to apply (i.e. how many digits are shown, and how many should be masked). </p>\n<p>The problem I'd like to avoid is an end-user seeing a masked SSN in the EHR, and then launching a SMART-on-FHIR app and seeing the unmasked SSN there.</p>",
