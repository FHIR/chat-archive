Because of breaking changes in FHIR STU3, the new Forge STU3 release no longer supports DSTU2 profiles. Forge for DSTU2 will no longer be further developed, as all our development efforts are now focused on Forge for STU3. However you can continue to use Forge for DSTU2 for as long as you need.</p>\n<p>Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or comments.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow (Friday May 5th), the Furore FHIR team is leaving for Madrid to attend the HL7 WGM and Connecthaton. We will all be available online throughout the week, but response times may be a bit longer than usual.</p>\n<p>Happy profiling!</p>",

There is no need to include parent elements (incl. root); it is not invalid, but redundant. The FHIR API provides a snapshot generator that can generate a full tree from the sparse differential by merging all of the implied information derived from external sources (base profile, element type profiles, extension definitions).<br>\n2) Since your DocumentReference profile does not constrain the child elements, there is no need to include these element definitions in the (sparse!) differential component.<br>\nHope this explains.</p>",
