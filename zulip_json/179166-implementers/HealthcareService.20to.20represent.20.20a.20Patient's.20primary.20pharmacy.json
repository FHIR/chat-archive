I am struggling with how to associate the HealthcareService with the Patient. Our client would like to GET a single patient, and see the pharmacy list in the same API call. Would an extension on the Patient be the best way to include this? Can I use an extension that would include a list of HealthcareService resources? Any help on how to define this or an example of what the \"Patient with HealthcareServices\" would look like would be greatly helpful. Thank you!</p>",
