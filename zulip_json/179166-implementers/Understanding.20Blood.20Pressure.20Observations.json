I anticipate the answer to be \"yes\", but all the guidance given in that Profile suggests the simple NIBP (cuff-based non-invasive) use case.<br>\n2- If I want to specify whether a BP is invasive or not, do I add the LOINC code 8357-6 (blood Pressure method) as an additional component at the same level as the mandatory systolic and diastolic components?<br>\n3- Related to question #1 - to express CVP (Central venous Pressure) measurements in LOINC the most logical/straight-forward way would be to have an observation with the LOINC code 60985-9 (meaning exactly CVP) in observation.code. If, however, we are bound to follow the structure specified in the Vital Signs profile, how would the component look like that I'd need to express it's \"central \" (with the  method LOINC code you can only express it a venous line))? And in which component should I stick the actual value? (note that CVP does not specify whether it's systolic or diastolic.... or mean)</p>",

        "content": "<p>I think we need to be clear(er) on what we actually intend to achieve with the vital signs profile.  Do we actually want it to deal with measurements that are generally considered to be \"vital signs\"?  Or is it intended to be more about \"core data elements\" (or something like that)?  My point is that, in the example we are discussing, not all blood pressure measurements are intended to be used and displayed as a \"vital sign\" (i.e. a measurement that you would expect to be recorded or displayed in a vital signs flow sheet or EHR panel).  Venous blood pressures would not normally (or likely ever) be included as vital signs.  Probably standing (arterial) BP would not, either (as noted <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Fixed.20Code.20vs.20Pattern\" title=\"#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Fixed.20Code.20vs.20Pattern\">here</a> by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191687\">@Kevin Mayfield</span>).  Oxygen saturation is similar.  Not all O2 Sat measurements will likely be treated as vital signs.  When they are obtained as part of a blood gas panel from an arterial draw they aren't normally considered that way.  That's why we had a lot of discussion earlier about using the specific 59408-5 <em>Oxygen saturation in Arterial blood by Pulse oximetry</em> code rather than 2708-6 <em>Oxygen saturation in Arterial blood</em>.  We ended up compromising and going with the methodless code (consistent with the others in the profile) and we suggest that the pulse oximetry specific code can be included in addition.  But, even though I agree with the choice of the methodless code here, the reality is that at present likely all O2 Sat measurements that are treated as vital signs will be obtained via pulse oximetry.</p>\n<p>So again, in the profile do we want to cover vital signs (as that term is generally understood and used), or do we want to include all of the measurements that fall \"under\" the methodless codes that we have chosen for the profile (regardless of the reason that those measurements were obtained or how they are used and displayed)?  And when we are sure of the answer, we probably need to include some additional descriptive text in the profile that clearly explains it.</p>",

The example as a code-value pair in a (new) component is almost identical to what I had constructed myself in the first place.<br>\nI like your proposal to use Observation.method. It sounds very reasonable (and strikingly obvious). However I fail to see where to stick the value of the code-value pair. In other words, I think it suffers from the same issue as the two other solutions proposed by Lloyd (as I explained ~ 3 messages above). I guess way out could be to invent and use a valueset to avoid having to use a code-value pair...</p>",

Not all O2 Sat measurements will likely be treated as vital signs.  When they are obtained as part of a blood gas panel from an arterial draw they aren't normally considered that way.  That's why we had a lot of discussion earlier about using the specific 59408-5 <em>Oxygen saturation in Arterial blood by Pulse oximetry</em> code rather than 2708-6 <em>Oxygen saturation in Arterial blood</em>.  We ended up compromising and going with the methodless code (consistent with the others in the profile) and we suggest that the pulse oximetry specific code can be included in addition.  But, even though I agree with the choice of the methodless code here, the reality is that at present likely all O2 Sat measurements that are treated as vital signs will be obtained via pulse oximetry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm sorry for coming very late to this discussion, and I realise this choice has probably been made and would be difficult to reverse at this point. However, I'm worried about the decision to use 2708-6 <em>Oxygen saturation in Arterial blood</em> instead of 59408-5 <em>Oxygen saturation in Arterial blood by Pulse oximetry</em> for the oximetry profile. Looking at the class, 2708-6 is considered CHEM, ie chemistry. This is likely a code that is used for oxygen saturation blood gas results, obtained by analysing arterial blood by direct methods (S<em>a</em>O2). I'm worried about the potential mixups between this and oxygen saturation measurements obtained by peripheral observations by indirect methods (S<em>p</em>O2). Have these issues been discussed somewhere else?</p>",
