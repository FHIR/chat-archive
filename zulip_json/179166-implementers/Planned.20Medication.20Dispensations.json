The List would include entries of type MedicationRequest. Ideally we would also do some profiling on the MedicationRequest entries adapting them for the dispensation use case (not sure if you can bind specific profiles of the entry resources to the List.code value?).</p>\n<p><strong>Option 2 - Medication Request</strong><br>\nUse the MedicationRequest resource directly without a list. We would probably have a profile specifically for adapting the MedicationRequest to the dispensation use case as well. </p>\n<p>Maybe there are other better options?</p>\n<p>Any recommendations of how to in the best way expose planned dispensations?</p>",

Sounds like a better place for the question! :) </p>\n<p>Reason for considering List is that it is used for a \"Medication List\", where the List has a code=medications, and then includes List.entry.item with references to MedicationStatement. I guess this could be achieved by just getting MedicationStatements for a patient directly? So, we thought one option could be to go for another type of list. </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191832\">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span>, the MedicationRequest has a section for dispenseRequest which to me seems would support this use case. But I havent looked into it in detail yet. And I have never come across the SupplyRequest resource, will absolutely have a look into that!
