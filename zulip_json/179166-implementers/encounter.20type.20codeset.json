I'm looking to use this to define admission types for inpatient admissions, ie maternity, nwborn, emergent, elective, etc. (essentially the data in an HL7 PV1.4 segment). Is that a valid use for this element and if so, do I just define my own codeset? <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-encounter-type.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-encounter-type.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-encounter-type.html</a> </p>",
