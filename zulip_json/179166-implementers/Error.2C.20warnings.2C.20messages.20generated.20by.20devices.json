Certainly Observation is part of the answer, and I'd point you to the MDC code system and its underlying standard, IEEE 11073-10101 (2019), which has a lot of detailed nomenclature and codes for errors, warnings, and messages from numerous specialized acute-care and personal devices. There is an extension of this standard forthcoming this year with more event codes of these kinds. There are groups working on this area in both IHE (the Devices DEV domain) and HL7 Health Care Devices (\"Devices on FHIR\"), as well as IEEE 111073 Medical Device Communications, with particular focus on device events and alerts you might want to look into or, if you like, join. Real-time handling of device events and alerts with methods including FHIR is a hot topic. Contact me (john.rhoads \"at\" <a href=\"http://philips.com\">philips.com</a>) or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192176\">@Todd Cooper</span> with questions</p>",
