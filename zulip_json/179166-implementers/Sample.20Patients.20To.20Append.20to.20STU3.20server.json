I would like some guidance on how to post a bundle of 5,000 + patients to my own server on the sandbox.hspconsortium platform. Are there any source servers that have over 5,000 patient instances already so I can use a tag uploader? Or is this something I need to \"hard-code\"? I.E. jumble the names of patients and post it to the sandbox.</p>\n<p>I'd like to have the names of patients not to be uploaded to my sample EHR more than twice as a caveat. </p>\n<p>Thank You</p>",
