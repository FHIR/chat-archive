Using that access_token your client would be able to read from your server. And of course you are also encouraged to implement SSL.</p>",

See how your data has formed the entities, the relationships, and all the stuff</p>\n<p>2. Compare your entities and fhir resources, that how your data is formed and what fhir says that how some specific data should be formed. For example, you have an entity for a purpose but fhir divided that into two resources and vice versa.</p>\n<p>3. You just need a fhir facade that will sip your data and will throw in a fhir format. For that you can consider any platform because your major problem is to fit your data to the fhir resources. So, you can also consider other platforms according to their ease of mapping your data to the fhir.</p>\n<p>4. You can read the spec and write your facade or you can avail some opensource or commercial products for that. kindly refer to this page <a href=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Publicly_Available_FHIR_Servers_for_testing\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Publicly_Available_FHIR_Servers_for_testing\">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Publicly_Available_FHIR_Servers_for_testing</a></p>",
