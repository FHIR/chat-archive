For paging purposes I return 20 in the Bundle and provide links to get next/previous etc. Now in theory I have that set tracked so that in a few minutes a request for page 2 comes in, I can go to that set and get the next page from the set. My question is how long do I have to keep track of that set identity? Do I need to be able to respond to page 2 request tomorrow, next week, next month... Also if my track of the request has expired, what is the correct response when I can no longer fill a page request (because I forgot the set)?</p>",
