I am trying to map a structure where the Patient occurs first and then, much later on, an AllergyIntolerance needs to be created and I need to get the reference to the Patient resource created earlier.  The only solution (since FML doesn't allow me to make variables) seems to be to wrap my maps after Patient inside context and pass the Patient into my groups.  That seems yucky, but I can't see any other way around.</p>",
