Please advise, thanks.<br>\nI need to display a body image on an electronic form, let the user marks different parts of body to indicate pain points, upon which user will submit the eform with the marked body image.  This image needs to be re-display for changes or review.  <br>\nResource ImagingStudy is for DICOM which is not quite the body image that I need to work on.</p>",
