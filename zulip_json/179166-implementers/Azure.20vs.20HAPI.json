Instead, I would look at the maturity of the products, the features and resources they support, roadmap, support, pricing, maintenance, integration (for instance, currently Azure FHIR API can be integrated with Azure AD) and so on...., on the other hand the MSFT-Team provides also the FHIR server on github where developer can enhance the code and provide other / more features.</p>",
