        "content": "<p>Hi, we just implemented a webapp client that successfully connects to a hapi fhir server and stores answers. Now we wonder if there's a better workflow by generating client code from a Questionaire Source. I saw <a href=\"https://lhcformbuilder.nlm.nih.gov/\">https://lhcformbuilder.nlm.nih.gov/</a>.  Another Question is how can we use QuestionnaireBuilder from HAPI FHIR,  if  its useful for our case? Are there more useful tools available, maybe for other types of clients? We need to deliver an overview of possible tools &amp; workflows for a college work. Thank you in advance! Peter ps does anybody have exerience with lhcforms (<a href=\"https://github.com/lhncbc/formbuilder-lhcforms\">https://github.com/lhncbc/formbuilder-lhcforms</a>)? does it work well?</p>",
