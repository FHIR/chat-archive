I am assuming that the id is not known because that is created by the server and one must obtain the Patient resource by some means to find the logical id. In the PHD patient profile the only required entries (besides the meta.profile) is the identifier, as that can be an opaque but unique way of defining a patient. The dictionary that maps the identifier to a human being is known only to authorized personnel. It would seem like a search on a Patient identifier would need to be mandatory.</p>",
