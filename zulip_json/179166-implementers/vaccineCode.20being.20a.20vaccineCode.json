After some analysis in the UK, we've found that a lot of systems record immunizations as a completed procedure, rather than holding the actual vaccine used. So for example a system might hold a record that a patient has had (in SNOMED) 247641000000105 | Second pneumococcal conjugated vaccination (procedure) |. This causes an issue trying to use the immunization resource, as within Immunizations the vaccineCode is mandated.<br>\nIs there a recommended approach to interoperate this data? - some options might be<br>\nShould we use a procedure resource - this takes away from the immunization-ness of the data?<br>\nShould we just put the procedure code in vaccineCode - this seems to break the resource?<br>\nShould we create an extension for the procedure &amp; put a \"Not Known\" in the vaccineCode?</p>\n<p>Any help appreciated</p>",
