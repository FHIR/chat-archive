In the DeviceComponents the latest update has the identifier cardinality 0..* instead of 1..1 which I went ahead and used. Those errors I understood. But now its not coming up except where I expected it. I think the problem may have been when I put in fake placeholder URLs that were 'correct' at least in format, I removed the old resources from the package and added the new ones. However, looking at the implementation guide xml, the old resource urls were still present. I manually deleted them and that may have caused the error to go away.</p>",
