If a client makes a query with an identifier that doesn't match that format, should the response code be an error (4xx) as the identifier format is wrong or 200, as the search format was correct - just that the identifier was malstructured. In either case an OO can give the details of the issue...   <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#errors\">This section</a> seems to imply a 403, but that doesn't seem quite right...</p>",
