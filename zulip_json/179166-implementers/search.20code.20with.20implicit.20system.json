Consider Patient.gender as an example, with these four possible searches:<br>\n1. /Patient?gender=male<br>\n2. /Patient?gender=|male<br>\n3. /Patient?gender=http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/administrative-gender|<br>\n4. /Patient?gender=http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/administrative-gender|male</p>\n<p>#1 is the normal way of searching this, but the others are also valid Token searches. <br>\nQuestion: should examples 2, 3 and/or 4 return results?</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"http://test.fhir.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://test.fhir.org\">test.fhir.org</a>, HAPI and Vonk they currently don't.  We are fixing this for Vonk, hence the question...<br>\nFor 2: Since the system is implicitly always defined, it may make sense that this does not return any results.<br>\nBut for 3 &amp; 4: Since the system matches the implicit system, I'd expect results.</p>\n<p>This is somewhat related to the decision about removing default values, since here the system has a 'default' value, but afaik this case is not covered by that decision.</p>",
