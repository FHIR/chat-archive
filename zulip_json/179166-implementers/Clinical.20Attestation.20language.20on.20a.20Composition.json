The direction we are planning on is to have the report be a document bundle with a Composition that points to sections that have MeasureReport resources for each measure that was run to identify a care gap. The concern we have is that the documentation for Composition says that it has \"clinical attestation\", which in our case, since the report is being built by a payer, we wouldn't have. Is this an incorrect use of a FHIR Document?</p>",
