It is not the set of vaccinations/immunization recommendations for a particular patient, or the patient's current/expired vaccinations/immunizations I'm looking for, but rather what for a country the suggested vaccinations/immunizations are, i.e., patient independent, that you then can compare to what a patient actually has, taking into account their estimated travel period.  ImmunizationRecommendation.patient is 1..1 so would not work.  Clearly, once compared, the the ImmunizationRecommendation can convey that.  Similarly, ImmunizationEvaluation is covering another part of the process, so would not work either.  One could use PlanDefinition.jurisdiction = destination and PlanDefinition.action.definition into ActivityDefinition, etc., but wanted to see what profiles had done to date.
