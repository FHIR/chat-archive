The example I usually give is that the narrative for an inpatient would be different than that of an anonymized clinical trial participant, which would be different again from that of a chicken in an agricultural  veterinary system.   Narrative should expose the 'relevant' information in a format that makes it easy to consume.  Every system will need to determine what is 'relevant' and will likely need to involve end users in both making that determination as well as deciding how best to present it.</p>",
