In the differential table it states that a name should be of type HumanName and contain the fields use of type code, and family and given of type string. This is not compatible with the current definition of HumanName which has supplementary fields of type string; prefix, suffix, text and period of type Period. In the snapshot table these extra fields are included along with another field of type string, the id. Which table should we be fitting our specification to?</p>",
