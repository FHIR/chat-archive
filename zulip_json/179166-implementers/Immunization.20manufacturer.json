I know in the v2 world, there have been similar issues, mostly around relabelers (companies that purchase vaccine and then package them with the things necessary to administer the dose such as gloves and swabs). As well, it gets complicated when one company is acquired by another but maintains some level of autonomy. This may be complicated because only one manufacturer is allowed. The Public Health WG has an Immunization session planned for WGM Friday Q2 if you're available and want to come discuss further.</p>",
