The idea would be to furnish the lawyer with uniform medical data about her clients.  I was attracted to FHIR as I read about this issue of a standard medical data model.  But I am wondering about making the API calls to disparate EHR providers - there appear to be hundreds. Would I have to figure out how to make calls to Epic, eClinicalWorks, LLC , NextGen Healthcare, GE Healthcare and on and on..which I think would make the project unviable.</p>",

It's a prescription transfer service company, where there is a central government database (to collect and send patient data to), a network layer for pharmacies to connect to, and an interface layer where the user is able to access functions regarding their prescriptions. Because it's dealing with consumer health info, I would need to encode it within FHIR/HL7. I'm inquiring about how I would go about learning that encryption, and if I could use other programming languages to create the 3 layers mentioned above, and still implementing FHIR/HL7 encryption standards.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
