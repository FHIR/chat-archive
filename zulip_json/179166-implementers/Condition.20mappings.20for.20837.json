From a pop health perspective, we infer/extract conditions from 837s (although not specifically using FHIR).  It sounds like you might be asking for a new table on <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/condition-mappings.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/condition-mappings.html\">http://build.fhir.org/condition-mappings.html</a> for 837s....that could map FHIR's Condition.code = 837 HI01-2 Industry Code (for Principal Diagnosis Code, Admitting Diagnosis Code, Other Diagnosis).  When I asked Financial Management work group to publish 837 mappings for the Claim resources (<a href=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=7877\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=7877\">GF#7877</a>), the response was </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>X12 is a widely used standard - but US only. 837 has been considered in the draft and mapping is underway.  There may be IP issues however related to presenting a mapping</p>\n</blockquote>",
