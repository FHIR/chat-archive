In International Patient Summary (IPS) when we create an IPS document (not the only choice) we have separate sections for IPS Problems Section and IPS History of Past Illness Section, but both of them use the IPS profile on Condition which fixes the 'category' value to \"Problem\" (because that's what we're interested in here). It was done this way largely because of the confusion around the use of 'category' and allowing different and multiple categories wasn't felt to be useful in the IPS context (and it also may not be in others).  So with that there is no way to declare a 'category' of \"History of clinical finding in subject\".  But even if that was allowed, declaring the 'category' in that way is not intended to provide additional context for interpreting the data in Condition.code - it only serves (or should serve) to further describe the data in ways that may make it easier to search or display (or for some other reason).  We don't actually say very much about that in the documentation for Condition, though, and we probably should.  But we do say in the comments for Condition.category that \"The categorization is often highly contextual and may appear poorly differentiated or not very useful in other contexts.\"  So that at least provides a bit of a disclaimer on its use.  </p>\n<p>So if 'category' isn't really a good option, then what is the solution for the issue that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"235201\">@Ben Grey</span> describes?  We don't say a lot about it in Condition (or in IPS), but the Condition documentation does say that \"The Condition.code may also include such concepts as \"history of X\" and \"good health\", where it is useful or appropriate to make such assertions.\"  That would mean that if the desired \"history of X\" concept doesn't already exist in SNOMED CT then you would need to use a SNOMED compositional grammar expression (i.e. post-coordination) to say it or (more likely) you would need to have that concept added to an appropriate SNOMED CT extension until it could potentially be promoted to the International Edition.  The only other real alternative that I can think of that might make sense is to interpret the 'onset' and 'abatement' values to determine whether a particular Condition resource should be considered as current or historical (I think that would need to be tested to see if it actually would work).</p>",

There are now some terminology servers available that can support this, and as that becomes more prevalent and people become aware of it the situation might possibly begin to change.  But at present it seems that nearly all implementations avoid it (like the plague).   We do intend to focus the Terminology Track efforts at the Connectathon in Atlanta this time on implementation of SNOMED CT in particular, and we will try to use that opportunity to more fully engage the participants in the other tracks around their current or desired use of SNOMED (everyone needs terminology, and many or most likely need SNOMED CT), including raising awareness of possibilities with post-coordination.  I think many of us working with SNOMED have always assumed that we would get there - sometime.  And now could be a time to begin trying to inch forward on it.</p>",

Because of the big diversity of patient's complaints and medical history /and it differs depending on whether the current illness is chronic or acute condition/, it is really hard for me to prepare a template for current and past medical history.
