For days now I start the download and sometime in the estimated 6.5h the download fails (it's not a bandwidth issue on my end). Are there any alternate ways of obtaining this file? Thanks! (I asked first on #inferno but it's a bit quite there)</p>",

You can no longer access the files using the username/password login.  You now have to authenticate instead using one of the <a href=\"https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/login?service=https:%2F%2Fdownload.nlm.nih.gov%2Fumls%2Fkss%2FIHTSDO20210131%2FSnomedCT_InternationalRF2_PRODUCTION_20210131T120000Z.zip\">identity providers</a>, so if you don't have that set up yet that may be the issue.  If the issue isn't the authentication, then I'm not sure what it would be.  I typically download SNOMED CT, rather than the Metathesaurus, but I haven't had any problems in doing that.  Of course, the Metathesaurus download is substantially larger (5.0 GB compared to 502 MB), but I wouldn't expect it to be taking  &gt; 6 hours.</p>",
