I can think of a few other examples of resources owned by Patient Care that deal with patient-reported dates/ages that are often without date/time precision, such as  FamilyMemberHistory.age and estimatedAge, AllergyIntolerance.onset, and Condition.onset.  It seems reasonable that Procedure has comparable capabilities (expressing estimated dates, ages, etc.) for these patient procedure statements.</p>",
