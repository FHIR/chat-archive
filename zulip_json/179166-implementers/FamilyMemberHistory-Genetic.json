In FamilyMemberHistory-Genetic the attribute born from FamilyMemberHistory is renamed to bornage. But the name does not adapt to the type as with born. They are still called bornPeriod, bornDate, bornString. Is this a mistake in the documentation or do the old names remain? Another question is: why are the attributes renamed depending on their type.<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/familymemberhistory-genetic.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/familymemberhistory-genetic.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/familymemberhistory-genetic.html</a></p>",
