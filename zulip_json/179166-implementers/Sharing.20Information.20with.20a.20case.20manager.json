Meaning, there is already a formal way in HL7 to define an Implementation Guide, what is the role for 'informative appendix'? I am struggling with the rule that would be used to decide what is worthy of an 'informative appendix' vs what goes through some other mechanism. There are plenty of blogged solutions, why is this one special? -- or are you just looking for a way to gather for the readership these plethora of blogged solutions (blogs hold much other noise)? How might we nominate an article? How might it be chosen or rejected? --- Please don't get the wrong impression, this is good stuff, and good question. I just want to understand the impact and opportunity.</p>",
