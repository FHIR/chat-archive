The base repo uses cognito and roles based access control and the smart branch uses attribute based access control. You can also implement your own authz by implementing the Authorization interface found here <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-interface/blob/mainline/src/authorization.ts\">https://github.com/awslabs/fhir-works-on-aws-interface/blob/mainline/src/authorization.ts</a>.</p>",
