I'll ask my question here but if there is a separate stream for these types of questions I'll move my discussion there.   (I noticed that there is a session at FHIR DevDays on this,  yeh!)</p>\n<p>My question has to do with mapping of HL7 RDE (Pharm Order) messages to the FHIR MedicationRequest resource, specifically how do people map the timing information, e.g. from the RXE-1 field?    I do not see an obvious mapping of the RXE-1.4 (Start Date/time) and RXE-1.5 (End Date/time) to something in the MedicationRequest.   I suspect it would logically get mapped to the dosageInstructions.timing property but the FHIR Timing data type doesn't seem to have a way to represent this?</p>",
