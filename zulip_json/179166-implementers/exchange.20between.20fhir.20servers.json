What is the best practice for getting data from one FHIR server and posting/putting it to another orgs FHIR server? For example, if one organization needs to report information about a patient, including demographics and observations, from an EHR to an outcomes research organization, how are IDs handled? e.g., do I GET a Patient, remove the id, and POST it to another orgs FHIR server? should the id be preserved somehow? perhaps as a new identifer? preserve it in provenance somehow?</p>",
