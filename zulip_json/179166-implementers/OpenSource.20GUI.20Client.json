Its not open-source i guess . I am looking for FHIR Client like this with read , update , patch , search functionality . Are there any GUI for FHIR that is up to date ? I found clinFHIR client on github but only the search part .<br>\nI have a presentation coming on FHIR Server I need a versatile GUI like wildfhir that i can demonstrate from localhost .</p>",
