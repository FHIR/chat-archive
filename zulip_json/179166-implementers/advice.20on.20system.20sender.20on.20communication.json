I have a system that autogenerates and stores FHIR communication (STU3) messages and I'm in the need for efficiently modelling the fact that the system itself is the sender of information. Up until now, I've used a contained Device as sender, but now my clients would like to search or filter on Communication resources that are NOT these system generated messages. I've considered to use tag  instead, but that has other limitations. Should I really bite the apple and create and store a Device that represents the system?</p>",
