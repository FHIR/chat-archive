        "content": "<p>Hey all--while looking through the Care Team Organizer and Care Team Member templates in Appendix A of the Companion Guide, we noticed that Epic documents authorship at the level of individual care team members, not really at the level of an entire care team. Right now, we figure that if we need to send a single care team-level author, the most appropriate person to send is whoever most recently updated the patient's care team.</p>\n<p>In theory, we can figure that the most recent person to update the care team is implicitly attesting to the accuracy of every member of a patient's care team besides just the ones they've added. In practice, though, this might not be true all the time (especially if a user is only focused on some specialty aspect of a patient's care), and so including authorship for adding individual providers to a patient's care team (within the Care Team Member Act instead of the organizer) is likely to be more accurate. The downside is that the Act template doesn't mention any author info, so I don't know how well anyone receiving it would be able to handle it if we put it there.</p>\n<p>Does anyone on here have any opinions on which approach to take? Unless folks think that sending member-level authorship is a good idea even though it's not called out in the Companion Guide, we'll probably stick to sending a single author for the entire care team.</p>",
