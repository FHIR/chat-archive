The simplest way for someone to come up with the query is to indicate that they want a new search, select the FHIR project, select all 4 issue types, select \"More\" and choose \"Specification\" and then select from the dropdown.  The need to choose project=FHIR first is because the set of specs varies by project.  The need to select the 4 issue types first is because the plugin we use to allow the list of specifications to be dynamically adjusted based on what's committed to JiraSpecArtifacts wants it that way and I've found no way to get around it.</p>",
