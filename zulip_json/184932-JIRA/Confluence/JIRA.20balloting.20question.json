Given voters can vote on other people's issues and  that a lot of comments come in towards the end of the ballot period, it seems like it might be inefficient to close issues before the ballot ends (others may have the same concerns but different use cases or points of view). Will it be a best practice for WGs to not resolve issues during the ballot period?</p>",

The way to add perspective is to comment on the issue.  I, personally, have not seen an upsurge in people commenting on existing issues during the ballot period, so it's not clear there's any reason to treat that period of time differently from any other.</p>",
