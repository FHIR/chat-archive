But this seems to require that the Resolution must also be changed to the same value. In my block I have some Persuasive, some Persuasive with Mod, and some Not Persuasive with Mod.  I can do a 3 Bulk Changes for each proposed resolution, but this seems odd. Is there no support for bulk change where the resolution status has already been specified?</p>",
