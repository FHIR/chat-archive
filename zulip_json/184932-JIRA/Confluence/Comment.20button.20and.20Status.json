We don't allow comments to be attached to anything that's been fully actioned because, typically, no one ever looks at those tracker items again.  If you have a concern/question/correction, it should either be raised on <a href=\"http://chat.fhir.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://chat.fhir.org\">chat.fhir.org</a> or some other discussion forum, or - if you think further changes are needed - by raising a new change request and including a pointer to the original.  While people who are subscribed to monitor that particular task could receive an email because your comment was added, it's not guaranteed anyone would.  And even if they did, such emails often get lost in a blizzard and never seen/acted upon.</p>",
