Do you mean \"search for all things that have a negative vote recorded against them\"?  If so, we don't have that (yet).  We do have this: <code>issueFunction in InBallot(\"2019-Sep - FHIR IG CDex R1 STU\", \"NEG\")</code> which lets you find those issues that have outstanding negative votes for the specified ballot.  If need be, I could possibly modify that function so it could just take InBallot(\"NEG\") or possibly even InBallot() which could find all issues that were referenced in a ballot of some sort whether affirmative or negative.  Let me know what you'd actually use and I'll see what I can do...</p>",
