So the CP is to move from using local valueSet resources in the FHIR core, to using by reference to URI of the valueSets published by DICOM. So there is no functional change, and it sets us up to be following any changes they make to their own valueSets.  Hence why I am not thinking there is any value to having the workgroup vote.<br>\nSee <a href=\"http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-24908\">J#24908</a></p>",
