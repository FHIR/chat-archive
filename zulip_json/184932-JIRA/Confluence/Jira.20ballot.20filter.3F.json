Sorry this has taken so long.  I finally have a function that will provide a list of issues that are tied to ballot comments.  It works like this:<br>\n<code>issueFunction in InBallot(\"2019-Sep - FHIR IG CDex R1 STU\")</code></p>\n<p>That will return all of the FHIR (and eventually other product family) issues that are referred to by the specified ballot.  (You can see the ballot codes either in the BALDEF records or in the BALLOT records).  You can add additional filters such as status, submitter, grouping and other things too if you like - It acts as a filter on the list of issues like any other filter.</p>\n<p>I hope to have a variant of the function that allows you to filter to only those things that have negative votes or 'open' (i.e. non-withdrawn) votes, but that's still a work in progress.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192302\">@May Terry</span> I'll next be working on a ballot reconciliation spreadsheet export that should give you everything you're looking for.</p>",
