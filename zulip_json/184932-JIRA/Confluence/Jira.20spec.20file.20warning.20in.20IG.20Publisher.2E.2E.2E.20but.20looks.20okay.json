The only difference is that the suggested file omits the <em>specification @gitUrl</em> attribute.</p>\n<p>I don't see any debugging details about this in the IG Publisher output. Any thoughts on how to troubleshoot this? Or can I ignore the warning if the IG artifacts are showing up okay in Jira (they seem to be)?<br>\nThx</p>",
