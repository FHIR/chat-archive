We use the Grouping's to manage this today, but I wonder if a status would be better?</p>",

I suppose it is once you figure out the right pattern, but there are some tricks to it that must be applied to every query and filter you setup. Ultimately, preparing something for a vote seems like a key part of the overall workflow, so therefore having a status just makes sense to me. I have worked in plenty of change control systems (almost all of them actually) that are configured with a status that clearly says \"hey everyone, this is ready to review\" rather than needing to interpret it by looking at other meta data. It could also be used as an additional validation point as we try to improve our usage of JIRA.</p>\n<p>But if I am the only one who thinks so, and it is very possible that I am, it isn't worth a large amount of work.</p>",
