Commenters did a good job filling in the \"<code>Related Section(s)</code>\" attribute and I manually cleaned up the rest. I'd like to see the values used in this field for all issues in the ballot / specification in order to categorize (and delegate) issue resolution/work. Is this possible/reasonable?</p>\n<p>In SQL, this would be a <code>group by</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, here's all the issues with a \"<code>Related Section(s)</code>\" of \"Conformance\" <br>\n<code>project = FHIR AND Specification = \"FHIRCast (FHIR) [FHIR-fhircast]\" AND \"Related Section(s)\" ~ \"Conformance\" </code></p>",

The only fields that are defined as drop-downs based on specification are \"Related Page(s)\" and \"Related Artifact(s)\" - and those weren't terribly well populated historically for IGs because you were stuck with the dropdowns from core.</p>",
