We also have a couple of teams working on things, and they need a way to publish things that's somewhere between Zulip and our own personal/corporate blogs.</p>\n<p>Today <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"251396\">@John Keyes</span> wondered if the PE WG Confluence page can contain multiple blogs, or if the one blog can be split to sub-blog, so each team's work can be selectively displayed. In response I wondered if the posts can have categories or tags, like <a href=\"https://www.epatientdave.com/category/fhir/\">my site's FHIR category</a>. But I don't see a tags or category feature, and the Confluence [help page on blog posts[(<a href=\"https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/blog-posts-834222533.html\">https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/blog-posts-834222533.html</a>) doesn't mention one.  Any ideas?</p>",

While Confluence cannot have \"multiple blogs\" per space it will allow the attachment of labels to a blog post. Then, on a Confluence page/page-tree a blog-post macro can be setup and parameterized to listen for specific labels. Here is a sample of what the blog label section looks like: <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/yfpmt4T9nZ2SBDepfBN_TbGA/image.png\">image.png</a> <br>\nHere is an example of the macro listener on a Confluence page: <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/KlpyAWhtzDzIBVUQhVGCup59/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/yfpmt4T9nZ2SBDepfBN_TbGA/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/yfpmt4T9nZ2SBDepfBN_TbGA/image.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/KlpyAWhtzDzIBVUQhVGCup59/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/KlpyAWhtzDzIBVUQhVGCup59/image.png\"></a></div>",

Anyway, for future visitors to this thread, I'll note that the selected label appears at end of post, and clicking it will (I presume) bring up others with that label. That's what we need, especially since we can share the label's URL with interested parties to help them find the relevant content: <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/label/PE/experiments\">https://confluence.hl7.org/label/PE/experiments</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/WFwjVDUhsbzC1EAc4kh1uSJ-/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/WFwjVDUhsbzC1EAc4kh1uSJ-/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/WFwjVDUhsbzC1EAc4kh1uSJ-/image.png\"></a></div>",
