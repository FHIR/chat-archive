To filter by artifacts or pages, you need project, issue type <em>and</em> specification selected.  (I believe this is covered in the documentation.  If you can't find it, holler and I'll update.)</p>\n<p>For example, this query gives me 320 hits:<br>\n<code>project = FHIR AND issuetype in (\"Change Request\", Comment, Question, \"Technical Correction\") AND Specification = \"Genomics Reporting (FHIR) [FHIR-genomics-reporting]\"</code></p>",
