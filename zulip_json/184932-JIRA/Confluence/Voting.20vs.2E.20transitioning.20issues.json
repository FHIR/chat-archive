Once you have a vote you should always be transitioning the issue to Resolved - Change Required, Resolved - No Change, etc.  To help with this, I've removed the ability to specify a vote and date when using the \"propose a resolution\" screen - so you'll always have to open the desired transition screen in order to specify a vote.  However, if doing a bulk change, you'll still need to remember to perform the transition once the votes have been filled in.</p>\n<p>Also, a reminder that you may need to 'move' the issue to the appropriate category before resolving.  If something is a question, you can't find it persuasive or non-persuasive without first moving it to be a change request.  Similarly if you determine that a technical correction is substantive, it must also be moved to be a change request.</p>\n<p>If there are any questions/issues, please let me know.</p>",
