Any issues submitted against that specification that have a URL must have the URL based in one of those two locations.  The tooling enforces this so that people actually log issues against the right spec.  The fact that SMART 'moved' is what's causing the issue.  </p>\n<p>You have the power to edit the issue to change the URL to the proper place in the 'current' spec, which is the simplest way to address the problem.  I'm somewhat loath to add an \"alternate\" URL because it is going to mean code tweaks in quite a few places, so it's only worthwhile if we expect this is going to be a common occurrence.  (It's also something I'd really rather not mess with close to ballot close...)  Do you think the \"update the URL or ask someone else to do it for you\" approach is viable?</p>",
