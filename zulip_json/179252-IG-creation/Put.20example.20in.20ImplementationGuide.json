It would be a big job to convert that Bundle to xml by hand; never mind the chance for error. Of course there might be a tool to do that but xml is often full of attributes so its hard to know how to do in general I would assume.</p>\n<p>I am wondering if it is the Bundle that's the problem....</p>",
