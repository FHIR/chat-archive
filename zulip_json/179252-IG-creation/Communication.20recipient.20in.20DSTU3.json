In Forge it is actually possible to add the CareTeam type as a recipient option, but once I try to set a CareTeam as a recipient on HAPI FHIR (release 3.8) on a new Communication instance, I get this error:</p>\n<p>Failure during REST processing: ca.uhn.fhir.rest.server.exceptions.UnprocessableEntityException: Invalid reference found at path 'Communication.recipient'. Resource type 'CareTeam' is not valid for this path</p>\n<p>So it seems that HAPI FHIR doesn't support what Forge lets me profile.</p>\n<p>Any advise on how to allow Communication.recipient to include a CareTeam?</p>",
