Specially defined or required SearchParamters need to show up in the capabilityStatement and the IG, but how about FHIR pre-defined parameters that an implementer may want to include in their implementation? Are those or should those be included in the capabilityStatement in some way? If it is included in the CapabilityStatement, what should the definition url be? Is there a canonical URL for R4 standard defined SearchParameters or does an IG have to \"redefine\" all of them?</p>",
