One special case is extensions, where there's a requirement that if you expose an extension in an instance, the receiver must be able to find the definition of that extension.  The <em>easiest</em> way to make that happen is for the extension URL resolve.  However, putting the extension in a common public registry, or pre-negotiation in a closed community can also achieve the objective.</p>",
