At the moment the page is very developmental, so it may yet be restructured etc. But you should all check that your LOINC and SNOMED CT copyright statements are correct, and this page is the most convenient way to do this.</p>\n<p>Note that this page is also generated for affiliate IGs; we'll have to discuss the degree to which this is appropriate or not. It does not apply to IGs created by other organizations, though it may also be appropriate to do the license analysis for them too - they sill have to comply to code system licensing requirements</p>",
