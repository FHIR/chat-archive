Is it possible to specify a relative path for asset and page locations?</p>\n<p>We're trying to make our IG available under an ig/ route on our website, but it looks like all of the asset and page paths are hard coded to /assets/, whereas we'd like them to be ig/assets/. Is there a way to specify a path prefix for the publisher to use?</p>",

If I use the publisher as is, I get all of my resources generated in a single folder with the URL, this works fine when serving from directory (e.g. links to toc.html work correctly). My issue is that we're serving our IG under a different path /ig. Which means that links to toc.html should point to localhost:3000/ig/toc.html, but instead they point to the server root localhost:3000/toc.html. It's the same for all generated StructureDefinitions and such.</p>\n<p>So I guess my question is, am I doing something incorrect that is causing the paths to be generated incorrectly?</p>",
