In restructuring and rebuilding the IPS IG last night and today with Publisher 1.1.72 I found that it is now hanging for a very long time at \"Validating Conformance Resources\".  Adding some further logging it showed that the hangup was on lines like <code>$batch validate for 5039 codes on systems [http://snomed.info/sct]</code>.  The batches of ~5000 concepts are taking ~20-30 min. each.  And I haven't gotten to the end yet with the largest one, for the full SNOMED CT GPS, which is ~26,000 codes - I'm expecting to see that one is going to take at least 3 hours or so (and I'm in progress with it right now).  This wasn't happening until very recently (possibly starting with 1.1.72 - I didn't see it with any earlier versions but I could have skipped one or two).  And it's really a completely impractical and intractable issue.  It seems that we need either some way to be able speed up this process on <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a>, or a way to selectively turn it off when needed - or something.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span>?</p>",
