I may have to redo that one given the latest changes to the publisher. AND this script is intended to be used with some process around this - i.e. making a release is a formal process that needs humans. Even if the release build is automated to save some work</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks for the input <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191832\">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191427\">@Jens Villadsen</span> <br>\nWe are currently testing a new release process for the HL7 Norway released profiles. Currently we release things through SIMPLIFIER, but they are not perfectly integrated in the HL7 release process. I think the only place we show up is in the package registry. Everything else is strictly manual labour. We would want to establish a more automated build and release process for our IG's that integrate better with what the rest of HL7 and affiliates are doing.</p>\n<p>We will consider both a tailored process based on GitHub actions, but also just using the auto-ig builder like <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> suggests as I am not sure we need all the flexibility of a tailored process. However, some of the IG's published by vendors and healthcare organizations in Norway could benefit from a more \"lax\" build/publish process. It is quite a learning curve for us that have grown accustomed to the SIMPLIFIER process however. </p>\n<p>Sorry for all the stupid questions. Grahame was right, removing the <em>-publish</em> (undocumented?) option on the IG publisher command line did the trick, and without this set, the content of the publish box and link to a history page is back. I am still not sure how to get the correct content into the publish box for a published release build, as I find the documentation on this part of the process rather confusing.</p>",
