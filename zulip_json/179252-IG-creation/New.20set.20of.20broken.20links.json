The first guide that I run it against now has a bevy of missing links that don't appear to make sense:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>The link &#39;http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/bundle.html#Bundle.link&#39; for &quot;link (Bundle)&quot; cannot be resolved\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The file referenced has the following links at the line number that is referenced:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;a href=&quot;StructureDefinition-EstablishmentRequestBundle-definitions.html#Bundle.entry.resource&quot; title=&quot;The Resource for the entry. The purpose/meaning of the resource is determined by the Bundle.type.&quot;&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;Bundle.entry.resource&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>So a) I didn't change anything and these \"broken links\" weren't broken before and b) when I bring up the referenced page and go to the element for this line, the link works just fine.</p>\n<p>Given the repeating nature of \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/\">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/</a>\" I'm wondering if there is a parameter that I have set wrong or if this is just a error in the link checker.</p>",
