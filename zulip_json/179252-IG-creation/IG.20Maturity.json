This minimalism view is all that we can manage manually, but it might be the right level of exposure. For example we didn't expose query parameter maturity or element within a resource maturity; which is important overall but too noisy. Too much and the maturity values start to become intrusive, and a distraction. Ultimately when the IG goes normative all things that it relies on will be normative, so the resulting specification would not have maturity listed at all (exceptions are possible).</p>",
