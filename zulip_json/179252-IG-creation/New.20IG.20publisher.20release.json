I removed a section of the code from the HTML link validator that was doing some weird crosss-version checking of links against dependent IGs.  I can't remember of figure out what is trying to allow, and the way it was doing things is no longer possible now that the tools have transited to the NPM package server at <a href=\"http://packages.fhir.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://packages.fhir.org\">http://packages.fhir.org</a>.</p>\n<p>So it's possible that you'll find newly broken links with this release. I ran about 15 IGs, and couldn't find any, so maybe it'll never happen. If you see new broken links pertaining to IGs that your IG depends on, let me know</p>",
