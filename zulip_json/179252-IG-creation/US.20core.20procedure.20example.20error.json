But first we have to make sure that we have identified usable (hopefully optimal) source file(s).  I'm stating that as plural, as my prior experience with ICD flavors is that multiple files have usually been required and need to be combined appropriately to do the transformation.  Technically ICD-10-PCS isn't really \"ICD-10\", but the source files may fall into a similar pattern.  We'll have to check that out.  Then we'll want the transformation (hopefully) to be a reasonably reproducible and not too tedious process that can be used for needed future maintenance.  When we're at that point if you want to help to create that process, that's great.</p>",
