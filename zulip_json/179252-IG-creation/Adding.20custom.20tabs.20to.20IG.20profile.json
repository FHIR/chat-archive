I found a way to add tabs, but for specific page generation, I'm not able to find the logic e.g. generate patient.operations.html page. Can someone guide me on how exactly that template is generated from those scripts. I am not able to find the starting point. <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/zeI5oqPyoldU0LsO3TW8xX0q/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/zeI5oqPyoldU0LsO3TW8xX0q/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/zeI5oqPyoldU0LsO3TW8xX0q/image.png\"></a></div>",
