The history page tab shows a 404 error on it: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/history.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/history.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/history.html</a>.  I've heard that this resolves once the IG is moved to production (on <a href=\"http://hl7.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org\">hl7.org</a>).  Question...is this expected behavior for a first time published IG without prior history?  If not, what should I fix in my config (ig.json or other) to resolve this?</p>",
