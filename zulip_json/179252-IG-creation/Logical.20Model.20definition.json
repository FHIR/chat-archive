I could not get the Logical Model to validate unless I specified \"Resource\" as its base-class.  Does that make it a resource? And what did I do wrong here?<br>\nStructureDefinition.type is 1..1, the valueset is FHIRDefinedType, but it is Extensible and it is defined as \"Either a resource or datatype, including logical model types\"? So why does the validator fail here?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mine are like this</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>  &lt;kind value=&quot;logical&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;abstract value=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;type value=&quot;BeAddiction&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;baseDefinition value=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;derivation value=&quot;specialization&quot; /&gt;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>(just to split from the track for LM instances)</p>",
