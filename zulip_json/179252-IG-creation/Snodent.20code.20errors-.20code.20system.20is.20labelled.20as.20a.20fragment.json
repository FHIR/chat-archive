If HL7 publications include SNODENT codes that are NOT in the authorized set then that IS a problem.   Could be either of two things:  either we don't have permission and need to seek it, or the terminology has been updated and these are new and what is in UTG needs to be updated properly.   Not sure who is the right person to check this...</p>",
