        "content": "<p>On Wednesday, the FMG adopted a new policy that we'd been talking about for a while.  Specifically:<br>\n- Approval to take an implementation guide to ballot as STU and to publish as STU will typically require that the content be at least at FMM 2.  I.e. The content must have been tested at a connectathon or equivalent with at least 3 independently developed systems interoperating across most of the specification content that's being balloted at STU level.<br>\n- Projects wishing to ballot as STU without meeting this expectation will need to provide justification as to why getting initial implementation experience prior to balloting is infeasible<br>\n- In cases where some of the content has been tested and some not, it will be possible to ballot IG content at mixed levels - i.e. some content at STU and other content still as draft.<br>\n- Balloting as \"for comment\" is still possible with un-tested content, but the expectation is that \"for comment\" ballots will only occur when there are specific questions the work group has for the broader community that they can't get answers to without making use of the ballot process.</p>\n<p>The balloting and publication checklists have been updated to reflect the policy.</p>\n<p>If there are any questions/concerns/issues, please let your FMG representative (or me) know.</p>",
