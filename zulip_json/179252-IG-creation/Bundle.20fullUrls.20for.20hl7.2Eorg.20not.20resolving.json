This seems expected- and sounds like it has been raised previously in the context of an IG publisher bug- as an issue with <a href=\"http://hl7.org\">hl7.org</a> and not an issue with the content of the Bundle fullUrls. QA page is <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cancer-reporting/qa.html#_scratch_ig-build-temp-DLKYIU_repo_input_resources_bundle_cancer-us-pathology-message-bundle\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cancer-reporting/qa.html#_scratch_ig-build-temp-DLKYIU_repo_input_resources_bundle_cancer-us-pathology-message-bundle</a>. Tried looking for this issue in an existing thread (to be able to reference) but not finding anything, which is surprising. I'd like to include these errors in the Suppressed warnings file with this note.</p>",
