I can see that the code system is present in <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a>, but it is the original version published as part of the spec. I can also see that there is a terminology service option to the publisher, but it's documented as only working with <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a> right now. Is there a way to get the publisher to make use of the updated code systems in THO?</p>",
