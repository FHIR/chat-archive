Is there a way to reference the Questionnaire included in the IG?</p>",

That means that it needs to be in the same IG that contains the QuestionnaireResponse or in one of the IG's dependencies.  We <em>could</em> also specify a server the validator is to search for stuff it can't find in the referenced packages, but I don't think that's a feature yet.</p>",
