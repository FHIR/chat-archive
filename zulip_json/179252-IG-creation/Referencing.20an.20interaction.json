We can already specify an action to call an operation by using the canonical URL of the OperationDefinition to be called, but there is no OperationDefinition for the restful-interactions. I took a stab at an \"implied\" operation definition like this: <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/OperationDefinition/Patient-create</code>; Grahame suggested the URL should be <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/restful-interaction#create</code>, which makes sense, but how should we specify that it's a <code>Patient</code> create, not any create?</p>",
