If I need to update or remove the example, it's easy-peasy if name/description are embedded in it.  But if name/description are in the IG, I need to remember to go there and update/delete that too.</li>\n<li>I can't flub it up by mis-typing the example reference (e.g., ${type}/${id}) in the IG file.</li>\n<li>It's consistent w/ how it works for other resources in the IG (e.g., the conformance resources all have name/description embedded).</li>\n<li>It allows the IG to remain as slim as possible.  We recommend that IGs include <em>lots</em> of examples.  This makes the IG much larger and more unwieldy.  IMO, a more concise IG file (or sushi-config.yaml file, in SUSHI's case) is easier to manage.</li>\n</ul>",

For example, it would <em>disallow</em> the <em>description</em> extension on <code>Goal</code> because <code>Goal</code> has a field called <code>description</code> -- but <code>Goal</code> is not a conformance or terminology resource and its <code>description</code> is obviously quite different since it is a <code>CodeableConcept</code>.
