It covers:<br>\n- how to build community consensus <br>\n- how to author an Implementation Guide - the technical process and tools<br>\n- testing your IG, and quality works <br>\n- understanding the HL7 approval process</p>\n<p>Our purpose in running this tutorial is to build the FHIR community's <br>\ncapacity to produce IGs - demand currently exceeds supply by quite a bit.</p>\n<p>The total number of attendees is limited. We are inviting expressions of <br>\ninterest to attend the tutorial. Priority will be given to attendees who<br>\nwill build our capacity. There is no cost for the tutorial (ONC is covering<br>\nthe cost - thanks); instead, we are looking for in-kind contributions to <br>\nour capacity. Note that we are not covering travel costs for this tutorial.</p>\n<p>To register your interest, send an email to <a href=\"mailto:wkubick@hl7.org\" title=\"mailto:wkubick@hl7.org\">wkubick@hl7.org</a> by Aug 17 <br>\n(COB US eastern) and explain, in 3 paragraphs or less:<br>\n- your previous experience with FHIR, implementations, and IG creation<br>\n- which organizations in the FHIR community you have worked with<br>\n- how your participation will increase our capacity to build IGs</p>\n<p>We expect to record the tutorial and make it available, though there <br>\nwill be strong hands on aspects to the tutorial. We also plan to make<br>\nadditional follow up tutorials subsequently.</p>",
