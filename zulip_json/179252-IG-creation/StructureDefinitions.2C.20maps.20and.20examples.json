In particular, looking at the functionality around structure maps processing of these examples.  The code does seems to still be in the IG Publisher (and referenced HAPI).     Given the 2017 timestamp (and not seeing anything more recent) Is it still valid to try to handle examples + structure maps in this way?</p>",
