Ideally FPL will provide a single way to do each thing an author might need to do. So that's easier. I'd also like to see FPL simplify common patterns to make them easier (particularly common approaches to slicing).</p>\n<p>I'd also question whether FPL really needs to support every possible thing SD can support.  I'd suggest we go through the top 10 or so IGs and take inventory of the SD features they use.  It will be a subset for sure.  That's what we optimize for.  And then, <em>if necessary</em>, we provide a way to drop into a mode that's nearly like editing SD itself -- because someone will probably say it's a no-go if we can't do <em>everything</em> SD does.  But 98% of people will never use that part.  After all, we're about interoperability -- so we should probably be <em>discouraging</em> people from doing the really wacky one-off stuff anyway.</p>",

Every weird edge case that an author struggles to make work in their IG is a weird edge case that every single implementing system will also have to struggle with to be conformant.
