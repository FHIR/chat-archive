        "content": "<p>Da Vinci was having a discussion this morning that, in part, comes down to a tooling/methodology challenge.  US-Core has a specific version that's referenced in regulation.  However, newer versions can be authorized for use and, from time to time, the 'minimum' version gets moved up.  Da Vinci puts out IGs that depend on US-Core.  Ideally what we want to do is put out <em>one</em> release of each IG and allow validation against the <em>range</em> of US-Core IG versions that are 'allowed'.  E.g. it should be possible to validate against CDex version A and US-Core version B.1, B.2 or B.3.  This is technically gnarly.  Any thoughts on if/how this could be done without putting out a separate CDex release for each possible US-Core release?</p>",
