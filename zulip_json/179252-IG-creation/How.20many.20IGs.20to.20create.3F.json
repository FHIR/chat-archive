Which is appropriate depends a bit on how you want to publish and also how implementers will consume.  With one IG, you're always publishing the whole specification.  While you can limit balloting to specific subsets, when you publish, everything is subject to QA, etc.  If implementers may need to look at multiple workflows, then having everything all together is easier than having to jump around between IGs.  There's also the possibility of inconsistency if different 'workflow' IGs point to different versions of the 'resource' IG.</p>",
