Is there any guidance on this?</p>",

So, let's say we have a version of the $find-subject-variants operation in STU2, and then we ballot a new version in STU3. If someone wants to support both the STU2 and STU3 versions, should we provide guidance around the URLs? For instance, to call the STU3 version, just use '.../$find-subject-variants' and to call the STU2 version, use '.../STU2/$find-subject-variants'?</p>",
