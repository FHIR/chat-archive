However, I have created and pushed a complete copy of the ICD-10-CM code system in the tx support packages, but so far that isn't being picked up by the server (I'm working on that with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span>).  However, that is for ICD-10-CM (the US variant), <strong>not</strong> for ICD-10 (WHO) which is what you are referencing (and the code system and value set in PHIN VADS appears to, as well).  I don't yet have a full source for the complete set of codes for WHO ICD-10 (but <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191376\">@Jim Steel</span> has a ClaML parser which I think we should be able to use to get that).  But the last question is whether the PHIN VADS code system and value set <strong>should</strong> be using ICD-10, or ICD-10-CM, since as far as I know the PHIN VADS value sets are intended entirely for use in the US, and it is <strong>only</strong> ICD-10-CM that is used here.  It seems to me that PHIN VADS probably has it wrong?  And unless I'm wrong about that, you may want to go ahead and update it in the IG to ICD-10-CM (even if they haven't done that yet)?</p>",
