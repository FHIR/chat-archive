We reviewed this on the call yesterday for the HL7 IG on Basic Provenance, where I had to explain that fivews is not a component of Provenance, it does NOT include many attributes of Provenance. It is simply a cross-walk for consistency for the 'five Ws' (Who, What, Where, When, Why) without any enforcement or well defined concepts. It is getting better, but is not a formal modeling or consistency tool.</p>",
