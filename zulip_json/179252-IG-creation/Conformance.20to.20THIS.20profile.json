Specifically, I'm trying to state conformance to the profile that's being published.  Since it hasn't been published yet, the URL doesn't resolve and throws errors in the build, e.g.:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>error: URL value &#39;http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/subscriptions-backport&#39; does not resolve\nerror: URL value &#39;http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/subscriptions-backport/OperationDefinition/backport-subscriptiontopic-list&#39; does not resolve\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Are these considered an 'acceptable' errors (as they will disappear during publishing), or is there some way to indicate to publisher that those are local?</p>",
