Is it a requirement that your system must support (for some definition of MS) that profile of Patient? Is it a redundant statement?</p>\n<p>In the case of an extension with this flag set, anywhere I profile use of the extension, it becomes must support. For example, if I profile use of the <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/StructureDefinition-abatement-dateTime-uv-ips.html\">IPS Condition abatement</a> extension, on my AllergyIntolerance profile, then I see that slice become must support. Is that intended? Interestingly, if I explicitly add <code>\"mustSupport\" : false</code> to the slice it then goes away. Is <em>that</em> intended?</p>",
