(didn't matter for a long time, while the versions were stable). <br>\n- That version has now disappeared, and the IG publisher can't read those output files. <br>\n- if you are trying to publish an IG that has a dependency on another IG (usually that is either us-core or au-base at the moment), then you cannot reference the IG as published, until they are regenerated. <br>\n- You must regenerate the IG locally, and then reference your local copy </p>\n<p>If you are working with some dependency that can not be regenerated in this fashion, we need to talk...</p>",
