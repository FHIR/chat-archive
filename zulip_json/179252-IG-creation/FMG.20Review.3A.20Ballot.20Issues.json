From the email Melva sent: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dependency error - You need to lock to a specific version of vr-common-library - ideally the most recent ballot snapshot.  If they need newer content than that, they'll have to make an arrangement with Grahame to have a snapshot taken of vr-common-library that they can point to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>FYI: Vital Records Common Library is error free, it just has one warning left which is to do with the Jira spec (and I may or may not get to fixing that this week, otherwise I'll ask <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"197608\">@David deRoode</span> to fix it early next week, as he actually knows what he is doing in that space!).</p>",
