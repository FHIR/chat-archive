        "content": "<p>I took a quick scan and I have no idea what you're doing.  You've got a whole mix of HTML and Markdown - and a huge number of files.  In general, it's best to build an implementation guide up.  Start with just a few files and make sure that builds well, then build up to something more complex.  I've never actually used markdown with the IGPublisher, so I'm not well positioned to diagnose.   As Grahame has mentioned, this forum isn't really intended for this level of support.  If you're getting an error message that's incoherent or the build is throwing a null pointer error, then that's absolutely our responsibility to fix.  But if the particular organization of your files happens to be wrong, that's on you to fix - or to hire someone to assist you.  If you're not in a position to hire someone, start with one of the existing implementation guides , trim it down to the bare minimum and get that to run, then replace with your own bare minimum content and get that to run, then slowly increase the content and complexity, building regularly.  That will make it much easier to figure out what's going on.</p>",
