This is a pain to constantly debug only made worse by the fact that GitHub which does not change the case for a file name (which I keep forgetting) when you change it locally.  So can we just make everything case insensitive in the publisher to stop wasting all this time?</p>\n<p>for example  I'm going to make a couple of template tweaks to make the file naming for type in pages <em>-intro and -notes</em> case insensitive so ValueSet.md and valueset.md and valueSet*.md are treated the same. Does anybody have any issues with that?</p>\n<p>here is an example of what I mean:</p>\n<p>here is a pagecontent directory:</p>\n<p>├── OperationDefinition-example-notes.md<br>\n├── StructureDefinition-extension-blah-intro.md<br>\n├── StructureDefinition-extension-complex-intro.md<br>\n├──etc</p>\n<p>which Would be equivalent to:</p>\n<p>├── operationdefinition-example-notes.md<br>\n├── structureDefinition-extension-blah-intro.md<br>\n├── STRUCTUREDEFINITION-extension-complex-intro.md<br>\n├──etc</p>\n<p>Right now the second won't be rendered...</p>",
