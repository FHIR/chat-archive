        "content": "<p>I am just releasing a new IG publisher. This IG publisher includes a breaking change, and it may impact on you. </p>\n<p>The change is that by default, when you nominate a template in ig.ini,  if you <em>don't</em> nominate a version, like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"INI\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">[IG]</span>\n<span class=\"na\">ig</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">input/hl7-fhir-us-ecr.xml</span>\n<span class=\"na\">template</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">hl7.fhir.template</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Then the IG publisher will default to the most recent published version, not the current ci-build version. It's been doing that - using the ci-build version - but that is not what is documented to happen, and it doesn't make sense. So from now on, it will default to the most recent published version. If you want to opt in to the ci-build version of the template, do this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"INI\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">[IG]</span>\n<span class=\"na\">ig</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">input/hl7-fhir-us-ecr.xml</span>\n<span class=\"na\">template</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">hl7.fhir.template#current</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>In practice, the most recent published version of the template is the same as the ci-build for the common templates, and you won't notice the change from ci-build to last release.</p>\n<p>But you will notice this if the template has never been formally released. If it hasn't, and you don't explicitly nominate the current version, the build will fail since there is no released version. You can resolve this one of two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nominate the current version as shown above. </li>\n<li>ask me to release the template into the packaging system</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(or both!)</p>",
