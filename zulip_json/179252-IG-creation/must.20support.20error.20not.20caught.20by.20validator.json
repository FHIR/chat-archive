They were created using the spreadsheet and for several elements the must support cells were blank which apparently led to must-support = false.   However the vitals profile defined these elements as must-support = true.  The issue is that the validator did not catch this (nor did I until looking at the SD directly).  Where should I log a tracker re the validator .  Jira or a Github issue?</p>",
