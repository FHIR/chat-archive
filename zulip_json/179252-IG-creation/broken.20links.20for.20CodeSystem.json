I haven't explored it yet to be sure, but I'm guessing that you updated your templates along the way after we started and we didn't pick up those changes.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191415\">@Giorgio Cangioli</span> added this code and figured out that it worked - and I assume he got his inspiration from the code for ValueSet, which is quite similar (except for '-content' vs. '-cld'), but he will have to say.  But maybe we need to do a more general update of the framework at this point?  And if so, can you point us to the best (or at least a correct) place to get those updates?</p>",
