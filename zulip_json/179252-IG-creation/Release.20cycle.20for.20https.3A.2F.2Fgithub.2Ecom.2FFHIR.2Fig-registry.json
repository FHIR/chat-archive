Getting a new feed approved to get in that file might take a day or two, as Grahame mentions, but afterwards you can publish any new package, and versions thereof, in that feed. Registered feeds are read by Simplifier and thus <a href=\"http://registry.fhir.org\">registry.fhir.org</a>, multiple times per day.<br>\nSo, first time adding a feed: few days, every new package (version) in there: few hours.</p>\n<p>On top of that you might want to get your IG (version) published to the manually curated list of the <strong>FHIR Implementation Guide Registry</strong> (<a href=\"http://fhir.org/guides/registry/\">http://fhir.org/guides/registry/</a>). That involves a PR to <a href=\"https://github.com/FHIR/ig-registry/blob/master/fhir-ig-list.json\">https://github.com/FHIR/ig-registry/blob/master/fhir-ig-list.json</a> on every publication, so expected ETA of a few days again.
