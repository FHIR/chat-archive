        "content": "<p>I pulled this out of Valueset Rendering and made it a separate topic.  We have some GPS value sets now in IPS that combine contents from two different SNOMED CT releases.  In these cases the vast majority of the content is from the July 2019 release, but there are also a few of the new coronavirus concepts included from the March 9 2020 release.  So the value set definition contains two compose.include.version element instances.  But the rendering of that in the expansion right now is ignoring the first instance (for July 2019) and states only that \"Expansion based on SNOMED CT International edition 09-Mar 2020\".  I think what it needs to do instead is list both of them as separate lines (within the same box), so it would be:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>Expansion based on SNOMED CT International edition 31-Jul 2019\nExpansion based on SNOMED CT International edition 09-Mar 2020\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I don't think that it will matter if you can tell in the expansion results which of the concepts came from which system and version (you can figure that out separately if you need to), but I think that it does matter that all of them are included in the display rendering.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I'm bringing this back up again.  The previous fix is working well for our original use case in IPS for our value sets where the expansion is based on codes that are being included from more than one version of a code system.

In this case the codes are all coming from the same two versions of SNOMED CT as in the previous example.  So theoretically I believe that the two displays of the \"expansion source\" should be exactly the same, but in this case the displayed text is all convoluted - and I think it's incomprehensible and parts of it appear likely to be incorrect (if you can actually understand how to parse it to be able to determine that).  Even with the contributions from the three value sets, I don't see a reason why there should be this level of redundancy and multiple odd combinations and confusing orders.  Hopefully it's something that can be fixed without too much difficulty. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span>?</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/mnhLgvtdth0sFvtcFBcE4r4M/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-22.26.01.png\" title=\"example\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/mnhLgvtdth0sFvtcFBcE4r4M/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-22.26.01.png\"></a></div>",
