The terminology service doesn't currently support the urls or urns for expansions, etc., and PHIN VADS doesn't provide a FHIR API.  So I don't think there's a great answer, but it would be good to work out a more robust general strategy for it as working with PHIN VADS will be common in some contexts.</p>",
