Resolution = \"The Contributor data type is being removed on the grounds that it's not being used in any resources and is not terribly consistent with FHIR design principles - FHIR prefers that participations be explicit to allow distinct control over constraints.  We're not comfortable retaining the data type solely for this new proposed use-case.  As well, we're concerned about throwing a large amount of history data on a single data element.  In general, the history of what's happened to a resource is managed using the built-in 'history' capability as well as Provenance and AuditEvent.  If you care who changed a security tag (and why), that's the mechanism that should be used.\"  </p>\n<p>Resolution is that I need to create a new CR to justify a change request for a disposition decision for which, as far as I recall, I was not notified about occurring.  Think the decision needs to be reopened for in person discussion rather than submit a similar CR.</p>\n<p>RE Resolution's suggestion to use AuditEvent - AuditEvents are not typically exchanged and have many unnecessary elements for this use case.  </p>\n<p>RE Resolution's suggestion to use Provenance, adding the need to retrieve Provenance for every security label element, which may change depending on consent directives or exchange of Resource across policy domains has a lot of unnecessary overhead including a trust agreement to generate and make available Provenance Resource for every created/changed security label.  Not only is the target (or sub-resource target) needing to be repeated in the Provenance Resource, but the agent, the action, the security labels in the predecessor and in the successor etc.  </p>\n<p>All that's needed for the Security Label Classifier is the timestamp, name, contact, and role of the classifier.  If someone wants a complete accounting, then they may want to retrieve a Provenance Record, e.g., if they want to see which labels changed.  But that's more than what's needed to establish the accountability for the label.  Reason that matters?  As a receiver, I may care about who labeled the Resource in order to know whether I need to enforce/persist it (e.g., because of a Trust Agreement) or whether I can change it per my policy domain.  </p>\n<p>Provenance info - Why they changed it (their policy), how they changed it (upgraded/downgraded/declassified etc., where the action repeats the classifier functional role type so not informative), from what to what etc. is irrelevant.</p>",
