The FishExample defines two dependencies in the package.json file, as such:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {\n      &quot;hl7.fhir.r4.core&quot;: &quot;4.0.1&quot;,\n    &quot;hl7.fhir.us.core&quot;: &quot;3.1.0&quot;\n  }\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>When I run _genonce to run the IG Publisher, I get the following error after it successfully loads several packages:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Dependency &#39;hl7.fhir.us.core&#39; has no id, so can&#39;t be referred to in markdown in the IG\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>After a bunch of tinkering, I am submitting this post :)  Has anyone experienced this problem?  I would assume there are many IGs with these two principal dependencies, so maybe I am just misconfigured.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your help!</p>",

        "content": "<p>yes, it's not an error, but just a warning.  Basically, SUSHI isn't specifying an ID for the US core dependency, so it can't be referenced in markdown.  Unless you want to reference it in markdown, this isn't a problem.  It was raised on the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"215610\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/215610-shorthand\">#shorthand</a> channel and the devs know about it.</p>",
