The argument comes down to the phrase in the core spec: \"modifies the meaning of the element that contains it\".  <br>\nI have an End Reason extension to provide a reason why an Address, Name, ContactPoint, etc. were ended.  The reviewer asserts that it negates the meaning of the thing it is attached to.  I don't think it does negate or modify, it's just providing additional information.  <br>\nWhile that might be clear, I also have a Date of Death extension for a Practitioner.  I similarly make the argument that it doesn't change the meaning of the rest of the elements on Practitioner.  It might change the business actions that occur for the Practitioner, but I don't think it modifies the meaning of Practitioner or any of its elements.<br>\nIs the rule around whether something is a modifier extension as simple as \"would downstream processing of the resource be different if the extension wasn't present\"?</p>",
