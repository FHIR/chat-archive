A macro is then used to copy the appropriate columns across to the ballot spreadsheet.<br>\nthe ballot is closed using the normal procedure on the ballot desktop (upload ballot reconciliation spreadsheet etc), seek formal withdrawals, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>... is there a write-up of how to do this? How is an extract taken? How is an Excel extract generated? What macro is then used?</p>",
