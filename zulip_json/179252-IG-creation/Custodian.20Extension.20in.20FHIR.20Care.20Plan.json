Now who owns the plan? It is the same paradigm that exists in FHIR  Provenance or in CDA and C-CDA on FHIR wrt the difference between author and custodian.

Also - If you look at the eLTSS guide they essentially changed the definition of author in Care Plan in their IG - though they did not add a custodian :-)</p>",
