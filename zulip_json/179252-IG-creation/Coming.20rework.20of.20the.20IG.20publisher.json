Not sure how significant a savings that is though in the grand scheme of things.  The other is to ensure that there's control over what appears in the IG.  With fragments, if they'r enot referenced, they won't show up.  But I don't think that same control exists for examples.  If I don't want JSON or XML in my IG publication, then the publication process needs to ensure those don't show up - not in the zips, not on the website, etc.</p>",
