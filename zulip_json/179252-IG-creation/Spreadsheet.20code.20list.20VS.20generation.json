Within the resources? Ah, I see you can set the version like so:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>&quot;ValueSet/artifact-comment-type&quot;: {\n      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;,\n      &quot;base&quot;: &quot;ValueSet-artifact-comment-type.html&quot;\n    }\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>That didn't resolve the issue though (for version)... So I am probably doing it wrong? I don't see a way to define the publisher.</p>",
