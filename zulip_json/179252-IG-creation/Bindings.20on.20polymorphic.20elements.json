Can we get it to only yell about bindings declared in the differential, not the snapshot?</li>\n<li>It complains even when only one of the types in the choice is subject to being bound.  It'd be nice if it didn't do that - though we probably need to add some language that clarifies what elements are subject to bindings and what aren't.  (And we should automatically strip bindings from elements that have been constrained to only include types that can't be bound.)</li>\n</ul>",
