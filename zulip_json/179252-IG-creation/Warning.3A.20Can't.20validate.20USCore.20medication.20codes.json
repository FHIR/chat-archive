Both 2284960 and 2395502 are valid codes for the \"remdesivir 100 MG Injection\" product corresponding to the 61958290101 NDC code, just for either the \"Clinical Drug or Pack\" or the \"Branded Drug or Pack\".  I don't see that using either one of them would be \"wrong\" (unless only the \"branded\" product codes are acceptable for some reason).  The bottom line is that RxNorm needs to be updated on the <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a> server.</p>",
