I throw a copy of the package-list in the the _data directory (as YAML of course) and publish the section as a  note to balloters so they can review too.  It is created from a jira export and a bit of regex and then  i manually enter the links for the changes and summary of changes the add a little markdown summary to give an overview.   It makes applying changes more tedious and time consuming and thus costs more.  Could add  field for links to target changs and short summary of change to jira and then generate the change log for publishing  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  this is something we should consider adding to the list of IG editing topic?</p>",
