Long time reader, first time writer.</p>\n<p>I have a case where I need to output an IG in different languages, so I've started looking at implementing the functionality described under <a href=\"https://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=IG_Publisher_Documentation#Language_Support\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=IG_Publisher_Documentation#Language_Support\">https://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=IG_Publisher_Documentation#Language_Support</a> in the IG publisher tool.<br>\nSo far I've only done a quick poc for utilizing translation extensions, and before going onward I'm curious about a couple of things.</p>\n<p>I see that a lot of the pieces of the puzzle are there just waiting to be put to use. Has progress been made here that has not been pushed to the github repository?<br>\nIs there an idea of how the format for languages.json should look? Both in structure, and how placeholders for inserted values will look?<br>\nWhile I don't oppose using a json file for language strings/translations, I'm curious if there is a firm reason for doing so, as compared to using Java resource bundles.</p>",
