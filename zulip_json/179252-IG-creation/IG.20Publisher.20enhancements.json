I don't know whether you'll find this useful, but you can now pass two new kind of URLs to the IG publisher via the -ig parameter:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>-ig https://github.com/IHE/ITI.PIXm\n-ig https://github.com/IHE/ITI.PIXm/tree/master\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>You can pass a github URL. Or you can pass a link to <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org\">build.fhir.org</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code> -ig http://build.fhir.org/ig/dvci/vaccine-credential-ig/branches/main\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The IG publisher will grab a copy of the current github repo for the branch, and then build it locally. This is <em>not</em> a useful thing to do if you're developing the content of the IG - any local changes you make will be blown away when you next build it. But if you're debugging, like I do, it's convenient.</p>",
