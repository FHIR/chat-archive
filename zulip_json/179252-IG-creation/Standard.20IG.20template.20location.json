The template links on the wiki are wrong and I couldn't find anything in GitHub.  The two previous IGuides I worked on have quite a bit of customization so I thought it would be easier to start from scratch with a template rather than trying to pare those down.  Does anyone have a link for a starting IG template?</p>",
