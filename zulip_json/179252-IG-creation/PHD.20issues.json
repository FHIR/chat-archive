This is what I have in my code system:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>  &lt;concept&gt;\n    &lt;code value=&quot;SYSID&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;display value=&quot;IEEE 11073 System Identifier&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;definition value=&quot;This code indicates that the identifier is the IEEE 11073 SystemId from the equivalent of the System-Id attribute&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;/concept&gt;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Is that insufficient?</p>\n<p>The examples were taken from an actual implementation which uploads measurement sequences in Bundles. Resources uploaded previously are not uploaded again (Patient, Device). Uploaded resources are also different than resources that exist on the server if they are created as there is no logical id or there is a temporary id. But in the end I was thinking like my PHMR CDA examples, where one shows an example of that template one is discussing. It just seemed overkill to have the same type of Device and Coincident time stamp examples that show nothing different. In some cases I had to 'fake' them as I have no device producing a time fault so I created a time fault Coincident time stamp example that nothing references. But the implementer can see how it is encoded.</p>\n<p>Actually I re-made these examples as md-pages and link the reader to them in the text. In those I can put comments and remarks (no standard way to comment a JSON representation) and this is what the reader is directed to for implementation purposes as they will be different than those that sit on a server.</p>\n<p>I added the extra examples. Increased the number of errors though. However, the <em>types</em> of errors are now down to 2 instead of 3.</p>",
