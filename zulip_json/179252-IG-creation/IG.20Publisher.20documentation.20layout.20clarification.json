[Type]-[id].canonical.[fmt] - the resource for the specified format in canonical format (not produced for ttl) (not currently produced)</li>\n<li>redirects from /[Type]/[id] to one of the pages above (depending on request format)</li>\n<li>[Type]-[id].[fmt].html - An HTML wrapper around the specified format, with a link to the native form</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have a question from our devops guys. <br>\nIs there a way to configure the publisher to create the subdirectories so that redirection isn't necessary? <br>\ne.g., we see that <code>note: you can rename this page using the control file</code>. <br>\nIs it permissible to rename <code>[Type]-[id].html</code> to <code>[Type]/[id].html</code>? <br>\nOr to define subdirectories where the different types are found? I think I know the answer to this, but just want to confirm.</p>\n<p>Also, re redirection, should the redirection point to the current release at the top level, or point to the most recent milestone release explicitly. For example, let's say we have an IG whose most recent milestone is STU1, and can be found at <br>\n<code>myig/</code><br>\nand at<br>\n<code>myig/STU1</code></p>\n<p>should <br>\n<code>myig/StructureDefinition/thing</code><br>\nredirect to<br>\n<code>myig/StructureDefinition-thing.html</code> ?<br>\nor should it redirect to<br>\n<code>myig/STU1/StructureDefinition-thing.html</code> ?</p>",
