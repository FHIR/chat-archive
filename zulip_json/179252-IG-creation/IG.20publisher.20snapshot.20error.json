There is a typo in the spec on the Device.property.valueQuanity. I was spelling it correctly Device.property.valueQuantity. Note the missing 't'. I ran into the same problem in HAPI FHIR which took me hours to solve! I have already submitted a change request for it during the HL7 meeting last week.</p>",
