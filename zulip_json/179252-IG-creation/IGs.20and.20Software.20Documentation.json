(e.g. this data that was just given to you must be preserved as it will be asked for later on a different interface)... <br>\nThe main reason to keep these out of an IG is to assure that the IG is as portable as possible. That is, the IG is not fixed to a specific type of technology, or technical architecture. An IG should be re-usable in various settings.<br>\nBUT,  sometimes the audience for an IG is very specific. Such as an IG being written to both define an interface and a persistence systems design. Sometimes it is just most efficient to write it together. Just recognize that when this is done, it will limit the re-usability.</p>",
