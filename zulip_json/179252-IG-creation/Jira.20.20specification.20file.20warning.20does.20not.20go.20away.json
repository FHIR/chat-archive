With the default FHIR-pocd.xml in JIRA-Spec-Artifacts (having only deprecated artifact entries for base resources) the publisher created entries that are now in jira-current.xml. I changed the name by appending \"(CodeSystem)\" or \"(ValueSet)\" for the four pairs with equal names. After the update on JIRA-Spec-Artifacts the IG publisher seems to mix up CodeSystem and ValueSet entries in jira-new.xml.<br>\nThe build log has warnings \"Jira file generation will not be correct because multiple artifacts have the same name (ignoring content in '()')\". What does that mean? In the IG, identical names for CodeSystem and ValueSet are not an issue because they are clearly separated. In Jira they need to be distinguished, therefore I changed the names.</p>",
