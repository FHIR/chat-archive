Without a clear delineation of where one grouping starts and another ends, it's less clear how the content is organized.  For example, take a look at the <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/toc.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/toc.html\">SDC TOC</a>, trying to wear your first-time-viewer (not SDC expert) glasses.  It's pretty confusing, right?  Wouldn't it be a lot easier to understand and navigate if you saw the groupings like on the <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/artifacts.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/artifacts.html\">SDC Artifacts</a> page?</p>",
