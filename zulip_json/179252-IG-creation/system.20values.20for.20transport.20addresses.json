This isn't something that's FHIR-specific - these are cross-family issues.  Proposals for addition and revision require public review and comment.  There's a need to tie into our processes for engagement with external organizations.  FHIR registry doesn't meet any of those requirements.  I understand the resource challenges, but those challenges exist regardless of where we put the work.  The work <em>belongs</em> with THO - where there are people who understand what a 'namespace' actually is, who can evaluate whether a request coming in is appropriate as a code system vs. an identifier system, who understand the backward compatibility and cross-standard impact of updates, etc.</p>",

If it is wrong, everything gets messed up in the build. The permissions issue should only be Jira-related, so once we get a Jira admin to make sure you are a submitter (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196484\">@Joshua Procious</span>  or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191982\">@Ted Klein</span> ) then you should be good to go.
