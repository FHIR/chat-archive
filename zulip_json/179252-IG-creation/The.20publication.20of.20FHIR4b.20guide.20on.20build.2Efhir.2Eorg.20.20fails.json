Assuming you're not trying to do anything that requires R4B, then what you're encountering seems to be a separate issue.  And it looks like it is in the IG Publisher code after SUSHI completes, so likely not SUSHI-related.  If it's the <code>org.hl7.fhir.r5.renderers</code> that is throwing you off, I think that is a red herring.  I believe <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> uses some code in the r5 Java namespace even to render R4 IGs.</p>",
