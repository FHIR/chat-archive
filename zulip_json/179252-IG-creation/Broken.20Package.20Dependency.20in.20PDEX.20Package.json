Looking at the hl7.fhir.core package summary, that version doesn't exist: <a href=\"http://packages.fhir.org/hl7.fhir.core\">http://packages.fhir.org/hl7.fhir.core</a></p>\n<p>I guess one obvious problem is that PDEX should depend on <code>4.0.x</code> and not on a specific point version. More broadly though. what does other tooling do about this kind of situation? If I'm reading the IG correctly, it's about a year old so surely other tooling has already tripped over this and come up with an appropriate algorithm to deal with it? Should HAPI just assume 4.0.x if 4.0.0 can't be found?</p>",
