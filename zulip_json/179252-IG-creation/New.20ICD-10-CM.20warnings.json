If you would like to have  those codes supported you can let me know that they are and we can arrange to do that.  That definitely may occur for ICD-10-CM and NDC, as the available codes for them in the terminology server are quite limited.  Possibly the CVX version is outdated and needs to be updated.</p>",

But you can't do that in reverse, as there is no algorithmic way to determine which of the three patterns of the dashes to apply, and they result in different (actual or potential) codes.  Your second option of having two codes and declaring that they are equivalent is what I believe we will need to do in FHIR - unless, instead for convenience we decide to actually represent them as two separate code systems.  We're still having some discussions in HTA (who said previously it should be a single code system) and Vocab WG about this.</p>",
