They almost seem to be copies of the base FHIR profiles (I haven't looked at them too closely).</p>\n<p>Looks like they were in Git for the previous version of the IG but they didn't show up on any of the pages in the published IG. They are showing up now in the new version. Under headings like \"Abstract Profiles\", etc. </p>\n<p>None of the ODH templates seem to be based on them.</p>\n<p>I want to delete them all, but I'm scared I'm going to screw something up.</p>\n<p>So basically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>does anybody know what they are for?</li>\n<li>can we delete them?</li>\n</ul>",
