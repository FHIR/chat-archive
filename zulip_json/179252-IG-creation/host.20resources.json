We have a 4 core CPU and 32Gigs of memory on this server (shared). Whenever someone publishes and IG, these resources get used up pretty good and if someone sneezes, the server gets pinned down (maxed cpu/ram). We have been throwing more RAM and CPU at this VM for months now. Does anyone have any recommendations on RAM and CPU for this java task? or even how to manage this with Java options or ....?</p>",
