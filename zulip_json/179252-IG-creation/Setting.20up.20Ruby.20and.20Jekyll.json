I have Ruby 2.5.7p206 installed and did gem install jekyll with Jekyll 4.1.1.  I pulled a couple of IG's and using the updatePublisher and genonce batch files ran them both to the end / build finished.  However, I do not have any html files in output folder (there are html files in qa and temp).  Can anyone tell me what I need to do or look for?  (Keep in mind that I am not a developer so use simple language please :) )</p>\n<p>One other note, I tried a simple jekyll command to start a blog.  Jekyll seems to run but nothing happens.  Same when I do jekyll -v.  No error just a return to command line.</p>\n<p>ThanQ in advance for your help</p>",
