On the generated page for the value set there is a statement that says \"This value set is not used here; it may be used elsewhere (e.g. specifications and/or implementations that use this content)\"  This only happens for the value sets bound to the extensions and not ones for backbone elements.  I have double checked and all of the value sets are indeed used.  <br>\nWhy is this statement being generated?  <br>\nHere's an example: <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cimi-vital-signs/branches/master/ValueSet-AssociatedSituationVS.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cimi-vital-signs/branches/master/ValueSet-AssociatedSituationVS.html</a></p>",
