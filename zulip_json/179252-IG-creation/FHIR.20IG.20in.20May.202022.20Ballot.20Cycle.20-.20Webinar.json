A webinar will be held on February 24th from 1pm to 2:30pm Eastern to review the upcoming key dates, requirements for FHIR IGs going to ballot and additional information on the CI build and Jira Spec File requirements.  It is required that all FHIR IG Developers attend this session as part of this ballot cycle.  If you are not able to attend, please let me know.  We will be recording this session and I can provide that recording to you.  If you do not attend the webinar or request the recording, your IG may not be approved for the May 2022 Ballot Cycle.</p>\n<p>You must register in advance for this meeting:<br>\n<a href=\"https://hl7-org.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIkdOqoqDMsGdIxRJ75ja7O2ujBWX_ncKFS\">https://hl7-org.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIkdOqoqDMsGdIxRJ75ja7O2ujBWX_ncKFS</a> </p>\n<p>NOTE:  This webinar is specific to FHIR Management Group (FMG) requirements for getting a FHIR IG approved for the upcoming ballot cycle and is NOT intended for individuals who are trying to learn how to develop a FHIR IG.</p>\n<p>Work Group Co-chairs â€“ please make sure that the developers for FHIR IGs for your Work Group are aware of this requirement.</p>",
