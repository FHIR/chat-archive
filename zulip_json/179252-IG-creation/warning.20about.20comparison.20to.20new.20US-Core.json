I'm assuming this warning will be allowed to be bypassed without needing a waiver by FMG.  I get that the comparison is done even if you don't declare a dependency on US Core, but I think that it should only use the latest officially published version, i.e. 4.0.0 and not the latest version of any type, i.e. 4.1.0.</p>",
