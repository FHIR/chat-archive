        "content": "<p>ok, I've added search to all the IGs on the web site. The UV ones are still uploading, but the US ones are all up. Every version of every IG has a search now. the search works using DuckDuckGo - google both is really manual to set up and also insists on advertising (in theory we can ask them not to but in practice it's not reliable that they'll agree. But DuckDuckGo is just simple and direct. (And it works in all countries)</p>\n<p>The challenge for that for me is that I wanted to retrospectively add a search link to every page in the IGs. That's ~150k html files, so it clearly wasn't something I'd do be hand. But all the guides have slightly different HTML structures... so it wasn't a case of simple search and replace. I did what I could and checked quite a lot of pages, and it all looks good to me. </p>\n<p>What I'm asking for is for you to check your IGs, particularly the milestone publications, that there is a search link on the page, either top (using the search icon) or bottom (just the word 'search'). Let me know if you find pages with no search link. </p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",
