Worst case, the dependent IG may be broken by the USCore changes.  </p>\n<p>At what point would a  dependent IG need to go to ballot or is it possible to release an updated IG vX.0.1 without a comment period if it's a non-breaking change?  How much of the publication process is needed when the dependent IG hasn't changed but USCore has?</p>",
