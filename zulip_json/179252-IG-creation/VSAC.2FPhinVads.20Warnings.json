It's like we have tools that are getting better and better for the source of truth for value sets, and then we statically list out the codes in the IG. It's almost as bad as listing them inside a CDA IG Word document....\"</em> PLUS the authoring issues ... Its just crazy that this is an issue still. Sounds like policy people banging heads together refusing to move in to the 21st century and its VERY frustrating. I've got 100's of value sets I built in VSAC for the Multiple Chronic Conditions IG - which will be hugely problematic for those that have taken over the project (though I think think IG still sits only in Trifolia and so I can still access the value sets via the IG. Though I do have to go through 7 clicks to get to a value set the first time I open the IG for a session). That project is NIH funded. US Core is ONC funded ... and yet neither project can efficiently access an NLM funded project/tool that is VSAC. Is this not IN YOUR FACE ridiculous???</p>",

In vsac the html view links you are using (the ones that have the https://<strong>vsac</strong>.nlm.nih.gov/ base) can have two different types of endpoints. The ones that end in /expansion are going to the latest expansion (latest definition version applied against the latest code system version) and are viewable by any logged in user. The ones with /definition are only visible to vsac users that are also authors because that endpoint is displaying the latest value set definition, not the expansion. Given that the FHIR API only works for enumerated definitions, it can look the same, but it's not. I assume <strong>you never want to link to the definition</strong> because what you are interested in displaying for the user to look at is the expansion. </p>\n<p>Gay, your list of issues are actually pretty complex requirements. I'd be interested (seriously) if any terminology server supports a friendly UI that meets all those requirements because I suspect each requirement needs a different thing (html view, true FHIR resource endpoint, free and unencumbered access to any terminology independent of IP requirements, etc.)</p>",
