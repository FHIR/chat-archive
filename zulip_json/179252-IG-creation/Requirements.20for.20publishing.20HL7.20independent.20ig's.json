The FHIR datatype Timing has a required binding which refers to the ValueSet  <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/event-timing\">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/event-timing</a>. This includes all the codes from as defined in <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-TimingEvent\">http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-TimingEvent</a>. </p>\n<p>My question was, what kind of license would be necessary for <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-TimingEvent\">http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-TimingEvent</a>. But I have seen now, that this redirects to <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/TimingEvent/cs.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/TimingEvent/cs.html</a> and is covered in that case by the general FHIR license, nice!</p>",
