It's kind of a bit hard to version the IG publisher because there's no big ambition for structural changes to it, just a never-ending stream of small features and bug fixes. So I'm really not sure when it would be appropriate to increment minor or major versions. </p>\n<p>And there's no reason for binary compatibility for the publisher API to be an issue either, so <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191319\">@James Agnew</span> has pointed out that semver isn't necessarily appropriate. Given that, I'm wondering whether we should version the IG publisher the way smileCDR is versioned:</p>\n<p>YYYY.MM.N</p>\n<p>Where n serially increments and resets to 0 when the YYYY.MM changes</p>",
