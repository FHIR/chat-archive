Although I find it both combersome and confusing to have 2 parallel versioning systems, at least we should be able access both if we need to within the publishing framework.    It could  be an HL7 extension <code>http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/dumb-hl7-version</code>  on the IG resource to access it programatically.</p>",
