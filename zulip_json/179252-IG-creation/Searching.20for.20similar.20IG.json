When one is writing a new IG, it is very helpful to find all previous profiles on the resource they are looking to profile, so that they can re-use rather than re-invent that profile. Say for example I am looking to profile \"Patient\" resource, I should be able to find all others that have profiled Patient, and from that find the Implementation Guides that did the profile (or are using the profile).</p>",
