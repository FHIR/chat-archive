I got similar errors when rebuilding the PoCD IG a few weeks ago (which haven't been reported in the September ballot version). The errors are about links from the profile's differential view to detailed descriptions for slices on data type choices. I got them fixed by replacing the specific type (e.g., valueQuantity) by generic type (e.g., value[x]) in the element.path expression.</p>",

I have similar value[x] slices all over the place and they do not create the errors. However, when I do as you say on JUST the accuracy component in the Numeric, those errors do, indeed, go away. There are two more components that have such errors. The accuracy in the compound and the threshold and alert-op  text strings in the Numeric.</p>\n<p>Why not all the other sliced value[x]s where I DON'T have a value[x] in the path?<br>\nThis</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>    &lt;element id=&quot;Observation.value[x]:valueQuantity.system&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;path value=&quot;Observation.valueQuantity.system&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;min value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;fixedUri value=&quot;http://unitsofmeasure.org&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/element&gt;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>causes no error.</p>",
