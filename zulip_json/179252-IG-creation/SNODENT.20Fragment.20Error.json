Basically the issue is that the SNODENT code system is labelled as a fragment. However, this is causing the IG publisher to throw errors such as \"Error from server: The filter \"concept descendent-of 165877D\" was not understood in the context of <a href=\"http://www.ada.org/snodent\">http://www.ada.org/snodent</a>\".</p>\n<p>It was determined on FMG that the above error should be a warning rather than an error.</p>\n<p>(For background see this thread: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/Snodent.20code.20errors-.20code.20system.20is.20labelled.20as.20a.20fragment\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/Snodent.20code.20errors-.20code.20system.20is.20labelled.20as.20a.20fragment</a>)</p>",
