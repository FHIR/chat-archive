I haven't found a way to do it (using <code>&lt;fhirVersion value=\"current\"/&gt;</code> doesn't work) - but I think it would be a useful capability to have.  The Order Catalog IG could use this for accessing the renamed ClinicalUseDefinition resource and the latest updates to MedicationKnowledge that are currently only available in the CI build.</p>",
