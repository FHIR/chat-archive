This will be simpler and less prone to error. In addition, I'll be asking a few more questions about the proposed publication in the json template. </p>\n<p>We're finding that it's really hard for editors to nail down the details of the publication request. There's checklists etc, but there's still lots of problems in what is being submitted. This change is part of trying to clean up the pipeline so that it's simpler over all for editors</p>",
