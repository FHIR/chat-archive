When we generate differentials for elements on which only the mapping changed, it ends up getting rendered in the differential tab in the IG -- but since the differential tab doesn't show the mappings, it is confusing since there is no visible difference.  In fact, it detracts from the user's ability to see and understand the structural differences in the profile.</p>",
