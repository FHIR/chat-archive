In the publisher, I have xhtml files which make up the 'home', 'overview', profiles, etc. links across the top of rendered page. When I click on the 'profiles' page, I display the table of structure definitions. What I would like to have after that is a table of links (like a table of contents) which when clicked on brings one to one of my many markdown pages describing how each of these profiles and how they are mapped from 20601. How would I do this? I know how to link markdown pages but I am not sure how I should place them in folders etc. Don't know if that would work anyways in the context of the publisher..</p>\n<p>I tried the following:<br>\nI put in the header of a markdown file this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>## Phd Base Observation Profile &lt;a name=&quot;PhdBase&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>and in a markdown page 'included' by using the ugly </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>&lt;div&gt;\n                &lt;p&gt;\n                {% capture p1 %}{% include profiles.md %}{% endcapture %}\n                {{ p1 | markdownify }}\n                &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I put the following link:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span># Table of Contents\n[Phd Base Observation Profile](#PhdBase)\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Upon rendering it generated a nice looking link that was clickable but went nowhere. I placed both markdown pages in the '_includes'  directory. That's probably the problem.  I do not know where to place this linked page or tell the IG publisher where to find it.</p>\n<p>tried this as well in the included markdown page</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>{% link _include _includes/BaseObservationProfile.md %}  or {% link _includes/BaseObservationProfile.md %}\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>In the first case IG Pub gave error <br>\nke sure the document exists and the path is correct.<br>\n _includes/BaseObservationProfile.md' in tag 'link'.<br>\n(which is correct)</p>\n<p>In the second case IG pub gave error<br>\nke sure the document exists and the path is correct.<br>\n s/BaseObservationProfile.md' in tag 'link'.</p>",

The PoCD guide has a set of xhtml files in its pages directory, each of which uses the FHIR HL7 headers, navigation bar, and footers. The files correspond to the home, profiles, etc. 'links' posted in the nav bar.  I can use an ugly command in these xhtml files to include a markdown file by putting the file in the pages/_includes directory. </p>\n<p>But once in the page, the only way I can make links to my other pages is to use the markdown [ link name ] (<em>link</em>) and <strong>include</strong> that page in the current page.
