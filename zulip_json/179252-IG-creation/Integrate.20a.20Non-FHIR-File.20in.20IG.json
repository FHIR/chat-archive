As an example, in the CDISC Mapping IG, I've got an XML file that is a semi-computable representation of the mappings.  We didn't use StructureMap because that was too heavy for what we were trying to accomplish.  So it's just custom XML.  We did want to provide it to consumers of the IG in case they wanted to come up with their own renderings/transformations of it.  I just stuck it in the 'images' folder and it migrates fine.</p>",
