The local build with the exact same content consistently reports \"0 broken links\".  And the build log for the auto build also shows \"0 broken links\" and displays no broken links on the CI build qa page.  So this report that's showing up now of \"qa: broken links = 1\" in Zulip appears to be completely spurious (unless there's something else being \"hidden\" somewhere).</p>",
