I have learned that though extensions in FHIR are welcomed - I see the statement,<br>\n \"To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is strict governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Although any implementer can define and use extensions, there is a set of requirements that must be met as part of their use and definition.\"</p>\n<p>But, I am not seeing what exactly these \"governance rules\" and \"requirements\" are.</p>\n<p>Are the rules here? <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility.html</a></p>\n<p>What is involved in complying with the \"governance\"?</p>",
