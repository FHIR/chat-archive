For example:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>&lt;period&gt;\n      &lt;start&gt;\n         &lt;extension url=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/cqif-cqlExpression&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;valueString value=&quot;Today()&quot;/&gt;\n         &lt;/extension&gt;\n      &lt;/start&gt;\n      &lt;end&gt;\n         &lt;extension url=&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/cqif-cqlExpression&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;valueString value=&quot;Today()&quot;/&gt;\n         &lt;/extension&gt;\n      &lt;/end&gt;\n   &lt;/period&gt;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I have an operation in my FHIR server that returns the resource(s) populated with the evaluated extension value. I did this so my test data wouldn't become deprecated the next day.<br>\nThe issue is that this is causing several errors, which don't stop the build, like the following:<br>\n<code>If present, start SHALL have a lower value than endnull [start.empty() or end.empty() or (start &lt;= end)]</code><br>\nAm I doing this incorrectly? Should my extension be an expression that returns a FHIR.Period instead, without specifying \"start\" and \"end\"?</p>",
