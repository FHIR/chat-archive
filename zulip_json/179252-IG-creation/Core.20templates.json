We recognize that the artifacts list is not exactly ideal once you start getting to bigger lists.  There's a plan to move to something more sophisticated, possibly spanning multiple pages and driven by Composition, but we haven't got to the detailed design stage yet.  You can certainly write your own template extension that overrides the existing transform to spit out something better in the interim - and/or propose suggestions for how you'd like the current process improved.</p>",
