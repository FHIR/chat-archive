I've worked with some IGs that have a very different CSS framework that are beautiful and elegant (and cost a fair bit of money to design).

Our intention is to have a standard set of templates used for all HL7 International-published IGs so that they have a consistent look-and-feel and also integrate nicely with the core specification.  That said, there's almost certainly room to improve the rendering of the core specification itself.

If you're looking at producing an IG for other purposes, you might still find it expedient to start with one of ours and then expirement and diverge as you become more familiar with how everything is stitched together.  It will certainly be possible to migrate anything you might come up with into your own \"template\" that will separate the complexity of how things are rendered from the management of the resource and page source files.</p>",
