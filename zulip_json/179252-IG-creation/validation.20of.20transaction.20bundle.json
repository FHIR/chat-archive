That is my understanding of how temp ids in a Bundle are to be. If it is supposed to be in the id element, that is a problem in HAPI FHIR that needs to be fixed. In the code I put the temp id in the id element, and HAPI FHIR removes it and puts it in the fullURL.</p>",

Can you point me to where this is documented. I see the name has been changed from temporary id to conditional id. There are not any Bundle examples that reference a resource with a conditional id that is already in the Bundle. I assume the 'urn:oid:' is still present in order to indicate that it is a conditional id.</p>",
