I just tried again there and it seems to be the same.  I've attached a zip file with a bash script that downloads the latest prebuilt validator_cli and runs the different commands on the files I was talking about, along with some inline comments on what exceptions happened for me and what I did to debug through the code to get round the parameter error.
