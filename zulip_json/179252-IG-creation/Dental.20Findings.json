(<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet-us-core-condition-category.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet-us-core-condition-category.html</a>)  </p>\n<p>Please let us know in this thread which design #1 or #2 you prefer.</p>",

Most 'generic' systems will be able to search by Condition.category and know how to store it, while you'll have to build custom support to both store and search on an extension.  Best practice is to always use core elements rather than extensions if they're fit for purpose and have the right semantics - and it seems that 'category' here fits the bill.</p>",
