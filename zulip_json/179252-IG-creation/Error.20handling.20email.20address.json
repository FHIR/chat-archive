Agree that being specific one way or the other would be best. Given that it was never a requirement, it might be hard to be specific now, so perhaps assuming that it may or may not be there at present is all you can do in general, but ... I would assume that making the IG guidelines more strict actually is an option.</p>\n<p>Since you could not do a url without scheme, I don't see why you could not be specific for email (and phone|pager|fax|sms which are all tel:). Not sure what to do with \"other\" in the IG footer.</p>\n<p>Note that this whole thing is only relevant for the first telecom as that is linked into the footer.
