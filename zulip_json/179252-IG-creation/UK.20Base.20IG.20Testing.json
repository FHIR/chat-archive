In the IG I've prefixed the name with vs- and cs- for the ValueSets and CodeSystems. It works but may not be ideal.</p>\n<p>For versioning I think we will need to up the version number in some way (I'm using software to identify to changes from <a href=\"http://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3\">fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3</a>, so incrementing version number will prevent overwrite). So a modified CareConnect-Patient-1 goes from 1.3 to 1.3.1. (Note the published resources will use the IG version - so in the IG the version number of the patient profile is 3.0.0)</p>\n<p>As <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191651\">@Rik Smithies</span> mentioned in the email, we don't need the 'CareConnect' and '-1' prefix and suffix on the profiles.

We should put forward the names that we think are the best. Then we may need to argue whether or not these are better than what exists, given that there has been some adoption. Whether or not we put \"uk\" in the name, rather than just in the path I am not sure. Let's see what is best practice. US core says \"us-core-patient\".
