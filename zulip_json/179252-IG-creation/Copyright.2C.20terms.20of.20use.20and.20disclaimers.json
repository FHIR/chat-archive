In the FHIR-I discussion, we identified that we're not at all consistent with how we populate the current 'copyright' element.  Sometimes it reflects the copyright of the artifact itself (suitable for displaying in an artifact footer - e.g. \"(c) 2019 Some company\").  In other cases, it summarizes the the copyright expectations of artifacts that are referenced.  Measure.disclaimer sometimes gets used for the same purpose.  We probably need some consistency, in particular to allow consistent rendering.</p>",
