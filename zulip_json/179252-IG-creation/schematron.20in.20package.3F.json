At least form the .sch extension I suppose it should contain such a file. But examining it, I only find a reference to the schematron file  in the ..\\temp\\pages structure. For example, in the davinci-pdex package a file is contained StructureDefinition-pdex-device.sch that contains c:\\temp\\hl7.fhir.us.davinci-pdex#1.0.0\\temp\\pages\\StructureDefinition-pdex-device.sch as its only contents (without linebreak).</p>",
