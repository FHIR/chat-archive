It mentions that the id and path should be different depending on the type. It also mentions that I should enumerate each of the types that are allowed in different elements with unique id's and path's. I've ALSO seen examples where the value uses slicing to indicate what the correct type is (with a sliceName).</p>\n<p>So, now I'm not sure <em>what</em> the correct syntax is for an extension's value. Can someone show the <em>correct</em> syntax for an extension with a value limited to a single type, as well as an extension with a value allowing multiple types (but not all types)?</p>",
