That said, I noticed that the title seems to be available at <code>site.data.pages[\"index.html\"].title</code>, so I ended up adding this code into the template wherever I need to access the title:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>{% assign title = site.data.fhir.ig.title %}\n{% unless title %}{% assign title = site.data.pages[&quot;index.html&quot;].title %}{% endunless %}\n{% unless title %}{% assign title = site.data.fhir.ig.name %}{% endunless %}\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This covers the bases so that when <code>site.data.fhir.ig.title</code> is available, it will use it; otherwise it falls back to the location I <em>discovered</em> it (but is undocumented); otherwise it just falls back to the IG name.  Seems to work.</p>",
