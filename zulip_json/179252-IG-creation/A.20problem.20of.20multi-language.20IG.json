I guess the reason is that we have translated the default description &amp; constraints from English to Chinese. So, the \"_genonce.bat\" or \"publisher.jar\" thinks we have modified the default values (even though we only do the translation without redefining cardinality, etc.) and put those translated elements in the differential table. as shown below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/e5o2dXSDZi_Jr3N_celnIraA/Image-1.jpg\">Image-1.jpg</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/e5o2dXSDZi_Jr3N_celnIraA/Image-1.jpg\" title=\"Image-1.jpg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/e5o2dXSDZi_Jr3N_celnIraA/Image-1.jpg\"></a></div><p>I wonder if there is any possibility that we could figure out the display problem by coding, not by manually deleting the unnecessary content in the output HTML files.<br>\nThank you!</p>\n<p>Li-Hui</p>",

        "content": "<p>If there is content in the differential section of your spec, it will show up in the differential rendering - even if the only change is the definitions or usage notes.   What you might consider is two layers of profiling.  The first would merely translate the set of elements you care to bother translating - but not perform any constraining.  The second would be based on the first and impose your constraints.  The differential in your second profile would thus only show the changes and the snapshot would show everything - including the Chinese translations for all element you bothered to translate.  This would also have the benefit that the \"translated\" profile could be used as a base for a variety of constraint profiles.  Obviously if you wanted to refine the definitions or usage notes in any of the constrained profiles, you could do that.</p>\n<p>There <em>may</em> actually be a mechanism to leverage the Chinese translations that have been made to the base specification (i.e. here: <a href=\"https://github.com/wanghaisheng/fhir-cn/blob/source/README.md\">https://github.com/wanghaisheng/fhir-cn/blob/source/README.md</a>).  However, I'm not sure if we have the machinery in place to support that yet.  (If not, it's definitely on our 'list of things to do when we have bandwidth'...)  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> may have more information/ideas.</p>",
