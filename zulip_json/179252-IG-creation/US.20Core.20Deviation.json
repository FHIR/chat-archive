Got this link from the webinar today <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process</a>, but I am not following how to even do step 1. Is there a link for where we add a new tracker item? Who are the CGP co-chairs who we need to email? #newbie cc: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"238353\">@Mark Roberts</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"416067\">@Joshua Kelly</span></p>",
