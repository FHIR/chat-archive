Going too many levels results in a large file, which some tooling rejects.</p>\n<p>Tooling also appears to be particular about various conventions (and many tools disagree), so I'm trying to build in options for those.</p>\n<p>Overall, I am confident in building out good tooling, but less confident in having things like canonical versions of the output.</p>",
