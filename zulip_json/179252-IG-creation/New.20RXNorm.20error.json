It turned out that was a 6 hour process, and I just verified that it completed successfully when I got up this morning.  I'm able to $validate-code and $lookup the '1659929' code this morning, so I assume you must have run into a temporary issue with it during the import. :(  Check it out again now and see if it's working for you.</p>",
