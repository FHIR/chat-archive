But... I <em>think</em> SUSHI does the right thing here.  There is a difference between the canonical base for an IG and the canonical URL for the IG resource.  And I think it is correct for the canonical URL of the IG resource to end in <code>/ImplementationGuide/${packageId}</code>.  I think you'll find this pattern in nearly all (if not ALL) HL7 IGs.
