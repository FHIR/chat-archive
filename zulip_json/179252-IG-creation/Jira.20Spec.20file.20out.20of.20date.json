If you process it that way, then none of the history of tracker items against the 'old' name carries forward to the 'new' item.  The only way to address it is for a human being to look at the content.  Also, sometimes you don't <em>want</em> all of the artifacts listed.  For example, in the core spec, there are pages for every single value set and code system - but we don't define artifacts for those - instead feedback is tracked against the associated resources or the 'terminologies' page.  That's a better experience for users dealing with the dropdowns and reflects the granularity at which committees manage maturity.  (Terminology is driven by resource maturity.)  Unfortunately, most work groups haven't really bothered with that capability as part of uploading their files.  I'm not sure if the new process will make that better.</p>",
