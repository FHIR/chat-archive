There was an old ballot version which still shows up in package-list with current = false. There is not an active ballot so it seems that should not go in to the Jira artifacts. Which should I do:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add the Feb 2020 ballotUrl back into the Jira Artifacts xml</li>\n<li>Remove or otherwise edit the package-list.json so it does not show up in the generated jira artifacts</li>\n<li>add an ignorewarinings with a comment as to the reason</li>\n<li>something else</li>\n</ol>",
