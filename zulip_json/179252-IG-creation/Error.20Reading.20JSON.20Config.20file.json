Not sure what happened with your commit, the ig.ini file looked binary or something, it was definitely weird. Anyway, it should work now. Also in ToF the Git integration seems to work as expected - it gives me a list of all the repos connected to my Git account. So maybe you logged in wrong - maybe try logging out and logging back in again?</p>",
