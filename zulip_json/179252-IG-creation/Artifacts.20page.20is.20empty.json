What parts of that need to be addressed.  You can switch on and off feature with status codes (tabs)  and front matter (to top arrow,  section numbering).  All in kramdown markdown ( which means html too ), liquid, and bootstrap.    Easy to customize menus,  images, logos, accordian style content, add your own css.</p>\n<p>My issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have is not being able to turn off and what gets injected into the profiles  (intro, summary, search) without changing the FrontMatter in sd.html so that part is clunky and so I create the includes out of the box to prevent build failure.</li>\n<li>I do think the css could use a an upgrade especially ##### and ######,</li>\n<li>I tried to put the TOC in the left margin but gave up.   (the menu must stay on top since that is FHIR defined real estate.)</li>\n<li>Being able to generate a TOC across pages from the published output instead creating before hand would be fantastic.</li>\n<li>Figure how to develop the history and change logs in the IG but publish separately  ( GG gets grumpy because I always stick em in there )</li>\n<li>My ultimante is goal is to inject swagger/openapi  content inline and be able to run something like a postman collection right from the IG.</li>\n<li>generate python models dynamically ;-)</li>\n</ul>",
