        "content": "<p><a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a> seems to be up, but it's not responding to pings.  That's a problem, because the build process pings <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a> before deciding whether to try running the publisher without a terminology server.  It's working some of the time, so I suspect there might be some sort of DoS protection that causes the server to ignore pings from the same source in semi-close proximity.  E.g. kicking off a build, having it fail, making a change, and kicking it off again.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span>, is there anything we can do here?</p>",
