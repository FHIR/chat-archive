Looks like these are profiles with a base definition of a StructureDefinition of kind \"logical\". Here is one example: <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cda-ccda-2.2/StructureDefinition-2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.5.1.profile.json.html\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cda-ccda-2.2/StructureDefinition-2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.5.1.profile.json.html</a><br>\nI think this is the base definition here: <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/CDA-core-2.0/StructureDefinition-PN.profile.json.html\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/CDA-core-2.0/StructureDefinition-PN.profile.json.html</a><br>\nThis seems to create a resource type of PN, which is not a resource defined by FHIR. <br>\nIt is more confusing in this example as I believe patient name is meant to be a complex type. Maybe it is just because I have not worked in this area of the spec much and not familiar with this CDA  work.</p>\n<p>I was just curious if there was a quick way to determine if an SD derives from a FHIR standard resource or something outside, without having to know and compare against all known FHIR resources. It is not a huge task, just another set of data I have to collect, store, and test against.</p>",
