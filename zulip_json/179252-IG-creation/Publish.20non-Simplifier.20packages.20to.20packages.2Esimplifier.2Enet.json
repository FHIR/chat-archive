Via the Simplifier route the only way right now is to create the package from your project via the UI.</p>\n<p>As Grahame refers to, there are many other package feeds that are (or should be) picked up by the <a href=\"http://packages.fhir.org\" title=\"http://packages.fhir.org\">packages.fhir.org</a> package registry, which brings all the feeds together.
