It seems like something has broken in the Jekyll site build portion of the publisher. I'm not sure if the cause is in the template or the publisher code.  The build errors are due to certain assets (e.g. fhir.css, many of the images needed to build the snapshot tree view) not being found. </p>\n<p>I've attached my publisher terminal output here: <br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/VTcTs54ahHjBg8k4jrjhglwq/ig-publisher.log\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ig-publisher.log\">ig-publisher.log</a></p>",
