The relevant bit in the response seems to be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The latter I don't know how we can fix. For security reasons, we need to tell the built-in Java XML parser to turn on non-default settings to increase the parsing security. I don't believe that there's a public API for doing that, only the private ones.</p>\n<p>Are you able to find any Java 9 advice on how to turn on the XML security features with the built-in xml parser using only public calls in Java 9?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That being the case, it's probably not worth the effort to update POI.  If you (and everyone else) are using Java 8, it sounds like it might be unwise for us to try Java 10 during pre-ballot crunch time.</p>",
