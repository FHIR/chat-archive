I basically overlooked this; there'll be a message in the log pointing out that this is unpredictable but trying to go ahead. But since there's nothing in qa.html about it, people haven't really paid attention. </p>\n<p>Also, I haven't paid enough attention to not referencing current in the IGs.</p>\n<p>So, for example hl7.fhir.us.davinci-deqm#1.0.0 (3.0) depends on hl7.fhir.us.cqfmeasures#1.0.0 (4.0), and hl7.fhir.us.cqfmeasures#1.0.0 depends on hl7.fhir.us.qicore#<strong>current</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>I have a different version mismatches question. I updated the Risk Adjustment IG to dependsOn USCore 3.1.1 (version that is named in regulations). The RA IG also dependsOn DEQM 3.0.0 because we reuse an Extension defined there. However, the DEQM 3.0.0 dependsOn USCore 3.1.0. In a profile (e.g., <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-ra/StructureDefinition-ra-measurereport.html\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-ra/StructureDefinition-ra-measurereport.html</a>) where we reference USCore Patient, it looks like the IG publisher chose to point to the version of USCore Patient from the USCore 3.1.0 instead of  3.1.1. Is this by design of the publisher to choose the older version if there are mismatches? Is there a way to set at a profile level to indicate which version of profiles to reference in this scenario?</p>",
