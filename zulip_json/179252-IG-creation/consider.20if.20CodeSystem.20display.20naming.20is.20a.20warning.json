The IG mainly consists of example document bundles in three different lanugages where the different sections all are marked up with a code from a code system. So far so good. I've started to add the codes to the (newly created) codesystems but was I just found out is that the IG publisher validates the display text from the code as well. Since the document bundles which represents the same text - but in different languages - it does not make sense to validate against the display text from a code in a codesystem as the display text varies from language to language - hence, if validation should have occured, it should have been against a designation and its proper use/value - and not the display value as my display value varies. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> inputs? I guess that I'm basically saying that the display text being the 'default text' is of little use as it is not multifaceted in terms of being able to support multiple languages at the same time.</p>",
