We are using a mapping tool to produce our mappings and it doesn't know FHIR natively, so the mappings are basically XML to XML (or XML to JSON).

There a lots of ways to do the same XSLT - push, pull, named templates, modes, functions etc. Unless the XSLT was very standardised (which it may be is if it itself generated), or largely table driven.  Also I am not sure what it gains you, since XSLT is already executable.<br>\nEasiest would be to derive both XSLT and FML from the same mapping source. <br>\nCan you dump the \"rules\"?</p>",
