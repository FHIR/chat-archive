I don't see how I can control that in the downloads.md import.</p>\n<p>This maybe a leftover from Lloyd's framework which, perhaps, no longer works?</p>",

However, the download.md was not something I wrote though it is in my pages directory. It is the original and I guess it needs updating. Hope to find an md example. I am no shining star with respect to html.</p>",

Maybe it has a different name. I will grab one of the Da Vinci download pages instead.</p>",
