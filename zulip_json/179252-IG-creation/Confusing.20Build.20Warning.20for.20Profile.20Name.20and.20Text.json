A resource should have narrative for robust management [text.div.exists()] <br>\n----- The narrative is generated by the ig publisher and it  exists in the XML generated from the spreadsheet. So not sure why this warning is being generated. </p>\n<p>2. Name should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such as code generation [name.matches('<a href=\"http://[A-Za-z0-9_]\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://[A-Za-z0-9_]\">A-Z</a>{0,254}')]<br>\n--- Again this exists in the XML generated and looks right.
