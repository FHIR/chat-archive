        "content": "<p>Here's an update on where we are with the <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a> terminology service.  We've managed to get the server up and running again today - but not on a continuous and consistent basis.  Looking at it with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"248736\">@Mark Iantorno</span> and then further with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191832\">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"222054\">@Gino Canessa</span>, we determined that one issue was that the database was able to grab too much of the available RAM, and we were then able to limit that which helped to solve a part of the problem.  It didn't solve the underlying issue that the server process itself is using excessive and progressive amounts of RAM that eventually exceed the available limits, resulting in periodic and now quite frequent server crashes and need for restarts.  Fortunately, Gino has been able to make some further updates to the monitor logic so that it can handle those situations more gracefully and can successfully restart the server (in all or at least nearly all cases).  We don't yet know why the service memory use seems to have increased so significantly quite recently, so that still needs more investigation and ultimate mitigation.</p>\n<p>But with all of that, we've now reached a semi-stable situation where we seem maybe to have a temporary path forward.  What we're seeing now is that when the service is restarted it is able to run for a variable amount of time, which is seeming mostly to be from about 10 to 30 minutes (again not sure why there is that variability, but there is).  Once the server hits the memory limit and crashes, that will be detected and the service will be restarted, and the restart process seems to consistently take about 7 minutes.  So the overall server uptime is fluctuating between about 59% to 81%.  That's not good at all, but it might provide enough availability for us to work with for the most part until we can come up with a better long term solution.  If that kind of availability isn't sufficient in some cases, then for now probably the best alternative will be to explore using an alternative terminology server (like Ontoserver) for the IG builds (at least for the local ones) - I'm assuming that the CI build probably may need to stay with <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a>, as long as it remains usable at all (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191315\">@Josh Mandel</span>?).</p>\n<p>Let me or any of us know if you have more questions, and particularly good suggestions.  Thanks for everyone's patience!</p>",
