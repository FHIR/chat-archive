        "content": "<p>I expect that it's treating these as errors because the bindings are required (and presumably for those it expects to know the codes).  One way to solve it might be to change the value of CodeSystem.content for <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/CodeSystem-AHANUBCRevenueCodes.html\">NUBC Revenue Codes</a> to 'fragment' (instead of 'not-present') and then include just the codes that you are using in the examples in the code system fragment.  If you do that you I believe you shouldn't get an error.  And if you want to do that, I think you should discuss that with HTA and at least make them aware (doing that probably should be legitimate, but it would be good to verify that).</p>",
