Users should not have to navigate away from their current page to access the table of contents. Would it be possible to have the \"Table of Contents\" menu be a pop-up menu (with a search field), rather than a completely separate page? For example: <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/YeL1SYn-NDqEElViflCT54RC/image.png\">image.png</a><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/YeL1SYn-NDqEElViflCT54RC/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/YeL1SYn-NDqEElViflCT54RC/image.png\"></a></div></li>\n<li>The table of contents's \"Artifact Summary\" should also include groups defined in the IG's resources (also shown in above \"mock screenshot\").</li>\n<li>If groupings are defined in the IG's resources, then the Artifact Index should be split up into separate pages for each grouping. For larger IGs, the artifact index will be <em>very large</em>, and unwieldy.</li>\n<li>The \"Detailed Descriptions\" should show the <code>short</code> field, as well as <code>definition</code>.</li>\n</ol>",

Why have a table of contents if it's not going to be used? Sometimes people know exactly what they're wanting to get at, and just need to quickly get at it without going through some sort of hierarchy of pages or other content that reference it.

But a good IG should never <em>rely</em> on the ToC as the primary means of navigation (nor should it rely on prev/next links).  When you go to read the Java spec (or most other technical specs), you don't generally worry about the ToC - in fact, I'm not sure if it even has one.  And there's certainly no next/previous link.  Instead, a combination of menus, panels and links within the body allow you to get wherever you need to go, with a fallback of 'search' if you're looking with something net new.</p>",
