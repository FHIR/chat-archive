I am a complete newbie when it comes to the IG Publisher and I ran into a lot of issues so I don't recall how that was addressed. It might have been as simple as downloading the latest version of the publisher. If this error comes at that point where it is trying to validate versions I think I fresh download is needed.</p>\n<p>I looked back at some of the many posts I made in the past days and that was one of them. Grahame responded saying he fixed that bug just a few hours ago. So it looks like you need to download the latest version or at least a newer version than the one you have.</p>",

It was working fine for me and I made a change in a structure definition and now the IG publisher says it can't find the resource. For some reason it is looking not at my local resources but on the fhir server. I do not know why.</p>\n<p>In your case, it could be the error has been brought back. It looks like the publisher goes on line to get the base information (basically that fat tgz file). That is likely changing as they develop the guide (and the spec). One can download the tgz file and I am pretty sure there is a way to point the publisher to the local file. This may protect us from inconsistencies resulting from spec changes.</p>\n<p>But right now I am in a similar boat. It was working fine as of 30 minutes ago. But now I get this error saying it cant find my struct definition. Nothing in the ig.json or ImplementationGuide.xml file has been changed. I don't get it. I am going to try a new download of the jar and see what happens.</p>",
