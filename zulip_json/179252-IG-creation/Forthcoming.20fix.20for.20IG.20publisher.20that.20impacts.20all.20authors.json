        "content": "<p>@all </p>\n<p>There's what I think of as a bug in the IG publisher, which I'm about to fix. The fix may impact IG source. </p>\n<p>The bug is that the content in <code>path.specification</code> in ig.json gets used in several places, all of which I append a \"/\" to if it is no present. Except one. So it doesn't matter whether you specify \"<code>http://build.fhir.org</code>\" or \"<code>http://build.fhir.org/</code>\". Except for what goes in <code>{{site.data.fhir.path}}</code> in Jekyll - that doesn't have a / appended. So this line:</p>\n<p><code>&lt;a href=\"{{site.data.fhir.path}}profiling.html#representation\"&gt;Description of Profiles, Differentials, and Snapshots&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Whether this generates correctly or not depends on the value in the ig.json. Here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to update the code so that <code>{{site.data.fhir.path}}</code> always finishes with a /. I've searched all the igs that are in the FHIR space for {{site.data.fhir.path}}/ and I don't see any. I will correct all the published guides on <a href=\"http://hl7.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org\">hl7.org</a> for this retrospectively as much as I can.</p>\n<p>But if your IG is outside the HL7 space, and you have  {{site.data.fhir.path}}/ in the source, you'll have to fix it yourself</p>",
