That was in the description but I've removed it in the past few hours (like probably 6 hours ago). (The whole description has been udpated, but that is the easiest difference to see).</p>\n<p>Not sure why it's still there - if you take a look at the StructureDefinition for the resource and do a search for \"TODO\" it definitely isn't anywhere.
