However, this also means that a page doesn't render until everything for the page has been received and processed.  This delay can be significant if you're on a slow connection, if there is 'code rendering' that needs to happen (particularly noticeable for RDF), etc.</p>\n<p>Personally, I don't find the jitter that this smoothing was intended to address.  (To see an example, just load <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir\">http://hl7.org/fhir</a> - you'll see the heading shifts right a few hundred milliseconds after it first opens.)  I find the delay to display injected by the fade-in/fade-out process much more problematic.  I would therefore like to roll-back the 'smoothing' process.  However, I agreed with Eric that I'd raise the issue here first to get a broader consensus on the change.</p>",
