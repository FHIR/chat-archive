But I believe for all of the ones that are generating the messages (I haven't checked every instance yet) we do have an explicit link to an example instance declared in ImplementationGuide.definition.resource.exampleCanonical.  At one point after this started to be checked we had all of these messages resolved, but then they reappeared.  I'm not seeing other warnings or errors suggesting that something is invalid.  So I'm not sure why these messages are being generated?  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>?</p>",
