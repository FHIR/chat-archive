What happens if, like in this example, I need a pattern on <code>identifier</code> to satisfying the slicing criteria (which slices by <code>pattern</code> on <code>$this</code>) -- but I also need to mark something like <code>identifier.type</code> as must-support, or I want to require <code>identifier.value</code>, or even just define a <code>short</code> on <code>identifier.value</code>?  All of those would require us to \"walk into the element.\"</p>",
