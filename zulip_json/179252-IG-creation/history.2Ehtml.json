Sorry if this is a naive question, but I didn't find an answer when I went looking earlier.</p>\n<p>So, my question is about how <code>history.html</code> is supposed to be generated for new specs.</p>\n<p>I have finally gotten my IG <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/smart-web-messaging/qa.html\">qa.html</a> to be silent, but I'm still unclear how my <a href=\"https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-web-messaging/history.html\">history.html</a> is supposed to be populated and published.  Is this something that will happen automatically the first time the IG is published on <a href=\"http://hl7.org\">hl7.org</a>?  Or do I need to craft a page in advance?  Either way, I'm surprised that the publisher doesn't mention the broken history link in <code>qa.html</code>.</p>",
