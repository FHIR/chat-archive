I see in the resources folder the links in ig-new.json and ig-new.xml to the resources that should be loaded for the IG, and although I added the paths for the additional material, the code system.xhtml fragments for the 2 code systems in question are not being created in temp during the build (so there is a failure later when they are references in the html and md tab control files).   Do these paths need to be compiled into the jar file, or are they read when it runs?</p>",
