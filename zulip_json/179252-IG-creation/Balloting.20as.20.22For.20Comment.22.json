For comment ballots are not allowed as \"practice runs\" because that places an unnecessary burden on our ballot community.  Content shouldn't ever go to ballot unless the sponsoring WG considers the material fully implementable and ready to publish as an STU at the time of the ballot.</p>\n<p>There's no need to update the PSS.  You'll need to do an NIB (and you'll have to have an approved IG proposal).  When the FMG reviews the NIB, you'll have to convince them that the \"for comment\" ballot is necessary.</p>",
