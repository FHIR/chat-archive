My team extensively uses PHIN VADS in conjunction with the CDC for projects and we were wondering if you were able to share how you were able to create those ValueSets, like if it's a script or something that converts them, so we could use it for some of the recently updated value sets as well as possibly share with the CDC the process that the community has been using to handle PHIN VADS in FHIR-related works.</p>",
