I spent a lot of time trying to find what was wrong with that item but it turned out to be something else in the same xml file but not there.  I am writing all the xml by hand so it is easy to make such errors. Too many times one can see 2+2=2 and not catch it.  I would carefully check then this suggestion is probably a waste of time.</p>",
