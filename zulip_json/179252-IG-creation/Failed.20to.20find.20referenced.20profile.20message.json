I would look at the specific references in the IG that the messages seem to indicate, but, as I said before, I don't know where they are (if these \"references\" actually even exist).  The resources that are listed adjacent to these messages don't have any reference at all to the specified \"referenced profile\" in the message - so I don't really know where else at this point to look for something.  I think I may have to deconstruct the code to figure it where this is coming from, and I haven't done that yet.</p>",
