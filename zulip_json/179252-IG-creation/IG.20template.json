I'm looking for a \"your project name goes here, your resources there\" kind of thing. <br>\n(Sorry if that has already been answered, but i wasn't able to find anything on Zulip or on the IG Publisher HL7 wiki page.)<br>\n(<a href=\"https://wiki.hl7.org/FHIR_IG_publisher_templates\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://wiki.hl7.org/FHIR_IG_publisher_templates\">This</a> exists but the links are broken...)</p>",
