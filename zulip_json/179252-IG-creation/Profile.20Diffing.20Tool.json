Can you remind me where that tool lives and if any further developments have been made or are planned for this capability.  I'm especially interested in being able to compare two profiles on the same resource, then comparing two versions of the same profile (a newer version to a prior version) to easily see what has changed.</p>",

Reason is that I've tried running this with validator_cli.jar and it wasn't able to find the resource files.  For example, this generates an error: <code>java -jar validator_cli.jar -version 4.0 -compare -dest . -left StructureDefinition-mcode-cancer-patient-STU1.json -leftName CancerPatientSTU1 -right StructureDefinition-mcode-cancer-patient-STU2.json -rightName CancerPatientSTU2 -ig hl7.fhir.us.mcode#current -ig hl7.fhir.us.core</code> of file not found. And I have both the validator jar and the resource files to compare in the same directory.</p>",
