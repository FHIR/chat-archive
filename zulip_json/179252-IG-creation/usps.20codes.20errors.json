It's good to get the missing codes added and that will solve the immediate need.  But there are a couple of things that I'm still looking at.  The value set for this in STU3 (<a href=\"https://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/valueset-usps-state.html\">https://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/valueset-usps-state.html</a>) was removed in R4 and CI - and presumably is replaced by the US Core value set (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-usps-state\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-usps-state</a>), as this is a US-specific terminology?  That seems rather straightforward.  The other question that I have is regarding the url.  The \"<a href=\"https://www.usps.com/\">https://www.usps.com/</a>\" url is the home page for the USPS organization, and doesn't have anything to do specifically with the state abbreviations at all (and we don't normally use the \"https\" prefix).  I assume that this url wasn't ever vetted in any way with the USPS for this use - and undoubtedly it was chosen before the role of HTA in managing this came about?  Similar to our recent discussions for NUCC, presumably (whether we continue to use this particular url or not) we should also go through the HTA process with these \"state abbreviation\" codes?</p>",
