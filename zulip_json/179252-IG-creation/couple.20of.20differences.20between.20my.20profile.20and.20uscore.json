Is that an option in the publisher I can use?</p>\n<p>2) My Patient adds <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-AD-use\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-AD-use\">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-AD-use</a> and inherits <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-birthsex\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-birthsex\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-birthsex</a> from Us Core.  I noticed that in the differential view, it lists the binding for the AD-use, but does not list the binding for us-core-birthsex.  Any idea why that is?  is it because it is not different from the UsCore patient?  but in that case why does it show up at all?</p>",
