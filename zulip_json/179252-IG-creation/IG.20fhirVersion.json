It looks like this element needs to be filled out to the patch level, so, how can I say an IG or profile works with R4 rather than 4.0.1? I can obviously fill in 4.0.0, and 4.0.1, but that doesn't help me when 4.0.2 or R4C is released (and with which it should be compatible, assuming FHIR follows it's compatibility rules).</p>\n<p>I'm confused by the element definition as well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>this is the formal version of the specification, without the revision number, e.g. [publication].[major].[minor]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I thought <em>[minor]</em> was the revision number. What does a version of the spec look like with a revision number?</p>\n<p>Also,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A StructureDefinition does not need to specify the target it applies to as StructureDefinitions will often be valid across multiple versions of FHIR. FHIR tooling can determine whether a StructureDefinition is consistent with a particular StructureDefinition if desired.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does this imply that for profiles, it may be best to omit the fhirVersion in the SD? (It can't be omitted in the ImplementationGuide due to cardinality constraints, and an invariant.)</p>",
