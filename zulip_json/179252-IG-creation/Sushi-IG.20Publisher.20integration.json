Executing SUSHI from the CLI the \"normal\" way will first generate FHIR sources (including batch scripts) and then you can run the IG Publisher jar... but if you're <em>not</em> running SUSHI directly, then you need the jar first (since the jar will run SUSHI) and you won't necessarily have _genonce at that point.  But... I can see what you mean; as written, it does seem it might be overly prescriptive.</p>",
