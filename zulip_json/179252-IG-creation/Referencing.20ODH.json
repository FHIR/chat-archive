I can only see a CI build (that hasn't been updated in a year) and the ballot site - also from a year ago. <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/odh/history.cfml\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/odh/history.cfml\">http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/odh/history.cfml</a> </p>\n<p>Is it \"legal\" to include references to profiles that haven't been published? I couldnt' even find a validator.pack file though to use (I _think_ I would need that file to get the dependency to work?)</p>\n<p>Need some advice on how to proceed with this...</p>",
