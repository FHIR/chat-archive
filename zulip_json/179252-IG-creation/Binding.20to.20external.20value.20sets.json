I thought this would be great to do as it means that the value set isn't tied to the IG (i.e. all codes hard coded in a value set in the IG forever) and as long as the link doesn't mention a version, it's like a dynamic binding.</p>\n<p>However once I actually use a code from the value set in an example the IG Publisher gives you a warning:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>warning ValueSet https://phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/ViewValueSet.action?oid=2.16.840.1.114222.4.11.4239 not found by validator\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This never came up in the ODH IG because they didn't include any examples.</p>\n<p>Are these warnings acceptable for publication? Is this an \"approved\" way of binding to value sets? Is there a better way to achieve what I want to achieve (ability to link to a valueset that is likely to change)?</p>",
