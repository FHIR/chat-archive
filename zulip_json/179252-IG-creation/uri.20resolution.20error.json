Resolution might be to a web page that describes the identifier system and/or supports look-up of identifiers. Alternatively, it could be to a <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/namingsystem.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/namingsystem.html\">NamingSystem</a> resource instance. Resolvable URLs are generally preferred by implementers over non-resolvable URNs, particularly opaque URNs such as OIDs (urn:oid:) or UUIDs (urn:uuid:). If used, OIDs and UUIDs may be registered in the HL7 OID registry  and SHOULD be registered if the content is shared or exchanged across institutional boundaries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am going to remove from this instance since not required in Profile But it would be nice to know whether the Device definition and thus this uri value is wrong or the validator is being too strict here.</p>",
