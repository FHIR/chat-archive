All artifacts from all imported IGs are <em>available</em> but they're not listed, in part because we don't have any mechanism of telling the IG which ones are relevant (that typically won't be all of them).  You can either have an external pointer to the artifacts page (or equivalent page(s)) in the target IG or you can manually define your own list of external links.  We've talked about adding a mechanism to 'import' artifacts from a referenced IG and publish them as if they were local, but there's some tricky things with making that work and we haven't had time to fully explore it.</p>",
