There is no problem for the IG, it gets the correct codes for the main valueSet. <br>\nBut when in examples when I use one of the code, I get error \"Unable to find value set xxx\".<br>\nHere is my CI build: <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/ec-ehealth/Build-source/\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/ec-ehealth/Build-source/</a><br>\nThe main VS is allergyintolerancecode which includes causativeagent and noallergy. In allergyintolerance profile, if I change to directly access causativeagent or noallergy, I don't get any error. Any idea how to solve that?</p>",
