The canonical profile URIs (e.g. <a href=\"http://fhir.logicahealth.org/covid19/StructureDefinition/covid-19-exposure-questionnaire\">http://fhir.logicahealth.org/covid19/StructureDefinition/covid-19-exposure-questionnaire</a>) we don't want to change, but we host at a different URL, and the \"Directory of published versions\" link seems to be generated from the canonical as a base. How can this be changed?</p>",
