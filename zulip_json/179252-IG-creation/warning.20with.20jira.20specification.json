A proposed revised file to be reviewed and, if appropriate, submitted as a pull request against the XML folder in <a href=\"https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts\">https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts</a>. To see the differences, perform a file compare on 'template/jiraspec.tmp.xml' (currently in Github) and 'jira.xml' (reflects current IG content)\". The CI Build for the ballot is a branch, since the main branch is ready for publication but not yet officially published. I tried to revert the change made to the jira spec repo but it didn't let me remove a version. I don't believe a Jira issue has been created to link to this new ballot version. How should this warning be resolved?@<strong>Grahame Grieve</strong> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span></p>",
