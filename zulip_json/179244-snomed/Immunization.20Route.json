This anatomical site value is not trivially implied by the qualifier alone but is required to compute the equivalence between, for example:</p>\n<p>34206005 Subcutaneous route (qualifier value)<br>\n386362006 Administration of drug or medicament via subcutaneous route (procedure)</p>\n<p>Although other parts of the same FHIR message may represent the anatomical site of the injection, if this is captured more generally as e.g. </p>\n<p>362677002 Entire buttock (body structure)</p>\n<p>...then this still won't allow you to detect the equivalence between a pair of [route + site] codes carried by more than one FHIR element and the alternative of carrying one of the procedure codes above, <em>unless</em> the site was more specifically captured as:</p>\n<p>52435007 Subcutaneous tissue structure of buttock (body structure)</p>",
