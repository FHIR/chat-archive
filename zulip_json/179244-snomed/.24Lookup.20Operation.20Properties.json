        "content": "<p>Today's SNOMED on FHIR call ended with a discussion on the nature of the Necessary Normal Form expression that the Using SNOMED CT With FHIR page specifies should be returned when a normalForm, or normalFormTerse, property is requested by a $lookup operation. Leaving aside the active debate on how to generate these expressions, an overarching question was put to the group - how are clients expected to use these expressions? Aside from purely decorative display purposes, the Group had no further use cases, so we are seeking input from the broader FHIR implementation community. Prior to the July 2018 release of SNOMED CT, normal form expressions could be used for equivalence testing but, due to structural changes in the terminology, that is no longer the case (a Classifier is required). Are there any other requirements for using these expressions?</p>",
