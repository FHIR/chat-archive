        "content": "<p>Anesthesia WG is looking for advice on the best way to record scores on  clinical assessment scales such as GCS, POSSUM, SOFA etc. Often, these assessments have sub-scales. We're not sure what is the best approach to represent the overall score and also the individual sub-scale scores. We're working with the SNOMED CT Anesthesia CRG to try to ensure that supporting concepts are available. Not sure what is the best way to record assessment scores using FHIR 'Observation' resource. Options we're considering are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Use the SNOMED CT Compositional Grammar to capture both the overall score and the sub-scores then put the resulting string in the Code element of the FHIR Observation resource </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use the Observation resource 'Code' element to capture the overall assessment and Observation-&gt;Component(s) to note the sub-scale results </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use one instance of the Observation resource to record the overall assessent and link other instances to record the sub-scale scores.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any advice much appreciated.</p>",
