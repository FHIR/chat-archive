Don't know how it has progressed but I would get onto Snomed to see how it was going. I think there was stuff in pcs which was missing in snomed  but as stated ask Snomed directly (you can find email addreses on their website which will resolve to people who can help).</p>",

Kin Wah Fung at the NLM has been involved in this and the other ICD-10 to SNOMED CT mapping projects and has made several presentations and written papers on this, and I expect he may be in the best position to know the current state of it at the moment.
