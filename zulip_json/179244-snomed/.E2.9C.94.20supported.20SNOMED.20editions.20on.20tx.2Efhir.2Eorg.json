They're not so easy to document and have you reproduce, though (yet).  I'm working on further code updates but haven't submitted PR(s) for them yet - but I will soon.  You may have to do the imports and see where it's failing.  I've worked through some further issues with the loading of the concepts, and the main issue(s) that I'm tracking down now are happening in the cross-relationship processing - I'm seeing those issues in ftx_sct_importer SaveConceptLinks, where I'm getting \"no roots found\" errors.  I have <strong>only</strong> seen that in the latest work that I've been doing on importing the extension releases \"on top\" of the specified International edition.  I've never seen that in importing an edition directly.  At the point in the process that these errors are occurring, the import tool is using &gt; 100 GB RAM on my Windows 10 VM (and that isn't maxed out, so it's not due to an \"out of memory\" issue).</p>",
