The main concern of the SI staff on the call seemed to be creation of new records using this code system which is deprecated and should not be used (as you note in your comment above). I don't think there was dissent on that being the right thing, but there are for example existing imaging machines that still do this despite DICOMs policy and changes, which is essentially impossible to control.</p>\n<p>At any rate there was support for defining something (probably <a href=\"http://snomed.info/srt\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://snomed.info/srt\">http://snomed.info/srt</a>) because even if there weren't new records being created with these codes (which is bad) there is a body of existing legacy data which needs to be represented somehow.</p>",

I guess they don't fall in the category of SNOMED RT codes that can be treated as SNOMED CT codes (something like: SNOMED RT code for \"Carotid Artery\": \"T-45010\", corresponding SNOMED CT code: \"69105007\").<br>\nWould using a proprietary system URL for the SNOMED RT codes make sense which are no valid SCTIDs? Or are you aware of any non-SNOMED managed proprietary system URL for non-valid-SCTID-SNOMED RT codes (such as \"T-45010\") that one can use?<br>\nThanks a lot and best wishes,<br>\nDavid</p>",

One point that Linda Bird makes in her response, is that the legacy alphanumeric SNOMED identifiers are not \"SNOMED RT\" codes/identifiers, but are actually \"SNOMED 3.x\" identifiers.  I think we need to try to keep that straight and use those labels as consistently as possible, in order to avoid confusion.  I'm not thinking of any other discussion that has occurred on this since 2018.  I assume that probably something may be needed to handle this in FHIR, for the mapping of legacy SNOMED 3.x coded data.  But I am curious what anyone who actually has a need for that has been doing with it over the past 4 years, when we haven't really yet landed on a specific agreed solution.</p>",
