It seems to both Jane and I that these elements should have strong mappings between FHIR and SNOMED CT, and that to progress this we need a solid focused discussion between HL7 (PC/Vocab) and SNOMED.  </p>\n<p>We cast around for options to do a face to face to this, and are proposing to our respective communities that there's a window of opportunity for us to meet in Amsterdam on Nov 19 (day before DevDays Amsterdam) to discuss this - there's a realistic possibility that enough of us from both communities could be present to have a meaningful discussion.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts about this?</p>",
