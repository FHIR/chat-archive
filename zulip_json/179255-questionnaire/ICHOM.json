In addition we have over 1200 questionnaires in our library (and growing). Right now we're implementing a number of v2.x and FHIR based integrations in Singapore with EMRs (SCM and Epic) and using Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse. Happy to share our experiences. I got several questions which I'll post here.</p>",
