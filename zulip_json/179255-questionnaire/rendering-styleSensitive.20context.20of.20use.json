That sounds like the presence of this extension affects the entire Questionnaire.  However, the context of use says \"Use on Element ID Element\", which I think means it could be placed on any part of the Questionnaire, presumably affecting just that piece?  The description and the context of use seem to contradict each other.</p>",
