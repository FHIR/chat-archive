Our SDC app (<a href=\"https://lhcforms.nlm.nih.gov/sdc\">https://lhcforms.nlm.nih.gov/sdc</a>) saves QuestionnaireResponses with links back to the Questionnaire.  (In other words, when you choose \"save as\", it will show you a link to created QuestionnaireResponse, and that will contain a reference to the Questionnaire).  However, if you choose \"Show Form Data As -&gt; QuestionniareResponse\" it does not put the reference in for you.  I think that is because we allow you to upload a new Questionnaire from a file, so it until the save happens, it doesn't (always) have a reference to the Questionnaire instance.  If you are not uploading from a file, it could put the reference there, though.</p>",

The \"code\" search parameter will be dropped and replaced by new ones.  Hopefully this will make it in before R5.  A work-around in the meantime would be to set the id to be the same as the code (if supported by the FHIR server).  We did that with our LOINC panels in our HAPI FHIR servers, e.g. <a href=\"https://lforms-fhir.nlm.nih.gov/baseR4/Questionnaire/44249-1\">https://lforms-fhir.nlm.nih.gov/baseR4/Questionnaire/44249-1</a></p>",
