LinkIds are referenced in expressions in various extensions and may be referenced in external libraries containing expressions too.  (FHIRPath, queries, CQL).  So if you were going to prefix the link id, you'd have to parse all of the expression code to find the linkIds there and inject the prefixes there.  As well, you'd have to create local contained clones of the libraries (and any libraries they inherit from too), propagating the prefixes into all of that code as well.  So for simple cases, it'd be easy.  For complex cases, it'd be super, super evil.  And of course, when you write your code, you always have to account for the possibility of the complex case.</p>",
