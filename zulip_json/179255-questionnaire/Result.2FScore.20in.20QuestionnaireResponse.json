It has a bunch of questions with \"Choice\" type answers. <br>\nThe Scoring of the questionnaire based on each item response is based on a complicated algorithm (in my case Calibrated IRT). As such it wouldn't be possible to store the scoring-logic in Questionnaire. (Im curious though, if the logic were simple math, where would it be in Questionnaire?)</p>\n<p>But lets say that I do arrive on a score number. The question is: Is it wise, to store that score in the <code>QuestionnaireResponse</code> or should I create an <code>Observation</code> and have that be linked with the <code>Questionnaire</code> &amp; <code>QuestionnaireResponse</code>  in some way, Bearing in mind that the score is not the user-generated response but a result calculated by the requesting party (in this case the hospital).</p>",

We'd be happy to have your logic as an example to test with if you wish :)  The logic would be expressed in an extension.  If the score is something that would ideally be printed on the completed form, it can be in the QuestionnaireResponse as a read-only field that is calculated as the form is filled out and/or when the form is complete.  If it's a separate result determined by someone else, then an Observation that has a \"derivedFrom\" relationship to the QuestionnaireResponse would be appropriate.</p>",
