Therefore, I assumed that this element should be used to code the questionnaire itself by e.g. a code for \"Medical History Questionnaire\" and another one for \"Aftercare Questionnaire\" so that in the context of aftercare an application could offer all \"Aftercare Questionnaires\" for the user to select. </p>\n<p>But yes, maybe _code_ could also be used to distinguish \"Questionnaire intended for patient\" from \"Questionnaire intended for healthcare professional\". I just saw that there are multiple codes possible so when we would need both kind of information for a Questionnaire we could assign two codes (one for \"Aftercare Questionnaire\" and one for \"Questionnaire intended for patient\") from two different value sets.</p>\n<p>Thanks, that seems to solve my issue!</p>",
