However, there are two options for getting the Questionnaire definition:<br>\n1) LOINC's FHIR API: <a href=\"https://loinc.org/fhir/\">https://loinc.org/fhir/</a>.  I would try there first.   We found a few issues with their definitions (which they are working on fixing) but they might not affect you.<br>\n2) From our FHIR servers at NLM, e.g. <a href=\"https://lforms-fhir.nlm.nih.gov/baseR4/Questionnaire/34552-0?_format=json\">https://lforms-fhir.nlm.nih.gov/baseR4/Questionnaire/34552-0?_format=json</a>.   These Questionnaires are generated from and older, LHC-Forms format that we also get from LOINC and then convert.  We are planning to transition to LOINC's FHIR output (using that directly, rather than converting to Questionnaire from the older format) when the issues have been worked out.</p>\n<p>There are a few hundred \"convenience group\"/organizer LOINC codes which as I understand are not really stand-alone panels that would be ordered, and there might not be definitions for those.  Anyway, let me know if you have trouble finding the definition you are looking for.</p>",
