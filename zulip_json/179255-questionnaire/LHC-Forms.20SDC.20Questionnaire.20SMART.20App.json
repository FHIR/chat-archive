Prepopulation support now includes the following extensions:  <br>\n- launchContext<br>\n- initialExpression (FHIRPath only)<br>\n- calculatedExpression (FHIRPath only)<br>\n- variable (FHIRPath only)</p>\n<p>The URL is <a href=\"https://apps.smarthealthit.org/app/lforms-questionnaire-app\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://apps.smarthealthit.org/app/lforms-questionnaire-app\">https://apps.smarthealthit.org/app/lforms-questionnaire-app</a>.  Note that this talks to an STU3 server, but you can upload R4 forms, which stay R4 until you save and reload them (at which point the R4 functionality goes away).  Demo forms for upload are in the GitHub repository, at: <a href=\"https://github.com/lhncbc/lforms-fhir-app/tree/master/e2e-tests/data/R4\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lhncbc/lforms-fhir-app/tree/master/e2e-tests/data/R4\">https://github.com/lhncbc/lforms-fhir-app/tree/master/e2e-tests/data/R4</a></p>",

However, if you are looking to do math in STU3, I am not sure what support there is.  The questionnaire-calculatedExpression extension is not in STU3, but is a part of the SDC profile that was  balloted (for comment) with R4 (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/extension-questionnaire-calculatedexpression.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/extension-questionnaire-calculatedexpression.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/extension-questionnaire-calculatedexpression.html</a>).  So, I've only been adding these new features to the R4 import.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> Would it make sense to try to support questionnaire-calculatedExpression (and possibly other new SDC extensions) in STU3?</p>",
