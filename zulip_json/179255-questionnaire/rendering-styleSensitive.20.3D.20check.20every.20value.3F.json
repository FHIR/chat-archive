I am putting off styles on answer lists (ValueSets) for now.  In theory (though SDC does not ask for this) you could put rendering-style on the Questionnaire node, and then any styles you apply there should carry through to the child elements.  At least, that is my understanding how rendering-style is supposed to work, but at least in LHC-Forms support has to be explicitly added for each case.</p>",
