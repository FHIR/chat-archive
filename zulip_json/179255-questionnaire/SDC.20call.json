As mentioned it's a bit rough, we still have some cleaning up to do, and it's stil DSTU2 conformant, not STU3. We'd appreciate any feedback or recommendations you could offer. We are working on updating and cleaning it up, but we thought it was more important to share it with you all. </p>\n<p>Things we'd like to do with this template: <br>\n-Allow for auto-calculations of mean based on length and Width (potentially in the future this might be LxWxH) <br>\n-Allow for auto-calculation of the ACR Lung Rads Score based answers selected by the user (a scoring system like BI-RADS that helps dictate patient management) <br>\n-Embed terminology codes in answers. We use RadLex codes to identify our questions and answers and LOINC to identify section headings</p>",
