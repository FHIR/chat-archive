I am surprised this has not come up before.  It happened to me just last week, that I got a Questionnaire for which some of the ValueSets I have no idea to how to get.  Even for the HL7 ValueSets I was not sure where to go, but I found a source in HAPI FHIR.  For the other lists that are not <a href=\"http://hl7.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org\">hl7.org</a> I have no idea where to look.  I suppose I, as a human, could contact the person who sent me the Questionnaire (which I did), but a program that renders Questionnaires should not have to guess.  I think an extension is needed on item.options (or since I see that is a Reference, perhaps on item).</p>",
