The documentation says the former is a \"few words to short sentence\" while the latter is \"potentially multi-paragraph\". Is the choice of one vs. the other mainly meant as a hint to the UI or does it have \"hard consequences\" on validity etc. -  e.g. are different length restriction applied during validation of a QuestionnaireResponse?</p>",
