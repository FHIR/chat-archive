It has all of the patient's information, explanation of benefits, risks, etc. Would that information be stored in a consent? Or would that information be stored in something like a questionnaire, and if the patient agrees (and signs), then a Consent resource would be created to document &amp; record this action?</p>",

PDF is probably most typical, QuestionnaireResponse second and anything else would be cutting edge/research stage.</p>",
