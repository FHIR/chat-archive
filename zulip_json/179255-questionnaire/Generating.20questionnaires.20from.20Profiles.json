Since we have a lot of the meta-data already in Profiles, is there a way to generate the Questionnaire using the Profile as meta-data, complete with linkIds, enableWhen rules, data types, and cardinality? It does seem possible, but I'm not sure about the loss of validation rules that may occur, and whether there are any implementations of this.</p>\n<p>Extending it a bit, in some use cases a single form might require multiple resources, e.g. the Patient and 1 or more Coverages. We're considering using GraphDefinition for this. Has this solution been explored?</p>",
