I am feeding QuestionnaireResponses according to the SDC profile through the validator. The questionnaire is the COVID-19 surveillance questionnaire from WHO and one output item is: <code>{\n                    \"linkId\": \"patinfo_ageonset\",\n                    \"text\": \"Age (use days if under 1 month, months if under 1 year):\",\n                    \"answer\": [\n                        {\n                            \"valueQuantity\": {\n                                \"value\": 45.0,\n                                \"unit\": \"mo\",\n                                \"system\": \"http://unitsofmeasure.org\",\n                                \"code\": \"mo\"\n                            }\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }</code></p>\n<p>This to me looks like a perfectly valid quantity as a response to a question which asked for a quantity. However, the validator is telling me: <br>\n<code>Error @ QuestionnaireResponse.item[3].item[0].answer[0].value.ofType(Quantity).value (line 82, col47) : This element is not allowed by the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Coding</code></p>\n<p>What makes the validator think that this is a Coding? I am invoking it as follows:<br>\n<code>java -jar validator_cli.jar -version 4.0.1 -ig http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/2019May/ -profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/StructureDefinition/sdc-questionnaireresponse resources/who_response.json</code></p>\n<p>BTW: Are questions around strange validator outputs best asked in the stream that addresses the corresponding profile (SDC), or is this an implementer topic?</p>",

        "content": "<p>That absolutely seems like a but in the validator to me.  I can't see anything wrong in the fragment looking at it and I agree that it's not a coding - though it does have a binding, so it's possible it's getting confused about that somehow.  Bet bet is to submit a Git issue against the validator.</p>",
