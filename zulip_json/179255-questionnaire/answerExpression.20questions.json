(I vote yes.  Even if the answer is in the new list, the user might have picked a different answer if the other answers were different.)<br>\n2) Can an item with answerExpression also have initialExpression?  If so, I suppose answerExpression should be run first, so that if the field does not allow off-list answers, the value produced by initialExpression can be checked against the list (and possibly ignored with some warning).<br>\n3) Can an item with answerExpression also have calculatedExpression?  I think the same approach for (2) could work here.</p>",
