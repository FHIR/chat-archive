Unfortunately the generated instanced are generating errors in our FHIR IG.  I had to remove the examples from the IG last Friday because they were blocking the build.  I would like to add them back into the IG this week, to recreate the problems.  Would you be able to take a look at the errors to see what you think is going wrong, but more important, help us fix the situation so the examples can be added without causing errors.<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span></p>",

I copied the errors into a word document and attached them too.  Thanks for taking a look.  I created the Questionnaire from the LHC tool.  The loinc codes were all missing the system element in the coding, so I added that manually.  You can see the validator is now not happy with the associated display elements.  Other problems too, which I appreciate your assistance deciphering.  <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/u7b8k8J2EGVENu9KLBZ2Obu9/SDOHCC_Questionnaire_HungerVitalSign_1_Example_1.xml\" title=\"SDOHCC_Questionnaire_HungerVitalSign_1_Example_1.xml\">SDOHCC_Questionnaire_HungerVitalSign_1_Example_1.xml</a> <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/CgAICJE0NFiERBslUyst9z2E/Errors-in-the-Questionnaire.docx\" title=\"Errors-in-the-Questionnaire.docx\">Errors-in-the-Questionnaire.docx</a></p>",

This fault existed in the definition I sent you back in February.  The form definition we have from LOINC for this form is does not have that bracketed text, for some reason.  Anyway, the validator is requiring that the display string match the official display string of the LOINC codes.
