We have the ability to control whether an item as a whole should be rendered (so you can suppress certain instructions to the user, or only show calculated scores once editing is finished).  But no one's ever asked to have the item.text suppressed in a rendered form.  Do you have any other instructions beyond the 3 values in your example (LabelWithData, ShowHeader, DataNoLabel)?</p>",

We have also implemented whether to suppress or enable the group header from repeating on repeating groups of questions.</p>",
