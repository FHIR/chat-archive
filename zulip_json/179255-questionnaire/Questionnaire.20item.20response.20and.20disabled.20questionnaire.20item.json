Because of this, we were not able to differentiate whether the answer was for an enabled question.</p>\n<p>So we decided to remove the answer from the questionnaire response if the questionnaire item gets disabled, and once it gets enabled just add an initial value as an answer to the response if present until user inputs it.<br>\nBut then initial value get added over user input once it enabled.<br>\nConsider this edge case<br>\nQuestionnaire item has an initial value, and the user also inputs it. If it gets disabled then the answer gets removed from the response (as per fix), but if it gets enabled again then the initial answer gets added as we already removed answer which was user input.</p>\n<p>Can you please suggest here?</p>\n<p>cc: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"366686\">@Jing Tang</span></p>",

That way if an element previously populated becomes re-enabled due to subsequent answers or revision of previous ones, the data the user filled in isn't lost.  However, once complete, the only items that should have answers are those that are enabled.</p>",
