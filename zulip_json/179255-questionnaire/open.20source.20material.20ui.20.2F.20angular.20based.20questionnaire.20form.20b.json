It is open source, at <a href=\"https://github.com/lhncbc/formbuilder-lhcforms\">https://github.com/lhncbc/formbuilder-lhcforms</a>.  But, I am not sure if you are just looking for re-usable components to use in your own form builder.  I suspect you won't find something like that in our repository; it is not something we planned for.</p>",
