However, we just noticed that some extensions (like <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extension-questionnaire-optionprefix.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extension-questionnaire-optionprefix.html\">optionPrefix</a>) do not say in their \"context of use\" that they can be used on a ValueSet.expansion.contains item.  Can they?  If not, it greatly limits the usefulness of contained ValueSets.
