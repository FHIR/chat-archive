I want to store the answer to Question 1 in a variable to use for expressions used to populate Questions 2, 3 from the 1st group and then Questions 4, 5 and 6 from the 2nd group.   Where do I put the extension with the variable?     I was thinking of putting it on the group  item for the 1st group.   But then, is it only in scope for the 1st group?   Will the expressions in the 2nd group be able to access the variable declared in the 1st group?  Should any variables go at the header level for the Questionnaire?</p>",
