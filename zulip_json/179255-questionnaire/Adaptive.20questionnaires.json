Isn’t it NOT necessary to have contained Questionnaire in the QuestionnaireResponse in the request body of POST [base]/Questionnaire/$next-question?  If the questionnaire (with the defined questions) is known to the External Assessment Center, isn’t it enough the request body to contain QuestionnaireResponse with reference to the questionnaire (not contained Questionnaire) and an item with a response?</li>\n<li>Why the response body of the \"next question\" operation contains contained Questionnaire resource with all items already administered and all answer items previously sent back? If the External Assessment Center has the questionnaire with the questions, and the Patient Facing App is taking care of storing the questions and answers accordingly, isn’t it enough the response to only include the new question in the QuestionnaireResponse.contained (without all items already administered and all answer items previously sent back)?</li>\n</ol>",
