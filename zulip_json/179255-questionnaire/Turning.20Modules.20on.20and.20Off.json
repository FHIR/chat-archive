All patients will complete questions 1-20, but only some patients will complete questions 20-40 as well.</p>\n<p>or do they envision something dynamic?</p>\n<p>eg.  Patient A will complete questions 2, 5, 8, 10-20, 38-39</p>\n<p>Patient B will complete questions 25-30 only</p>\n<p>Patient C will complete questions 1, 3, 19, 27-32</p>\n<p>If they wanted to do something dynamic, I think this is possible as well. The practitioner could complete a questionnaire (\"Assigned Questions Questionnaire\")  with checkboxes for which questions that the specific patient is being assigned to complete.  The Questionnaire Response for the \"Assigned Questions Questionnaire\"  can be passed to the patient's individual questionnaire via the launchContext extension and stored in a variable. The questions in the \"Master Comprehensive Questionnaire\" can have enableWhen extensions on each of them that will use fhirpath to check the variable containing the QR for the Assigned Questions Questionnaire and conditionally enable/disable the questions based on whether or not the practitioner had checked the checkbox when they completed the \"Assigned Questions Questionnaire\".</p>\n<p>There would probably need to be Task resources prompting the practitioner and patient to complete their Questionnaires. I am still learning about Tasks.</p>",

Don't look at me - sounds like a dreadful hack, but that's what they've agreed.</p>",

Western Province Hospital System vs.  Southern Province Hospital System).</p>\n<p>The launchContext extension can pass any resource into the Questionnaire.  It is extensible.
