One of examples creates a Patient resource.  I am wondering if there is some way that new functionality (assuming it makes it into the standard) might get leveraged by one of the SDC data extraction approaches.  Creating a Condition resource in FHIRPath from data in the QuestionnaireResponse would be a lot easier than the StructureMap approach (if less powerful).  One could use the new syntax to create a Condition and put into a variable, but from there I am not sure what one would do to get it extracted.</p>",
