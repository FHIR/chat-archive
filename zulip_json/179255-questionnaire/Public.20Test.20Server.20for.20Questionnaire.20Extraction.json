        "content": "<p>It depends what kind of extraction you want to do, and I suppose in what context.  LHC-Forms currently supports <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/extraction.html#obs-extract\">Observation-based extraction</a>.  The SDC (structured data capture) <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/\">IG</a> also specifies two other two types of extraction which let you extract other types of FHIR resources from a QuestionnaireResponse.  Also, the LHC-Forms Obsevation-based extraction is intended for the case where the user has just filled out the Questionnaire, saves, and you do the extraction right then.  If you had a collection of QuestionnnaireResponses already, and wanted to do extraction in batch processing, you would probably need some other approach.</p>",
