Is the 2019May version the version to go by? looking at the Versions overview, the latest version is a dead link. Beyond that clarification, what I'm after is 1) whether the mentioned three levels of extraction: Observation-based extraction, Definition-based extraction, StructureMap-based extraction is the latest thought in terms of extraction. 2) Also, I'm wondering why there is no mention of active questionnaires in relation to the topic of extraction. I'd appreciate some clarification.</p>",
