The itemExtractionContext is used to set the context for the item.definition paths. If the itemExtractionContext is empty, then the Questionnaire is being used to create a resource. If the itemExtractionContext has a resource (or set of resources), then the Questionnaire is being used to update the resource(s).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What does it mean \"empty\"? </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>An extension without the value?
