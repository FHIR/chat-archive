I am  only building a form filler, so looking to point people towards a good editor to build forms for my filler. I like your editor quite a bit, would like to recommend it. In that combination I should expect that whatever your editor offers will be thrown at my filler. Therefore I am trying to get a complete picture of what might come out of your editor.

I checked with the developer (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"195370\">@Ajay Kanduru</span>), and it looks like there are three custom extensions which (mostly) have equivalents in SDC, so I would not recommend adding support for those, and actually, if Ajay can find time, I think our form builder should stop using those.  Ajay has been very busy working on a redesign and rewrite of the form builder, so it is not at up to date as it would otherwise be, particularly with regard to some of the newer changes (like being able setting an answer list based on another field's value, which our dataControl extension supported).</p>",
