With a mobile questionnaire filler you need rather the semantics of the extensions, rather than a precise layout definition. With Android or iOS you might have to serve all different kinds of screen sizes from a phone in portrait or landscape mode up to a large iPad Pro, and any prescription that something needs to go left, right, or above something else is something you can either ignore, or scale down until it becomes unreadable, or do a lot of wrapping... the same goes for the colours in XHMTL or render-style. The SDC examples that try to be fancy with colours become unreadable on a phone in dark mode (dark blue on dark grey, for instance). Other trouble makers on mobile are the table extensions in group items and the horizontal layout in choice item.</p>",
