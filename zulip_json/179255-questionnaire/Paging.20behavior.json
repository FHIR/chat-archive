The current wording (\"If there are items at the same level as a 'page' group that are listed before the 'page' group, they will be treated as a separate page. \") implies that (unmarked) siblings before the group marked \"page\" would be put together on a single page, not that each sibling would have its own separate page.</p>",

Again I'd much prefer if the IG publisher (or the standard itself) is strict about it (makes my logic to separate items to pages slightly easier) but it's not the end of the world if not.</p>",

Only challenge with the last one is if we introduce additional control types that would also make sense in that mix, however adding them to the constraint wouldn't be considered a breaking change.</p>",
