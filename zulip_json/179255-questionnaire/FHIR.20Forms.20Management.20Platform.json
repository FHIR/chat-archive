I know that US-core (which reflects the intentions of a lot of big multi-national EHR companies, even though it's officially US-centric) is taking relatively shallow steps into the Questionnaire space, with most complex behavior being dealt with through 'adaptive forms'.  Some of the Da Vinci IGs are mandating more sophisticated capabilities involving CQL population and flow control - with a potential for regulatory requirement for those things.  How much that will manifest in commercial offerings is unclear.</p>",

Most non-FHIR forms platforms don't have the population, extraction, and some of the other capabilities that SDC offers.  So if you need those, you need FHIR.  If your requirements are simpler, then the drivers would be the ability to share the forms and responses with systems who don't necessarily use those same commercial solutions.  </p>\n<p>How 'code heavy' your implementation is going to be depends on how much you leverage existing libraries.  There are also generic transformation tools that you can use to convert between XML and JSON syntax, so you're not necessarily doing all of the work in code, though even if using GUI mapping tools, it'd be code-like.</p>",

Depending on your use-case this might be a good starting point, since they do forms lifecycle, plus data analytics, benchmarking, sometimes special study support, incl. FDA compliance. I'm sure they will move towards FHIR APIs, some are already mentioning it (see: <a href=\"https://mrdm.com/platform/\">https://mrdm.com/platform/</a>).</p>",
