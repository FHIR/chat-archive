I realize this is an 'ex-post-facto' use case and it would be helpful to id the pain points to this approach.   I would like to know who and/or where is QR defined and used as stand alone, because I have not seen this used.</p>",

However, in theory you could use an extension that just communicates the Q's identifier instead of canonical if that's all you have.  Without having <em>some</em> sort of identifier for the Q, you have no way of knowing that 3 different completed QRs are all for the same form, nor any hope of finding QRs for a given form.</p>",
