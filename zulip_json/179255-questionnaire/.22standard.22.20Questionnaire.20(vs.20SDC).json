I am having doubts about this behavior, and am wondering whether we can safely drop this non-SDC option to reduce confusion for the user.  In particular:</p>\n<p>1) Is there such a thing as a \"standard\" questionnaire, and does including extensions make it non-standard?<br>\n2) Are there scenarios in which an SDC Questionnaire loaded with its extensions would cause a problem that would be solved by our plain no-extension Questionnaire?</p>",
