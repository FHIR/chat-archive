If you would like a slice of that time, could you say so here?   (I can present the NLM tools, though as it worked out I already showed them to a few people earlier today.)  The idea is just to get a rough count (with the expectation that we might have some last minute additions) so we have an idea of how much time we'll each have to present.</p>",
