I recognize that the build site content is sometimes superseded by jira issues, so I am not sure what the really current thinking is about what the uri should be.</p>",

In  September of 2018 we had the URI I am using now.  (See <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/extension-questionnaire-observationlinkperiod.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/extension-questionnaire-observationlinkperiod.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/extension-questionnaire-observationlinkperiod.html</a>.)  I will update to the new one, and I guess I will need to support both the Sep. 2018 one and the current one to be kind to users.</p>",
