However, the tool does not support entry of more than one code per item. Additional codes need to be added by hand. Questionnaire has multiple items and corresponding answerOptions with codes.<br>\nI want to add SNOMED CT codes with specific editions (International, UK etc.). What would be the most efficient way of achieving this? Do I need to create Coding translations for each coded data type? Can it be done programmatically by leveraging APIs against a Terminology Server (SNOMED CT Expressions) or do I need to manually lookup the corresponding codes and enter them in the Coding Datatype?<br>\nAdditionally, if I am creating a Questionnaire from scratch (not from LOINC panels), how do I ensure the LOINC codes are valid and a match? Instead of manually looking up the codes can this be done programmatically as well.</p>",
