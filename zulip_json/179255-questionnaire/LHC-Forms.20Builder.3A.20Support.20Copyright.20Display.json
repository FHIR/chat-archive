        "content": "<p>It seems FHIR Questionnaire does not provide a mechanism for marking item-level text as copyright information for that item.  Current options would be (in FHIR) to create an item of type \"display\" that contains the copyright information (which would always show on the form), or to put it in help text for the item (which in LHC-Forms would mean the user would click the help button (\"?\") rather than the copyright button to see the text).   If you would like a FHIR Questionnaire that can have item-level copyright buttons showing the copyright text, then the thing to do would be to file a ticket at <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/\">https://jira.hl7.org/</a> so we can get that added as an extension.  In the interim, LHC-Forms could support a custom extension for that, though only LHC-Forms would understand it.   But, the first question is, do either of the existing options mentioned above (\"display\" or \"help\" text) fully meet your needs?</p>\n<p>(A separate issue which I will make a note of is that the NLM Form Builder should not be providing a way to enter copyright information that gets dropped from the FHIR output.)</p>",
