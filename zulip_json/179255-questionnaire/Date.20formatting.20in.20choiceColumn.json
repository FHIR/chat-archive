But <code>Condition.recordedDate</code> is instant type - '2021-10-10T10:00:00Z' which isn't human-readable. FHIRPath does not provide any date time formatting utils, only arithmetic. </p>\n<p>Any suggestions on how it can be converted into a local timezone and formatted as, for example, 10 October 2021, 14:00?</p>",
