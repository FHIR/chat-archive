Finding the question within the Questionnaire is something you'll need to write code for.  (Also, having Questionnaire contained within QuestionnaireResponse is saying \"This Questionnaire can only be linked to by this response and doesn't have enough information to stand alone and separate from the response\" - which is a weird thing to say about a Questionnaire.  Remember that containment isn't a handy-dandy way to avoid publishing two resources - it's for when the resoruces truly can't exist or be used separately.)</p>",
