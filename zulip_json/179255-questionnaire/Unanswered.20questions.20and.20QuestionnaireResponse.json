Does anyone have a concern about that?   It was suggested on today's Questionnaire call that we might, for instance, want to say that QuestionnaireResponses in memory could have items without answers, but persisted ones can't.  My concern with that is then if you ran FHIRPath on the memory version and the persisted version, you might get different results.</p>",

As far as I know our implementation builds up all the items without answers and also persists those items which are without answers at the moment. Clarifying or stating it explicitly that these items should not be part of the QR is a thumbs up from me.</p>",
