The SDC implementation guide has approved a few change proposals that introduce the notion of 'modular' questionnaires, where a parent form can have extensions that reference child Questionnaires in specific places and you can then invoke a sort of 'compile' operation to generate the fully fleshed out Questionnaire.  I'd hoped to have those tracker items applied by now, but at this point it's now looking like a \"next week\" activity.</p>",
