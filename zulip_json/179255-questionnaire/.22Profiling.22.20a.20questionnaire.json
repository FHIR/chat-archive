The user-generated questionnaires would plug into an existing workflow within the app. It would be expected for users to add whatever additional questions they want, but we'd want to require a core set of questions that MUST exist in order for 1) application logic and 2) consistent, proper extraction into other fhir resources. </p>\n<p>What would be the best way to do this? Does a profile (with slicing) make sense here? </p>\n<p>I don't have much experience writing profiles, but the potential problem I'm worried about is that, due to the unique recursive structure of the questionnaire, the \"item\" that I'd want to make assertions about would be like 5+ levels deep in nested items. Can a profile be defined that can define a \"slice\" that asserts \"at some depth of nested items, there exists an item that has properties: ....\". Something like the fhirpath \"Questionnaire.repeat(item|answer).where(linkId = '&lt;TARGET_LINK_ID&gt;')\" could maybe be useful here?</p>",
