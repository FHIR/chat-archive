It is not completely obvious what these values mean in the context of a unit list.  Here is what I would guess:</p>\n<p>1) optionsOnly - the user must choose one of the units specified in the unitOption or unitValueSet extensions<br>\n2) optionOrType - the user can either pick one of the specified units, or select a coding from the coding system specified by questionnaire-unit-supplemental-system (another new extension, also in <a href=\"http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-30581\">J#30581</a>)<br>\n3) optionOrString - the user can pick either one of the specified options, or a free-text string.</p>",

But, I think in this case it is constrained to be from the questionnaire-unit-supplemental-system.</p>",
