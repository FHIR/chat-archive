Especially, if I have multiple follow-on questions, I'd rather not have them repeat over and over.)</p>",

You'd need a variable on the common parent of the co-morbidity question and the follow-on question that would take on a boolean value based on whether one of the 'relevant' co-morbidities had been selected.
