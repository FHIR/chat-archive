I use SurveyJS in a SoF app that calculates a score based upon user input.  I think it depends what you mean by a long time.  For my application I use the asynchronous capability to hide latency that would otherwise freeze the app; from a user's perspective the calculation appears almost instantaneous.  For a more complex calculation you would want to implement something in the UI to let the user know a calculated result is pending.</p>",
