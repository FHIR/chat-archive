For example, if there is a Question \"last flu shot date\", you might want to remind the user to get a new one.  One way to do that would be to show an item of type=display with the message.  Some of our reminder rule messages we have (from a PHR system) contain embedded variables in them.  For example, it might say, \"Your last flu shot date was {fluShotDate}.  It is time to get another one.\"  So, to support that, we would want those messages to be FHIRPath expressions, but I think there isn't currently a way to set item.text with an expression. (Not even in <a href=\"http://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-25960\">J#25960</a>.)</p>",
