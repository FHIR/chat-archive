The extension provides a \"name\" and a \"type\".  The \"name\" I think I am free to choose and becomes the name of a variable accessible to FHIRPath in the Questionnaire. The \"type\" is supposed to be a ResourceType, and in the resolution to that tracker, I can now specify more than one type.  What exactly does it mean to request more than one type?  If I set \"name\" to \"artichoke\", and \"type\" to [\"Patient\", \"Practitioner\", \"Location\"], which resource will be placed into %artichoke?  All of them?</p>",
