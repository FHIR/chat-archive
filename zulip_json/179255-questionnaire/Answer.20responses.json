However, if you have exactly the same options for multiple questions, you'd typically want to use the same codes.  E.g. if the options for questions 1-5 were \"Agree\" and \"Disagree\", you'd generally use the same codes for each question.  You could, however, define distinct codes if you wanted to marry the semantic of the question and the answer.  For example, you could have a code 123 with a definition of \"Agree that chocolate is better than vanilla\" and a display of just \"Agree\" in the context of your form.</p>",
