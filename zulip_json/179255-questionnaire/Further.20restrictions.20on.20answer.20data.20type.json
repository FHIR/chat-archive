As far as I can tell, the only thing that can be directly restricted is the length (<code>maxLength</code>), otherwise one has to use extensions like the regex one. I was wondering to what extent the validator actively enforces such further constraints. E.g. are extensions \"actively\" supported, in the sense that it will e.g. evaluate the regex and cause an error if it does not match the entry in a <code>QuestionnaireResponse</code>?</p>",
