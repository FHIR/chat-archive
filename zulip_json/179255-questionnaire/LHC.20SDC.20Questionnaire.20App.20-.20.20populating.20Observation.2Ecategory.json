        "content": "<p>It says the category could be inferred from the code values (or \"known context\").  I am not sure how to do that for a general-purpose system, where the code and categories might anything.  It would be possible to support your example of including a code from the observation-category list, but I don't recall seeing that approach in the spec.  I think it is a good direction, if the category is important.  But, there is a problem -- the binding of observation-category to Observation.category is only \"preferred\", so the category code could be any value, and in particular it might not be in the coding system <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category\">http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category</a>, in which case I don't know how you would indicate it as a category code.</p>",
