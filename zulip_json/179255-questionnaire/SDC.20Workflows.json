Human/animal actors are always one of Patient, RelatedPerson or Practitioner.)</li>\n<li>The link from Task to Questionnaire is going to be 1..1.  If you want multiple Questionnaires to be completed, you'll need multiple Tasks.  (Because completion of each response will be tracked independently.  One could be completed while another is refused.)</li>\n<li>RequestGroup means that the individual ServiceRequests can't have an independent status.  I.e. they can't be cancelled, put on hold or marked as complete except as a group - that seems unusual?</li>\n<li>The use of ServiceRequest is optional.  You can ask people to fill out forms without there being a formal authorization (i.e. a ServiceRequest).  It's fine to support it, but be sure you need it before making it mandatory</li>\n<li>You might want to point to ActivityDefinitions rather than PlanDefinition so that you can refer to the specific aspects of the PlanDefinition that refer to the step for that particular form.

It's really a question of how much work do you expect the requesting system to do, vs. how much do you expect the filling system to do.  For simple clients, just giving them the simple Tasks of \"Fill out form 1\", \"Fill out form 2\", etc. is going to work better than \"Please instantiate protocol 123\" and having them figure out that means generating sub-tasks to fill out each form.  However, if your clients are sophisticated enough to manage the process, then yes, the layout you've described is viable.</p>",

Client will be interfacing with a Personal Health Device or access other resources at its disposal to gather the Vitals, Pulse etc. Now if one of the measurements generates a trigger (i.e. pulse is more than 100) then a specific questionnaire will be rendered and filled. The rest of the workflow should be similar. Where will the trigger conditions of the workflow defined? I see trigger and condition elements under action, is that where this is defined?
