I'm looking specifically at <em>formats for storing</em>, not tools for creating, rendering, or transmitting questionnaires. I'm aware of SurveyJS which has a JSON format (and for which there is even <a href=\"https://github.com/asbi-cds-tools/questionnaire-to-survey\">a converter lib</a>), but apart from some academic work, a quick search hasn't turned up that much else. Do any of you have experience with other alternatives, maybe even with conversion?</p>",
