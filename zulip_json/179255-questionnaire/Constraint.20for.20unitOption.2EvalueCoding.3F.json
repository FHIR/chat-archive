We need to be pretty cautious when we define capabilities to not nail them down so much that implementers can't do what they need to do.  In the SDC IG we impose additional constraints in the interest of maximizing interoperability, but that's not something we should rush to do outside the IG (e.g. when defining extensions).</p>",
