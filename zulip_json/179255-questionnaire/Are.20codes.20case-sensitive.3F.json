Interestingly, it seems to encourage code-<strong>in</strong>sensitive for my particular use-case, unless otherwise specified: <strong>CodeSystem.caseSensitive:</strong> <em>If this value is missing, then it is not specified whether a code system is case sensitive or not. When the rule is not known, Postel's law should be followed: produce codes with the correct case, and accept codes in any case.</em></p>\n<p>In that sense the \"broken\" Bluebook response example might even serve as a test case for that subtlety.</p>",
