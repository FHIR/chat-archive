He mentioned reference libraries that would implement these functionalities, but i cannot find any. I can see that the lforms project is moving in this direction. Are there any other? Also, the active questionnaire functionalities are part of the Structured Data Capture (SDC) Implementation Guide. Are there any implementations of that yet?</p>",

I don't think it's supported anywhere else yet.  And yes, it's defined by SDC.
