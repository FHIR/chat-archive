From reading past threads it seems the way to do this is to treat it as a normal question and put the score in QR.item.answer.value, but then my question is how to indicate that this response is a generated score and not a patient entered response? I saw a past answer by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  mentioning marking it as a \"read-only\" field but I don't know how to do this, would that involve using an extension?</p>",
