For string fields, we repeat those by adding additional rows in the form, so visually each value is in a separate field, and we could allow the user to edit one and still calculate another.  Other on the other hand, for list fields, the display text of the selected items is put into \"selected items\" area, so that seems more like a single (multi-part) value, and it would be confusing to the user to calculate only some of those values.  I think our code will be more understandable with just taking a single approach, so I plan to stop applying calculatedExpression to the whole group of of values when one is edited,  regardless of the UI.</p>",
