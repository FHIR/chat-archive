With the relationship the link can be forward or backward looking (or at the same time).  Some activities run continuously (eg collection of CM/AE) - the windowing can be done with offsetRange - but you lose the target day (ie Visit 2 happens 21 days after visit 1 +/- 2 days) - that might be a candidate for an extension as the +/- can be asymmetric about the target day</p>",
