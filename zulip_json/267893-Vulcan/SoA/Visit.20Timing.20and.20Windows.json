        "content": "<p>Hello!<br>\nIn just about clinical trial SoA, visits exist that have what I'll call \"relative timing\" as well as visit windows. Typically, the timing of a visit is relative to \"Day 1\" (usually a Baseline visit). For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Baseline visit<br>\n-- Timing: Day 1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Visit 2:<br>\n-- Timing: Day 10<br>\n-- Visit Window: +/- 1 day</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Visit 3:<br>\n--Timing: Day 30<br>\n-- Visit Window: +/- 2 days</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These relative timings have to be abstracted (as opposed to being represented as a date) because each subject in a clinical trial will start at different points in time (e.g., Subject 1 starts on May 1st; Subject 2 starts on August 5th).</p>\n<p>Question: Has anybody figured out how to store this info in PlanDefinition? The needs on the app we're working on are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Need to store which visit (PlanDefinition.Action) is the \"anchor\" visit (the one against which the others are timed)</li>\n<li>Need to store the relative timing value and units</li>\n<li>Need to store the visit window value and units.</li>\n</ul>",
