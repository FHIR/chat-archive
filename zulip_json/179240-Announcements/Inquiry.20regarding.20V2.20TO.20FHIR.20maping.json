If anyone (in the industry or academia) is working or know about any v2 to FHIR mapping framework(model), then please share information with me. I want to just confirm it that should such type model is available or not.</p>\n<p>I understand that some people are working in this area, but I assume that there is no middle ware engine available and people are working to map specific resources from their own develop framework not through common framework. Am I right? Please advise me in this regard.</p>\n<p>I would be so thankful, if he or she can share information with me through my email ( [mohd.ayazkn@gmail.com]<br>\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Ayaz, PhD Student<br>\nEmail: [mohd.ayazkn@gmail.com]</p>",
