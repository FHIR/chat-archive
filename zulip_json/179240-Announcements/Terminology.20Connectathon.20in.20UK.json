This includes feedback on the planned functionality as well as understanding the priority functionality that implementers and users require.</li>\n<li>develop a community of interest to enable participation in the future development of the service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You are able to attend either day one or both days – full details on how to register, what to expect and preparation guidance are all detailed on the registration page. Find out more and register your interest in attending here</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to limit the number of delegates from each organisation (owing to venue capacity constraints).
