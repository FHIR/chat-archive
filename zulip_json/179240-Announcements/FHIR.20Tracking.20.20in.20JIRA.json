        "content": "<p>The use of gForge for FHIR tracker items has now come to a close.  The very first tracker item was raised on January 19, 2014.  In the almost 6 years since then, the community has submitted 18,534 requests for change - either as part of ballot (8440) or as unsolicited change requests (over 10,000).</p>\n<p>All of these tracker items - and their associated balloting information - have now been successfully migrated to gForge.  Redirects in the FHIR specifications should now direct users to gForge rather than Jira.</p>\n<p>All issue identifiers have been retained, though they are now prefixed with 'FHIR-\".  For example, our very first issue, which was located at <a href=\"https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=2839\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=2839\">https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=2839</a> is now located at <a href=\"http://jira.hl7.org/browse/fhir-2839\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://jira.hl7.org/browse/fhir-2839\">http://jira.hl7.org/browse/fhir-2839</a>.  (See how much better Jira is? :&gt;)</p>\n<p>Redirects in the core spec and in <a href=\"http://chat.fhir.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://chat.fhir.org\">chat.fhir.org</a> have already been changed to the new platform, though IGs that were published using older templates may still end up directing to gForge.  </p>\n<p>As has previously been mentioned, there are a set of starter videos on Confluence (<a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HDH/JIRA+Tracking\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HDH/JIRA+Tracking\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HDH/JIRA+Tracking</a>).  As well there's detailed documentation on the use of the feedback trackers here: <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Specification+Feedback\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Specification+Feedback\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Specification+Feedback</a></p>\n<p>If you run into any questions/issues, you can raise them on the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"184932\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/184932-JIRA.2FConfluence\">#JIRA/Confluence</a>  stream.  (If you're not on <a href=\"http://chat.fhir.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://chat.fhir.org\">chat.fhir.org</a> yet, consider this your excuse for signing up, though if need be, you can also send me an email.</p>\n<p>Note that the balloting function is not fully functional yet.  For now, focus on using Jira just to submit and manage tracker items.  Adding additional projects to support CDA, V2 and other product families is on the agenda for the new year.</p>",
