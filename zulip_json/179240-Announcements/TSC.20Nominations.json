Below are some detailed time/travel expectations:<br>\n•   Weekly 1  to 1.5 hour TSC meetings<br>\n•   Expectation to participate in at least one TSC subcommittee or task force, meeting 1 hour per week on average<br>\n•   Participate in the weekly TSC e-vote. The time spent on this varies, depending on the volume of items in e-vote, but probably less than an hour<br>\n•   At this point, the TSC holds a 4-hour virtual meeting prior to the WGM. These were day long face to face meetings in the past, it’s not clear yet if we will go back to face to face prior to the WGM, or leave it virtual<br>\n•   TSC Retreat, usually in conjunction with the Summer Board Retreat. This was virtual last year, and this year, but next year it will likely involve travel.<br>\nThe TSC Chair-Elect will have additional time requirements particularly during the period spent as TSC Chair that are sometimes difficult to quantify. </p>\n<p>The Working Group, Implementer and Affiliate representative positions are all subject to a limit of 2 consecutive terms, and the current TSC members holding those positions are eligible to run for one additional term. Details on the above positions can be found in the HL7 Governance and Operations Manual section 8.02 (Annual Nomination and Election of HL7 Leadership by Administrative Ballot) and section 10 (Technical Steering Committee). <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/HL7_Governance_and_Operations_Manual.pdf\">http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/membership/HL7_Governance_and_Operations_Manual.pdf</a></p>\n<p>If you have any questions about any of the above positions, particularly in regards to the TSC Chair-Elect, feel free to contact me at <a href=\"mailto:austin.j.kreisler@leidos.com\">austin.j.kreisler@leidos.com</a>.
