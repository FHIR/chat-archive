This IG implements RFC 2324 to give full morning pleasure to FHIR users and implementers alike. And, thanks to @John Moehrke it has full auditing so no worries about unauthorized coffee drinking will slip by. This desperately needed FHIR IG can be found at <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/DavidPyke/HotBeverage/\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/DavidPyke/HotBeverage/</a> The team will be looking to move it to HL7 and normative status as soon as we get a good cup of espresso</p>",
