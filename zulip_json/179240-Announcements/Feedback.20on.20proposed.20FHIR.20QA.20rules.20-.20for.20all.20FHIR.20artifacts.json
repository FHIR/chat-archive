These criteria will form the basis for achieving FMM 3 and higher.  They'll apply to all HL7 artifacts as well as artifacts produced by other organizations who choose to adhere to HL7's FMM framework.</p>\n<p>The proposed criteria can be found here: <a href=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Conformance_QA_Criteria\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Conformance_QA_Criteria\">http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Conformance_QA_Criteria</a></p>\n<p>We're interested in feedback from two groups: Implementers and HL7 committers &amp; content creators</p>\n<p>We're interested in all feedback, but we're particularly interested in the following:<br>\n- Are these criteria complete?  Are there others we need?<br>\n- Are these criteria useful?  Are there any of these we shouldn't be wasting our time on?<br>\n- Are these criteria reasonable?  If you're going to be creating your own IGs and associated resources, would you be comfortable adhering to these criteria?</p>\n<p>The FMG is asking that all feedback be provided by July 12.  Feedback may be submitted by emailing <a href=\"mailto:fmgcontact@hl7.org\" title=\"mailto:fmgcontact@hl7.org\">fmgcontact@hl7.org</a></p>\n<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact me or any other member of the FHIR management group.</p>",
