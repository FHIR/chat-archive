This QA is purely grammatical and spelling - it's not about content. What we do is to download the spec, convert the pages to a number of  MSWord documents which volunteers then spell check. These are returned to the editors for updating the spec. Takes about half an hour (if we have enough people!)</p>\n<p>If you're interested in helping out (and the warm fuzzy feeling that you get from doing that - regrettably we can't offer fame and fortune) then send me an email at <a href=\"mailto:david.hay25@gmail.com\" title=\"mailto:david.hay25@gmail.com\">david.hay25@gmail.com</a>. The QA period begins 11th November and ends 25th November. Volunteers will be recognized in the chat though...</p>\n<p>Your help is much appreciated!</p>",
