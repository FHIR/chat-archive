Our company <a href=\"http://mayjuun.com\">MayJuun</a> will be co-hosting a <a href=\"https://fhirathack.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&amp;ref_medium=discover\">Healthcare Hackathon July 9-11</a> along with <a href=\"https://atsign.com/\">The @ Company</a>. We're encouraging, but not requiring, the use of Dart/Flutter (and of course FHIR). We have a lot of devs signed up, but could use some more content experts. So if you (or anyone you know) would be interested in either participating directly or as an advisor to some of the groups, please let me know!</p>",
