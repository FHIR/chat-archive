The problem appears to be in the Apache server, and the server it is running run gives us no access to restart Apache (presumably it's shared...). I've been unable to get any support on the server, so <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"193461\">@David Johnson</span>  (HL7 webmaster) and I are currently moving it off the shared host to a dedicated server that we manage completely. Hopefully we'll get this done today</p>",
