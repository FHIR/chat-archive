That stream aims to facilitate the growth of a global IPS (International Patient Summary) community of practice by sharing, exploring, and developing ideas around the IPS.<br>\nIn this sense it should be open to any discussion and idea about <br>\n  (1) the IPS ecosystems, including the IPS CDA implementers, the CEN EN 17269 standard (the reference IPS dataset), or the future ISO IPS standard and IHE IPS profile; <br>\n (2) the IPS implementations <br>\n (3) correlation of the IPS with other initiatives (e.g. argonaut).</p>\n<p>Iâ€™d like then to invite all the interested people to join the stream and contribute to the IPS community.</p>\n<p>Thanks, Giorgio</p>",
