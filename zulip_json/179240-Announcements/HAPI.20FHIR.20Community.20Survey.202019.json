The survey is a not-quite-annual tradition that helps us to set priority for the coming year and get a pulse on how people are using HAPI FHIR.</p>\n<p>We would very much appreciate if everyone could take a few minutes to fill it out. The survey is short (2 pages / 5 mins) so it shouldn't be much of a burden.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/33HO4cs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://bit.ly/33HO4cs\">http://bit.ly/33HO4cs</a></p>\n<p>Please also feel free to circulate this link to help spread the word!</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nJames</p>",
