The amount of work to be done to get R4B to be ready to publish seems unlikely to happen by Jan. 14th, which is the latest publication can reasonably happen as part of the January ballot cycle.  Therefore, the FMG will be seeking TSC approval to put R4B out on the earliest possible date as part of the May cycle.  Presuming approval is granted, R4B should open about Feb. 18 (with sign-up beginning Jan. 19th).  Our apologies for this delay.  Unfortunately, the volume of development and maintenance work on the IG Publisher and terminology systems turned out to be significantly higher than anticipated.  Work groups participating in R4B should have their content ready for migration and subsequent QA testing around the end of January.</p>",
