We're running 3 of the tracks from the Montreal connectathon: Patient (entry level stream), Structured Data Capture (questionnaire stuff) and SMART on FHIR  - CA (using SMART with Canadian profiles).  If you want to do something else, there's an experimental track too.  In addition to hacking, there will also be tutorials and networking opportunities.
