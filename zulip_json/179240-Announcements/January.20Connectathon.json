If you send an email during this window Office 365 will queue the message and send it when the system comes back online.  Your mail message WILL GO OUT after we bring the system back online, so no mail message will be lost if you send during the maintenance window.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding.<br>\nEric Schmitt   <a href=\"mailto:Webmaster@hl7.org\">Webmaster@hl7.org</a></p>",
