I googled a bit but most of them only support bundle transaction, but not bundle.type = message.  Any URl is appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",

If you want the message actually *processed* using the $process-message endpoint, that's harder - because the responses to every single message can be different - they'd have to be coded separately.  Generic servers can't reasonably be expected to do that.</p>",
