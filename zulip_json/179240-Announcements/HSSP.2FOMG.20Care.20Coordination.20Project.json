If you're interested, let me or Anuj (cc:ed to this email) know, and then we'll determine where project discussions should happen (<a href=\"http://chat.fhir.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://chat.fhir.org\">chat.fhir.org</a>? FHIR email list? HSSP email list? a specific email list? FHIR workflow call? HSSP calls? comments welcome)</p>",
