This summer, we upgraded to FHIR R4 and brought it to Connectathon in Atlanta. Per our announcement today at the HLTH conference in Las Vegas, the server has been open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license and is available here: <a href=\"https://github.com/ibm/fhir\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ibm/fhir\">https://github.com/ibm/fhir</a>.</p>\n<p>It's been a privilege to watch the growth of FHIR over the past several years and we're looking forward to being a more visible part of the community. We've created a new stream at <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"212434\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/212434-ibm\">#ibm</a> for discussions that are specific to this project, so come say hi if you want to chat.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>The IBM FHIR team</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192334\">@John Timm</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192632\">@Paul Bastide</span>,  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"246296\">@Albert(Xu) Wang</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"223992\">@Senthil Bakthavachalam</span>, and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191676\">@Lee Surprenant</span></p>",
