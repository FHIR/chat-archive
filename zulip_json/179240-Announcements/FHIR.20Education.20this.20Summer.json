This year we have been offering several new online classes and trying out different pricing schemes. I thought you might be interested in a subscription pricing series that is being offered for FHIR online classes. Student discounts are also available. The subscription price is a nice discount for 5 online classes. These webinars are being recorded and you will have free access to the recordings for 6 months once you are registered. Access to the recordings is a helpful feature if you are concerned that you may not be able to attend any class. You can register for this series here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/events/webinar/fhir/summer-school/2018/07/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hl7.org/events/webinar/fhir/summer-school/2018/07/\">http://www.hl7.org/events/webinar/fhir/summer-school/2018/07/</a></p>\n<p>Please forward this information to anyone who you think may be interested.</p>\n<p>The FHIR Proficiency Certification exam is very new – you may also have an interest in getting certified.  There is a review course, a study guide, and a practice test available to help prepare and again a student discount is available on the test itself.  The test does not require any hands-on demonstration of ability.  The student is tested on core knowledge of the STU3 standard.  You will find the information on the test and study guide here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/implement/certification.cfm?ref=nav\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hl7.org/implement/certification.cfm?ref=nav\">http://www.hl7.org/implement/certification.cfm?ref=nav</a></p>\n<p>If you pass the certificate exam you can get a digital badge that you can list on your business signature, LinkedIn profile etc.</p>\n<p>The  FHIR Fundamental's program is also being offered.  It spans a full month and blends hands-on learning with didactic  material: <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/events/fhir_fun.cfm?ref=nav\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hl7.org/events/fhir_fun.cfm?ref=nav\">http://www.hl7.org/events/fhir_fun.cfm?ref=nav</a></p>\n<p>You may also be interested in recommending others for training.
