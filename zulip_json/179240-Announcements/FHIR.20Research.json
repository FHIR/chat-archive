I am a PhD Student currently working on clinical data modelling and distributed machine learning with FHIR @ Maastricht University/ Maastro Clinic, Netherlands.</p>\n<p>I am going for a short trip to the USA during the first 2 weeks of the New Year (Jan 2nd'19 until Jan 12th '19 ). Presently, I am looking for some opportunities to get in touch with some research groups in the USA working on clinical data modelling/ data science in FHIR.  I would be very interested in spending a couple of days to a week learning about their work and sharing what we are doing here at Maastricht University. </p>\n<p>Recently, at the Netherlands HL7 WGM, we demonstrated the PoC of our idea. You can follow it on github : <a href=\"https://github.com/jvsoest/PHT_on_FHIR_demo\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jvsoest/PHT_on_FHIR_demo\">https://github.com/jvsoest/PHT_on_FHIR_demo</a></p>\n<p>Any leads from any of you will be very much appreciated.  Looking forward to hearing from you :).</p>",
