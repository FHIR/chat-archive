If you have suggestions for contributions - preferably with particular projects in mind - please message me directly for inclusion in my blog. Projects need not be related to FHIR, but need to be related to health and IT/informatics</p>",

I am wondering whether a room is meant as an organization or as a location. On one image the information i have to map is shown and on the other one how i would do that. I don't have an idea how to handle the room. Does someone have some advice for me?</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/JblECUWiaAwdUeYMPxp5KuNy/ieee.JPG\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ieee.JPG\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/JblECUWiaAwdUeYMPxp5KuNy/ieee.JPG\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/vwiNSAcNAjMlM5labqY2b-9D/partof.JPG\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"partof.JPG\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/vwiNSAcNAjMlM5labqY2b-9D/partof.JPG\"></a></div>",
