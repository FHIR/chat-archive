        "content": "<p>Hi there - I'm using ClinFHIR's patient viewer connected to my hspc sandbox which contains several Condition, Encounter, and Observations for a given Patient.  When I look at the resource references graph viewer, it only seems to show the resources with a <code>subject</code> relationship.  Seems that my Immunization instance doesn't show. That differs from the others because it has a <code>patient</code> attribute with a reference(Patient) instead of the <code>subject</code> attribute with Reference(Patient).  Is this expected or should I be seeing immunizations in the graph viewer? cc: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192054\">@Viet Nguyen</span></p>",
