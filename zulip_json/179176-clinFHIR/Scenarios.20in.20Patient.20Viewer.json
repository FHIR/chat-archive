Selecting one will display that patient. </p>\n<p>Anyone can create scenarios - either manually or using graph builder - I'll write up the process, and link to it from here. </p>\n<p>One thing it has shown is that large scenarios (like the <a href=\"https://github.com/chronic-care/sample-data\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/chronic-care/sample-data\">care plan ones</a> I brought over from gihub) do look a mess in the graph views. It gets a bit better if you select a resource, then go to the references tab on the right  - that only shows the directly connected resources which is a bit more manageable.
