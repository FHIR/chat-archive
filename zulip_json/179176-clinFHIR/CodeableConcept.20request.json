Right now it looks like I can either enter something that is looked up and expanded, or the text value if not coded. I'd like to be able to enter my own coding.

Do you know if there are any available?</p>\n<p>If not, then there are alternatives that we can use to 'mock it up' for the purposes of example. Basically what we do is to create a CodeSystem resource that has some of the concepts in it (CF does have such a builder), then create the profile referencing that CodeSystem (via a ValueSet).</p>\n<p>If you can either locate an existing ValueSet, or give me some sample data I'll have a go at it...  (I'll also need to know what  resource &amp; element you are modifying)</p>",
