In truth, calling a document a scenario is probably misleading - it would be more accurate to say that you're using the scenario builder as a document builder in this case...</p>\n<p>And the current Scenario builder is somewhat limited in representing the changes to resources &amp; their relationships that might occur over the course of a scenario.
