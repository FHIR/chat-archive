Rather FHIR takes care of and models some of the complexity as resource attributes etc and externalizes the rest to extensions/profiles. Is that a correct view?</p>\n<p>So if we want to create a shared clinical requirements-gathering community/space/tooling, then a more interesting thing to do is to figure out ways to keep the clinical reqirement discussions in one place and then form archetypes, FHIR-Resources and profiles from the same disciussions using somewhat integrated tools. If that is done while being aware of and talking to each other, then mappings+extensions will be somewhat easier, and maybe in some cases mappings/profiles could be created and released together. </p>\n<p>It might, or might not, be in the interst of Ocean Informatics (the company behind CKM-tool) to extend their tool to accomodate FHIR-artifact discussion/generation, I don't know, but I'd expect them to at least want to get paid for such extension work. I have long been arguing for moving the CKM-discussions to an open source environment to encourage extensions/modifications etc, but since openEHR gets the service free of charge this has naturally not been a priority for the openEHR Foundation since there are more urgent things to focus on.</p>\n<p>Since it is in the interest of many of us in both openEHR, HL7 and ISO 13606communities to strive for one clinical reqirements-gathering community rather than many, I think we can figure out ways to align some tooling no matter what, if there is a will from all sides.

In openEHR, the RM is fixed, noone gets a choice on that. But it's easy for local groups to invent their own blood pressure measurement archetype. It just happens that they don't, by choice - there's only one such archetype, at <a href=\"http://openEHR.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://openEHR.org\">openEHR.org</a>. They do invent competing versions of less obvious things though (e.g. medication order), and sometimes it takes time for those to bubble up from the national level to international level. It's messy, but commonality does emerge, and there are many archetypes to show that. How well this process works is completely to do with organisational agreements, communication, cooperation, and only slightly to do with tools and technical aspects.</p>\n<p>The same will be true in FHIR: it will be just as easy for 10 groups to create 10 profiles based on a core FHIR resource, each intended to model the same thing (say part of a pregnancy record), and they will come up with 10 different non-interoperable profiles. Since FHIR is more developer/IT oriented, it's also more likely that these models will reflect IT pre-occupations rather than clinical knowledge. See this post (<a href=\"http://wolandscat.net/2015/11/29/why-it-people-cant-build-information-systems/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wolandscat.net/2015/11/29/why-it-people-cant-build-information-systems/\">http://wolandscat.net/2015/11/29/why-it-people-cant-build-information-systems/</a>) for the reality of IT people  trying to design clinical artefacts. This problem in FHIR will probably be greater even than in openEHR, because now we are talking thousands of developer companies, not just a small number of clinical modelling programmes. This isn't a criticism - it's just how anything that is like 'profiling' ends up working in practice.</p>\n<p>openEHR, and other model-based architectures already have interoperability (including over REST), but we don't have it over FHIR. THere are customers who want a) semantic interoperability, b) clinical models that can be re-used in more places than just FHIR, c) but they want FHIR today (they've been told it solves everything...). It seems pretty clear how to achieve it, except that the obvious path is not currently open.</p>\n<p>BTW, most 'real clinical systems' only approximately represent what clinicians do. Most are terribly badly designed and the clinical semantics are buried in the UI forms, not the database. Most lack formal models of business level process or content, and the most common schemas are just huge ER models that try to capture every known data point on every major logical 'type' they can think of.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191388\">@Thomas Beale</span> The difference is the granularity of the base model.  The RM for OpenEHR is extremely abstract (sort of like the RIM, though with a different approach) with numerous ways of conveying the same thing.  The semantics live in the archetype definitions, not the RM.  In FHIR, the base model is semantic-rich and extremely concrete.  The base model for MedicationOrder in FHIR has specific slots for prescriber, patient, medication, various aspects of dosage instruction such as start date, dose quantity, maximum dose/period, etc.  So there's a significant degree of consistency enforced by the base model - the key semantics are defined in the base model and only more esoteric semantics (e.g. sophisticated components needed for chemotherapy protocols) are left to the profiling/archetypes level as extensions.  The result is that, while there may be disagreement over what code system to use for medications, there's still a standard way to convey that medication and that dosage.  If we bring in the OpenEHR models, then there becomes 11+ ways that same information might show up in an instance - and that's a problem.  Right now, I know how to find the dose quantity of any FHIR prescription written anywhere in the world (if they capture dose as a discrete value).  If we introduce the OpenEHR archetypes or other models, that won't be true anymore.</p>\n<p>There are certainly advantages to having OpenEHR leverage the FHIR infrastructure, but for it to not disrupt the existing FHIR community, we'd have to compartmentalize the use of the specification so it's clear what degree of interoperability implementers can expect with a given system.  Right now, we're working to convey the advantages of having OpenEHR at least partially within the tent and also how to properly delineate implementations.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> the models are of course different. FHIR clinical resources are designed as a single level model to which adjustments can be made; the opeEHR reference model is a model of generic structure plus context attributes (only the varying clinical semantics have to be added). One could think of the FHIR resource Condition for example as being similar to the compiled version of the openEHR Problem archetype, where compilation causes inheritance flattening of any lineage of archetypes onto the RM. Similarly, Fhir:MedicationOrder has similar attributes to be openEHR RM - Instruction (contains the generic attributes of orders) coupled with archetypes of various kinds of order, including Medication Order.</p>\n<p>It appears that the resulting deployable models in each case somehow suit the various communities who create them.  But the result in openEHR isn't 11 ways to describe Medication Order, there is just one (<a href=\"http://www.openehr.org/ckm/#showArchetype_1013.1.123_mindmap\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.openehr.org/ckm/#showArchetype_1013.1.123_mindmap\">http://www.openehr.org/ckm/#showArchetype_1013.1.123_mindmap</a>), but if national programmes want something different, they can define it. It's not up to a standards organisation to prevent that. </p>\n<p>It's only a problem if the actual data sharers discover it is, e.g. across European borders. Then they become very interested in using the same model, and indeed that's what happens over time. This level of standardisation is driven by real-world mutual interest. Does it matter if the Australian Medcation order model is different from the international one? Not really. If it starts mattering, then relevant agencies will no doubt act.</p>\n<p>So it's not really true to say that the technical possibility of there being more than one archetype for Medication Order poses a problem to FHIR. There will only be multiple versions of such a model when cross-border interoperability doesn't matter and no efforts are made to standardise. On the other hand, a great majority of detailed clinical data never go beyond their original systems - what is widely shared is in fact only about 5-10% of the total data in an EMR - i.e. the managed lists (Rx, Dx, allergies etc), basic demographics, family history, etc. So there's actually no sense in imposing a standard 'pregnancy record' model on the whole world when such a thing doesn't exist in reality; each country has its own and that's the way they want it.</p>\n<p>I'm not bringing any of this up to be difficult (despite possible opinions to the contrary) - what I'm pointing out is that neither FHIR, nor openEHR, nor any other clinical standards like effort can impose the one model to rule them all on the world; it can only create tools and formalisms that provide capabilities. The rest is up to human institutional agreements.</p>\n<p>I think the benefits of model-driven clinical data standards are pretty clear: single-source modelling, with multiple downstream deployments. At the moment, we can't easily connect that kind of framework to FHIR, but I am arguing that it would be a good idea. How else could 20,000 - 50,000 clinical content (and soon - workflow) data point models (= ~4,000 openEHR style archetypes) be deployed over FHIR? It's not going to happen by old-style custom mapping approach.</p>\n<p>Obviously it would need to be done as a serious conversation between organisations (openEHR is just one of many),  so that the various levels of tooling and models were properly managed and described, enabling developers. If we did this, the benefits could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>directly connecting large numbers of clinical model authors to the FHIR framework</li>\n<li>enabling a path for CIMI models to be natively deployed over FHIR</li>\n<li>enabling re-use of content models used in FHIR in other downstream technologies</li>\n<li>standardising the approach to using terminology from content models to the FHIR approach</li>\n<li>making FHIR 'profiling' and the archetype formalism (which appear to do the same thing) into one formalism</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of this is aimed at reducing wheel invention and obtaining significant added value by connected currently disconnected large pieces of work in health informatics together.</p>",
