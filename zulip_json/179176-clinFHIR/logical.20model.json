I did a video here (<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/200105501\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://vimeo.com/200105501\">https://vimeo.com/200105501</a> ) but basically you build a logical model based on the core resource, and then add properties for the extra stuff you want (which will be extensions in real life of course). You can then build instances based on those models. They aren't real FHIR profiles of course, and won't validate or be saved on a FHIR server, but it might be enough for you to continue with design work... (They will be saved in a scenario as these are saved locally in the browser, or as an attachment when saved in the Library...</p>",
