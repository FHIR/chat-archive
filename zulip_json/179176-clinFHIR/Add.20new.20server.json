It passes the checks for 'Support $everything' and 'Is terminology server'. But when I try to add a Patient to the Scenario Builder, I'm getting <code>{\"msg\":\"No matching profile (http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient) found on http://fhirtest.b12x.org/baseDstu3/StructureDefinition (but not a server error - just not present)\"}</code> message. It works when I point to the public HAPI STU3 server. Any advice appreciated.</p>",
