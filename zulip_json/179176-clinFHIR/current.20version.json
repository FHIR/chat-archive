The requirement is that clinFHIR can retrieve conformance resources representing the current build so the committees can use them as a basis for building examples and visualizing whether changes to the core spec make sense (kind of like logical models, but using profiles).<br>\nI appreciate that you can load them to your server and retrieve them in the usual way, but this doesn't feel like a solution that would scale - unless it could be automated. Would it be feasible to retrieve them directly from github using 'ordinary' GET? (Though it would not then be possible to save the examples other than as downloaded instances of course)</p>",
