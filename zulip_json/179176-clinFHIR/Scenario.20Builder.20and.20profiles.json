When I do, I get errors on extensions like this:</p>\n<p>makeProfileDisplayFromProfile: Error retrieving <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DiagnosticReport-geneticsAnalysis\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DiagnosticReport-geneticsAnalysis\">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DiagnosticReport-geneticsAnalysis</a> {\"msg\":\"No matching profile (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DiagnosticReport-geneticsAnalysis\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DiagnosticReport-geneticsAnalysis\">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DiagnosticReport-geneticsAnalysis</a>) found on <a href=\"http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu3/StructureDefinition\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu3/StructureDefinition\">http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu3/StructureDefinition</a> (but not a server error - just not present)\"}</p>\n<p>I tried some other STU3 servers, and I get some different behaviors, but none work as I would expect.  Does this mean there is a problem in the definition of this profile?  Or is this something the Scenario Builder doesn't handle?  It did seem to work with a couple of other profiles I tried.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>",
