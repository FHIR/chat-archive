In that case the 'child elements' are actually part of the race extension (Which is a complex extension - ie a single extension that 'contains' the child extensions. Provided that there is a conformance server that has that extension loaded (and right now  we're right in the middle of finalising STU3 so the environment is a bit confused) then you should be able create a profile on patient which has the race extension in it, and view that in clinfhir.
