        "content": "<p>Hi Lisa -  couple of things.</p>\n<p>The cause of this error is that the StructureDefinition file for List (that defines the resource type) has been removed from the hapi4 server. I'm not exactly sure how - even the history of it is gone. If you change the conformance server to 'nzProjectR4' then it ought to work. (This is a HAPI server that I've set up)</p>\n<p>This is by no means the first time that something like that has happened. Because the Scenario Builder gets the SD files from public servers, it's dependent on them, which is rather annoying! Because of this - and also the need to support profiles/IGs like USCore , I'm in the process of a complete re-write that doesn't have this dependency </p>\n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"http://gb2.clinfhir.com/\">http://gb2.clinfhir.com/</a>.   It's still not complete - in particular FHIR instances are not saved to a server. The focus is more on 'graphs' of resources connected together to tell the clinical story - but it does support adding structured data to the instances using FSH &amp; sushi to create the resource instances (thanks to the kind folk at mitre).  </p>\n<p>This does mean that users need to understand a subset of FSH to add structured data , but that's not too hard - and I'm working on a guide for this (<a href=\"http://gb2.clinfhir.com/mkdocs/site/FSH/\">http://gb2.clinfhir.com/mkdocs/site/FSH/</a> )</p>\n<p>This approach will allow the tool to better support profiled FHIR, which has been a weak point in the past.</p>\n<p>If you click the question mark at the upper right you'll get some help - check out the quick start in particular - but note that the help is definitely also a WIP !</p>\n<p>Interested in any feedback you may have!</p>",
