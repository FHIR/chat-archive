A profile <em>does</em> conform to a core resource type - with extensions for additional elements. The plan is that CF will generate a profile based on a logical model (you use the mapping to indicate the extensions). Currently this is still a work in progress - when a bit more stable I'll blog about it. The idea of the logical model is to make it easier to represent clinical requirements in an analysis phase without getting too bogged down in the conformance artifacts required to do this properly.</p>\n<p>Of course, the purpose of all of this is educational and for v simple profiles - forge remains the 'goto' tool for anything serious...</p>",

They'll likely be OK for simple ones once I get the bugs out (so little time !) so do use forge for 'real' ones at the moment.</p>\n<p>I suspect that your error is a CORS one that we've noted with Chrome when the servers get changed. You can confirm that if you display the javascript console in chrome - unfortunately I haven't figured out how to trap those errors with a better user message. In our testing it gets fixed if you clear the browser cache (or use a different browser!)</p>\n<p>Let me know how you get on...</p>",
