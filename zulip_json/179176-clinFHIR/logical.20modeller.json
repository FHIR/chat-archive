        "content": "<p>Hi Jayashree - the modeller can be used in a number of ways, and the answer about the element mapping depends on what you're wanting to achieve. I assume that you are wanting to build a simple profile based on Patient and started with a 'single resource' (Patient) when you created the model. </p>\n<p>When you add an 'occupation' element to the logical model and subsequently generate a profile, it will be represented in the profile as an extension, so what you need to do is first create the extension definition and bind it to the ValueSet (there’s a module in CF that does that), then set the fhir mapping in the model element to 'Patient.extension' and a button will be displayed that allows you to select that extension.</p>\n<p>When you subsequently generate the profile (select the Model tab at the top right, then click the ‘Generate Profile’ link bottom right) the profile will be correctly ‘wired up’ to the extension definition.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t interest in generating profiles, and just want to represent a model – say as part of a design process – then you can just ignore the mapping. In that case you’d bind the element to the ValueSet (as you did) so that it would show correctly when using the Logical Model in the Scenario Builder (see <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/200105501\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://vimeo.com/200105501\">https://vimeo.com/200105501</a> )</p>",
