If you select a profile (including a base resource profile) then click on the 'eye' icon to the left of the name,  there is a new tab - currently labelled 'Element Graph'. This shows a graphical representation of the profile. Idea is to make it easier for people to 'visualize' what the profile looks like. I have a few ideas for improvement that I'll work on over the next little while, but  comments welcome...</p>",
