This will mean it starts enforcing regexes it hasn't before. In addition, I have updated the validator to produce an error if the regex is in the wrong place (I had suppressed that before).</p>\n<p>But i won't be changing the released packages (e.g. hl7.fhir.r4.core), so it will continue to be in the wrong place in them.</p>",
