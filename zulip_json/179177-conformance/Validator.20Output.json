In generally, the validator is going to accumulate a lot of errors if it is testing profiles, since errors mean this resource isn't one of the ones that conform to this profile. Which could be 10000s of errors in a bundle, all of which are perfectly expected and of no interest to anyone. I don't think the validator knows how to know whether they are of interest or not</p>",
