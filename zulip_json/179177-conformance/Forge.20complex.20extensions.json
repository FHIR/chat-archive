Select at least one type.<br>\nMyExtension / expressedDate / Type(s)   This element has no type.  Select at least one type.</p>\n<p>The consentGiven and expressedDate elements do not have a type selector pane (as the type selector is against the child valueBoolean / valueDateTime elements).</p>\n<p>Do you know if there is something I am doing wrong?</p>\n<p>Many thanks.</p>",
