At the moment, the standard Java validator complains that these are not valid codes. I tried adding them as a CodeSystem supplement for LOINC and load that via the <code>-ig</code> parameter, but that did not work. Is there a way to avoid errors being generated for these codes (without using a custom terminology server)?</p>",
