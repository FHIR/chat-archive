So that when someone for example enters <a href=\"http://fhir.de/ValueSet/arge-ik/klassifikation\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhir.de/ValueSet/arge-ik/klassifikation\">http://fhir.de/ValueSet/arge-ik/klassifikation</a> a rendered description is visible. Would that be possible when using solution (2)? We currently do that combining a HTTP redirect on <a href=\"http://fhir.de\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhir.de\">fhir.de</a> with a functionality of Simplifier.<br>\nMaybe that's also something we would leave to Simplifier even after including ART-DECOR into our tool chain, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191450\">@Simone Heckmann</span> ?</p>",
