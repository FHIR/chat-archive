Each release also includes refsets, cross-maps and added-value files.\"  It does not contain the drug extension, which is available monthly as a separate download.  It is time for us to make an update, since there is now a new 20200513 release.  I didn't include the drugs previously, both because they are a separate distribution and because to keep it fully up-to-date will require updating it monthly.  I don't know if we would need or want to commit to that, or conversely, would it still be sufficiently useful for our purposes here if we only updated it every 6 months at the same time as the general release?  We can decide how we want to do it and I will make the updates.</p>",
