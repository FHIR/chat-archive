It certainly will break some profiles which may have presumed that by having a differential element of valueBoolean, they were constraining value[x] to only booleans.  So from that perspective, it's a substantive change that *should* be in place for profilers to see the impact on their artifacts as they're working towards next Sunday's deadline.  But it's probably lower priority than the changes to the resources themselves.</p>",
