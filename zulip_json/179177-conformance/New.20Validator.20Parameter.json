You can't use the -profile parameter because that's the profile for the bundle itself. It's possible to write a bundle profile that invokes the right profile for the right resource, but this is very tedious. Instead, you can just ask the validator to validate a particular resource in the bundle against a given profile: </p>\n<p><code>-bundle {entry rule} {profile url}</code></p>\n<p>This invokes the nominated profile (by canonical URL) on any entry in any bundle validated that meets the entry rule. The entry rule is either a Resource name, a integer index, or both:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Patient - validate any patient against the nominated profile </li>\n<li>1 - validate the 1th resource (actually the second - index is 0 based) against the nominated profile</li>\n<li>Patient:0 - validate the first patient resource against the nominated profile</li>\n</ul>\n<p>E.g: </p>\n<p><code> java -jar validator_cli.jar c:\\temp\\bundle.xml -version 3.0 -ig hl7.fhir.us.core#1.0.1 -bundle Patient:0 http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient</code></p>",
