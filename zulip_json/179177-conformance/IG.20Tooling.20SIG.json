Questions we might look at are: what is the current intended scope?  Is there a need amongst tooling authors to have a shared representation of the input to/output of IG tooling?  One of the aims a flexible ecosystem of IG tools which editors can freely combine and which integrate as much as possible.</p>",

Vonk can already load SD's from a Simplifier project (<a href=\"http://docs.simplifier.net/vonk/features/artifactresolution.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://docs.simplifier.net/vonk/features/artifactresolution.html\">http://docs.simplifier.net/vonk/features/artifactresolution.html</a>), so this would be a good extension of that functionality. Questions also:<br>\n- Does the operation check whether the IG is 'self supporting', and what if it depends on conformance resources outside of the IG?<br>\n- Redirecting to an OO seems unneccessarily complex to me (we don't save the OO's we generate - do others?)</p>",

But that doesn't help if you just want to see if it is complete, and it would restart the process.<br>\nWhen you start the process, it waits for a couple of seconds, and if it isn't complete, returns the current status OperationOutcome.<br>\nThis will also be appropriate when I hand the generation off to another processing server (or queue the job).</p>",
