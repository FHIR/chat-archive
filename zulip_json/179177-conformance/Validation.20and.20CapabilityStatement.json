Some ideas on it's use:</p>\n<p>In my HAPI JPA servers I've been using CapabilityStatements to control how a server validates.  So if I receive a Patient, I would look at this to find the profile I support and then validate the resource against this (ignoring the supplied resource.meta.profile).</p>\n<p>In addition for message bundles (not hapi jpa) I would use CapabilityStatement to check messages received against MessageDefinitions I support.  Then control validation of the Bundle via the matched MessageDefinition. So if MessageDefinition says MedicationRequest profile A, I validate MedicationRequests in the Bundle against profile A).</p>\n<p>Does this behavior sound correct?</p>",
