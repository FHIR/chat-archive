Currently Forge explicitly hides the DomainResource.contained element (because I couldn't think of a use case). If necessary, I could change this and (optionally) display this element, so you can constrain it. This would be a relatively simple change.<br>\nAs for constraints on the Extension and/or modifierExtension elements, that's a bit more difficult to implement due to certain Forge-specific implementation details. Currently, the (modifier)Extension elements are completely managed by internal application logic, so the application cannot simply display these in the UI. This would require some more effort. And since not many users have asked for this feature, it doesn't look like we will implement this any time soon. Note that we also offer paid support services for Forge, which would allow you to submit priority change requests. If you are interested, please contact us for a quote.</p>",
