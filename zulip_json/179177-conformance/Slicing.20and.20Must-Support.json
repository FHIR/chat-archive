For example, if base-element is bound to FooValueSet, you don't need to repeat the binding; it's already implied.  Would this apply to Must-Support flags too?  Or do you repeat them in the slice even if the slice's base element is already marked Must-Support?</p>",

But I think it also still leaves some questions about how the IG Publisher will (or is expected to) handle the rendering for this.  For an element that is marked as mustSupport in the slicing base, will the publisher  automatically propagate that and render the corresponding element in each slice instance also as mustSupport (even without that being explicitly declared in the slice definition)?  Or must that still be done individually for any element in a slice definition if it's desired for the publisher to render that element as mustSupport?  And, if there is some automatic propagation of mustSupport in the rendering of the slice instances, could that behavior be overridden (if there was ever some reason or desire to do so) by explicitly declaring that element in the slice definition as mustSupport = false?</p>",
