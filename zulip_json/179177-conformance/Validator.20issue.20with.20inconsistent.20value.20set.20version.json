        "content": "<p>When the validator tries to resolve the value set binding for Composition.confidentiality it appends the wrong version.  In the base resource Composition.confidentiality has a required binding to <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ConfidentialityClassification\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ConfidentialityClassification\">http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ConfidentialityClassification</a>, with no version specified.  Our IPS Composition profile doesn't change that, but in validating the IPS example bundle against the IPS ig when the validator tries to resolve the value set in the terminology service it appends the version string '|4.0.0', which doesn't exist.  The only version of the v3-ConfidentialityClassification value set in the terminology service (or elsewhere) is '1', so the validator generates the warning:<br>\n<code>Warning @ Bundle.entry[1].resource.confidentiality (line 41, col33) : ValueSet http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ConfidentialityClassification|4.0.0 not found</code><br>\nI expect this may be happening because the validator is assuming that all value sets bound with required bindings will have their versions tied to the FHIR release? - but since this is a binding to a V3 value set that is clearly not true in this case.  I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised if this may be occurring in other places, as well.  Anyway, we need to figure out how to solve this so that the value set can be resolved correctly.  I'm wondering if setting the version to '1' in the profile would work (haven't tried that yet), but even if it does it wouldn't do anything to fix the underlying issue.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>?</p>",
