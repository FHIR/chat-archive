This updated dependency may complicate or prevent the installation of Forge on MacOS/Linux &amp; Wine. We are aware of and looking into the reported installation issues.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the latest (development) version of Wine seems to solve the newly introduced issues. Our team is currently testing an improved installation procedure for the Wine (MacOS/Linux) platform. Once verified, we will update and improve our online installation documentation accordingly.</p>\n<p><em>Stay tuned!</em></p>",
