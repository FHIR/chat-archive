Does this element's constraints apply only to boolean instances?<br>\n2. Are DateTime instances not allowed because of this element?<br>\n3. Could an element with path \"Patient.deceasedDateTime\" also appear in this profile?<br>\n4. Should the element with path \"Patient.deceased[x]\" continue to appear in the snapshot?</p>",

That's handled for me in the mapping column, so I don't actually have to use slicing.  But my profile supports both, and has both in it.  I'm still using spreadsheets though!</p>",
