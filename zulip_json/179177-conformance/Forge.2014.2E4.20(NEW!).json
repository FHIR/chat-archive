So older Forge versions failed to open any resources with unknown/unofficial codings etc. However we've changed the API and Forge to try and gracefully handle unknown enumeration values. Considering that the reported error message is complaining about an unknown ResourceType, we probably missed a spot. So if we can reproduce the issue, we should be able to pinpoint the offending line of code and fix it.</p>",
