I don't see that we have any means in the spreadsheet to represent the individual choice(s) in separate rows in order to be able to apply 'trial-use' in the Standards-Status column to the row(s) for one or more of those choices.  I already asked <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span> about this and he seemed to think that it would be a reasonable thing to request.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span>?</p>",
