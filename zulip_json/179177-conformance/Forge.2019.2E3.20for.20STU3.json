I see version 19.3 in the control panel. but not the old 16.3 (it was 16.x, not sure what it was). However, there are lots of files leftover from the November 2017 install date. For a while I had windows open for both versions (after I unstalled 19.3) but I closed the old one.</p>\n<p>So if I uninstall, I will just uninstall 19.3</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192228\">@Brian Reinhold</span>, the installation folders are created by ClickOnce in a deeply nested folder structure below %APPDATA%, with long and cryptic folder names. Usually, Forge installation folders will have a name that starts with \"forg\". You'd have to inspect the contents of the individual folders to determine which application and version they contain, e.g. by opening forge.exe file properties or readme.txt. If Windows prevents you from deleting a folder because files are in use, then that folder probably contains the currently running application version, and you should maintain/restore the folder contents.</p>",
