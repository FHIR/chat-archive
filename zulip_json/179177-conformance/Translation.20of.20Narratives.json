This extends string and markdown, my plan was to add the Narrative as context, and allow for xthml content.<br>\nI can I do this with forge ? I tried in different ways but I’ve not been able to find a clue…<br>\nwhat I found for xhtml is <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/rendering-xhtml\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/rendering-xhtml\">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/rendering-xhtml</a>, but this is an extension and not a profile; in the Narrartive dattype  xhtml seems to be handled as a custom data type; but I've not been able to replicate this in my profile...</p>\n<p>any help is more than welcome</p>",

Then you can constrain the narrative element in any resource profile by assigning the canonical url of the custom Narrative profile to the type.profile property of the Narrative type declaration. You can perform these steps in Forge. If you then reload the resource profile, Forge will try to expand the custom Narrative profile.</p>",
