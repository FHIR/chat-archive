This would allow a filter on snapshot view to show only elements in the 'scope of interest' for the profile - is this a good/bad idea and has there been any talk on this?  Not sure if we would need to distinguish elements  that are ignored but will be passed through (i.e. may be stored or reproduced in client outpits) vs ignored entirely (accepted but not processed at all)</p>",
