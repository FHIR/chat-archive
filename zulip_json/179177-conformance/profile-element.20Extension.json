The description on the extension states that the extension is used when a backbone element is being profiled, rather than an established type. Is it possible for this extension to be used on complex elements that aren't backbone elements?</p>",

The narrative description suggests it is for backbone elements, but that is not enforced via any constraints.  We're implementing this in SUSHI and want to know if we should support it in all cases or only for backbone elements.</p>\n<p>To provide a use case, however: US Core constrains <code>address</code> inline in the US Core Patient profile rather than providing an explicit profile on <code>Address</code>.  If I wanted to have my Patient profile constrain <code>address</code> the same way, I'd have to redefine all the constraints.  OR... I could use the profile-element extension to say that my profile's <code>address</code> takes on the constraints of <code>USCorePatientProfile.address</code> -- which establishes a more formal relationship and prevents unintentional misalignment.</p>",
