So either X or Y. And the patient has a histrory of either A or B or C.</p>\n<p>Currently the registry entry is filled out with a form by the practitioner, which just defines true/false to these question, but we translate those to the appropriate Medication/Condition/Observation resources. However, as far as I know, there is no way of expressing X or Y in FHIR in for example MedicationStatements is there? So I'm leaning towards creating registry specific codes for there cases, and in the future (when these items can be prepopulated by the EMR) these can be replaced by specific codes for X and Y.<br>\nHowever, this pattern is reoccuring, and it seems a bit of a shame that when we have 2 standardized codes that could be used, we cannot, and have to create and use something totally non-standardized, non-reusable. So I wanted to make sure there isn't any other option to express something like this.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions?</p>",

At the end of the day your problem boils down to uncertainty about the data, and allergyintolerance solves this <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extension-allergyintolerance-certainty.html\">with an extension</a>.</p>\n<p>I'd go for the following: record both of the drugs (so 2 resources), tie them together with a common identifier, and add a modifier (important) extension for the certainty.</p>\n<p>This'll make it more interoperable than custom codes - you'd be able to search on either drug using the standard interface with standard codes and you'll get a result. If you want to get more semantic information about it, you can, it'll be there thanks to the common identifier and the certain extension.</p>",

So your objective should be maximum safety - i.e. trigger the right decision support, show up in the right searches.  That means a separate resource for each of the 'or' clauses and flagging each of them as uncertain.  You can use extensions or common business identifiers in an attempt to link the collection as a single 'statement' but lots of systems won't recognize them.  So put in the code.text and ideally the narrative the full or-clause so a human can see it.</p>",
