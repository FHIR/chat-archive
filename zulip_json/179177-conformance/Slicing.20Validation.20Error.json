Although, the resource I've created doesn't conform against the Profile.  The error I am getting is <code>Problem evaluating slicing expression for element in profile http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/StructureDefinition/PractitionerProfile path Practitioner.telecom[0] (fhirPath = true and (use memberOf 'http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/contact-point-use|4.0.1')): null\"</code>. Is there something wrong with the way I have structured the slice ?  </p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!!</p>",
