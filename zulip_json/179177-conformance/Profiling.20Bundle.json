The validator isn't happy and I'm not sure whether that's because I'm doing something wrong or because we haven't set up @profile and @type to work with the type Resource (as opposed to Reference).  Presumably we'd hit the same issues with the Parameters data type and anywhere else Resource is permitted.  Has anyone tried slicing Bundle entries (and had success)?</p>",
