This would be a webpage the user could always go to to learn more about the resource.</p>\n<p>This is a bit similar to a canonical URL except a canonical URL's job is to unique identify the conformance resource and it might or might not resolve, whereas this master documentation will always resolve and doesn't have to be unique.</p>\n<p>I'm wondering on how to best represent it. Extension?
