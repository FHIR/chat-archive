This turns out to be an error in the FHIR specification.<br>\nThe double backslashes in the regex of the eld-16 constraint are incorrect here. It has been solved in FHIR standard 4.0.1, but unfortunately not in FHIR standard 3.0.2.<br>\nThis was reported in august 2017, but unfortunately not solved for STU3. See the original ticket here: <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-13771\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-13771\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-13771</a> and our ticket for the .NET API <a href=\"https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhir-net-api/issues/1219\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhir-net-api/issues/1219\">https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhir-net-api/issues/1219</a> </p>\n<p>The reason the Simplifier .NET validator now triggers the eld-16 is because it uses package 3.0.2 as the source which is in JSON format. The summary is that the eld-16 RegEx doesnâ€™t need backslashes for escaping the underscore in range, but if backslashes are used it should have been 4 backslashes for JSON.</p>",
