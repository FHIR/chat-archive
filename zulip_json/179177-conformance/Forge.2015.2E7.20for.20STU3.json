Because of breaking changes in FHIR STU3, the new Forge STU3 release no longer supports DSTU2 profiles. Forge for DSTU2 will no longer be further developed, as all our development efforts are now focused on Forge for STU3. However you can continue to use Forge for DSTU2 for as long as you need.</p>\n<p>Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or comments.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow (Friday May 5th), the Furore FHIR team is leaving for Madrid to attend the HL7 WGM and Connecthaton. We will all be available online throughout the week, but response times may be a bit longer than usual.</p>\n<p>Happy profiling!</p>",
