If not, then I'm afraid most existing constraining profiles don't conform to this invariant.<br>\n2) The specification should define a fhirpath expression (eld-XXX) to validate this invariant.<br>\n3) The invariant states \"with minimum cardinality = 1\". Shouldn't this be \"with minimum cardinality &gt;= 1\" ?</p>",
