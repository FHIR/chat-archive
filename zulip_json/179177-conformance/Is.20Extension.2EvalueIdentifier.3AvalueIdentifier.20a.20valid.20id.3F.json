An example of the element can be found in the <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/StructureDefinition-address-identifier.html\">Address Identifier Extension</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"XML\"><pre><span></span><code>{\n  \"id\": \"Extension.valueIdentifier:valueIdentifier\",\n  \"path\": \"Extension.valueIdentifier\",\n  \"sliceName\": \"valueIdentifier\",\n  \"min\": 1,\n  \"type\": [\n    {\n      \"code\": \"Identifier\",\n      \"profile\": [\n        \"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Identifier\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>When it comes to defining choice elements in a differential, I am familiar w/ two ways to notate the id. Using an element for the <code>value[x]</code> <code>Identifier</code> choice as an example, I'd expect one of these ids:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Extension.value[x]:valueIdentifier</code></li>\n<li><code>Extension.valueIdentifier</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is reinforced by the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/elementdefinition.html#id\">spec comments on ElementDefinition.id</a> and <a href=\"https://fire.ly/2019/09/13/type-slicing-in-fhir-r4/\">Firely's Type Slicing in FHIR R4</a> documentation.</p>\n<p>The example above, however, uses <code>Extension.valueIdentifier:valueIdentifier</code>, which seems to be a hybrid of the two documented approaches.  Is that considered a valid id?  I ask because I am trying to determine if we need to implement something in GoFSH to handle this use case.</p>",
