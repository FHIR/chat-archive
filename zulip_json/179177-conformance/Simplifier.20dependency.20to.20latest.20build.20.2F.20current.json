The IG in question is the <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/\">Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide on build.fhir.org</a>? Currently only the package releases are <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/packages/hl7.fhir.uv.genomics-reporting\">ending up in the package registry</a>.</p>\n<p>I understand <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179177-conformance/topic/dependent.20packages.20-.20simplifier/near/206799156\">this is the behaviour of the IG publisher</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If version is <code>dev</code>: It looks in only in your local cache</li>\n<li>If version is <code>current</code>: It looks first in your local cache, if not current anymore or not available looks in <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/</a></li>\n<li>If version is anything else: It looks first in your local cache, if not available looks in <a href=\"http://packages.fhir.org\">packages.fhir.org</a> (==packages.simplifier.net)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think for Simplifier I'd like <code>current</code> to refer to the current state of a project (the project linked to that package name). Question is how Simplifier should figure out where it should look for the <code>current</code> version, especially when there is not yet a released version of package yet.<br>\nOr should the user know where the project is being developed and should we go to <code>current-simplifier</code>, <code>current-fhirorg</code>, etc. (there's <a href=\"https://github.com/FHIR/ig-registry/blob/master/fhir-ig-list.json\">more places where packages come from</a>). <span aria-label=\"thinking\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f914\" role=\"img\" title=\"thinking\">:thinking:</span></p>",
