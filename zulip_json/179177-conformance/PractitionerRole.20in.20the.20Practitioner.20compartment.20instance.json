So, logically, every Resource instance that refers to a PractitionerRole of Practitioner X would belong to the Practitioner compartment instance X. This becomes more important, since PractionerRole itself becomes more important from R4.</p>\n<p>So either indirect references/links via PractitionerRole should be included in the above text and in the Practitioner CompartmentDefinition.</p>\n<p>Or, if there are reasons to not include that type of linkage, it should at least be explicitly stated that these indirect links are not included, maybe also on <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/compartmentdefinition-practitioner.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/compartmentdefinition-practitioner.html\">http://build.fhir.org/compartmentdefinition-practitioner.html</a> .</p>\n<p>I don't know if that has been discussed before, just came across that and didn't find any info.</p>",
