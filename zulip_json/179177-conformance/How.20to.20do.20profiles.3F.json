        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191368\">@Brett Esler</span>, you are on the right track. Constraints are expressed via a list of ElementDefinition components within a StructureDefinition resource. Forge will generate a differential (only constraints), but there is an option to generate a snapshot when you save to disk (not visible in the application to save memory). The registry at <a href=\"http://simplifier.net\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://simplifier.net\">simplifier.net</a> currently always expands the differential to a full snapshot, so you can see the full resource. One of the planned improvements on the simplifier platform is to provide a better indication of the changed elements. We already have the underlying infrastructure, so this will probably be available soon.</p>",
