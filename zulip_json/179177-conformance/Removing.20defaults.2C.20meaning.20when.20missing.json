We should encourage workgroups to create data models where no special <code>meaningWhenMissing</code> is required. </p>\n<p>Update 2.32.0.4.3 Missing Elements to indicate that \"missing\" should be synonymous with \"has no value\". This implies that \"meaning when missing\" applies to elements are not present and to elements that have no value.  It also implies that searches for <code>Patient?gender:missing=true</code> should return all patients without a gender value (including patients that have extensions but no value on gender). </p>\n<p>Update the examples in 2.32.0.4.3 Missing Elements to ensure they are up-to-date.</p>\n<p>Motivation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't think the advantage of smaller size and \"looks\" arguments for leaving out defaults of the instance weighs up to the disadvantages of having an inconsistent or more complex processing of the data, opportunity of miscommunication (\"sender did not know\" vs. \"have to assume the default\")</li>\n<li>Since implementing special cases (which default behaviour is used) can introduce implementer mistakes, we would strongly suggest committees change any element with a default value to be mandatory.   </li>\n<li>The current list of such elements that would be made mandatory is relatively small.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This motion will require community consultation.</p>",

I can see how eliminating defaultValue[x] could be beneficial for StructureDefinitions that define something FHIR, but when it comes to usage for V2/V3 defaults just exist, and if StructureDefinition doesn't do that then we cannot handle V2/V3 anymore. E.g. @negationInd has a default of 'false'. So unless I'm missing something, it seems like a bad idea  to completely loose defaultValue. Maybe an invariant to scope it to V2/V3 is an option?</p>",
