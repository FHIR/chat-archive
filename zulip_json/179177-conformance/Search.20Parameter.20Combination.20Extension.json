I guess it might be possible in an IG, through the dependsOn to force that the search parameter has been defined somewhere in the IG scope. It does seem like at best a warning, which would enable an IG author to ignoreWarnings...</p>",

My suggestion is to validate that the combined search parameters found within CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.extension are also present as individual search parameters (as MAY, if support for the individual search parameter is not part of the IG) in CapabilityStatement.rest.resoource.searchParam. That way at least the type of each component in the combined parameters has to be declared. This is within the \"power\" of the IG author to make sure it is present.</p>\n<p>Whether CapabilityStatement.rest.resoource.searchParam.definition is present, that is currently optional, but it is nice to have too.</p>",
