The 4 extensions are visible in the latter in Forge, and also appear in the detailed view of simplifier.  The issue is that the overview of \"fr-organization-pole\" in simplifier shows only the last extension. It looks like an issue on showing a differential based on another differential in simplifier. Both profiles are in HL7 France project on simplifier. Any explanation? Thanks.</p>",
