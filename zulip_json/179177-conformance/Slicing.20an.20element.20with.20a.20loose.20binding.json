        "content": "<p>An element like PractitionerRole.code comes with an Example valueset binding which doesn't really constrain it or any potential slices and isn't used for validation.  My scenario here is this - I don't think that valueset is usable but I want to preserve it for intake in case someone wants to use it.  We will use a concept map to convert it internally.  At the same time, I want to add another value set for internal use that is more robust but will conflict with the original.  Since the root binding is Example, what do I need to do to make that use case work?  I was thinking to leave the root alone and add slices that have 0..1 cardinalities but have fixed value code.systems for each of the slices.  Is that the right way to do it?  If I change the binding at the root, wouldn't that further constrain all of the slices by default?  Thanks</p>",

It's merely to give a sense of what types of codes might exist.  Also, there's no need to retain a binding to allow implementers to use it.  Unless you close slicing or do something else that over-constraints the profile, implementers can always send other codes</p>",
