That is comprehensible because <code>Questionnaire</code> is derived from <code>MetadataResource</code> and <code>MetadataResource</code> is derived from <code>CanonicalResource</code> where the element <code>url</code> is introduced. <br>\nI know that <code>MetadataResource</code> and <code>CanonicalResource</code> are meant to be interfaces, so <code>Questionnaire</code> implements interface <code>MetadataResource</code> and does not have a <code>is a</code> relationship. But how should I know that?</p>\n<p>I made now a hack so that the base.path  is now  <code>Questionnaire.url</code> for element <code>url</code>, because I think that is right. Do you think as well that is the right path?</p>",
