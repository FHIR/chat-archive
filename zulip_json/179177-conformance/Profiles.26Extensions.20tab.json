The profiles &amp; extensions tab shows up on <em>resources</em> in the official FHIR spec to show what profiles and extensions HL7 has defined for that resource.  If you're defining an IG, you're not defining a resource so it doesn't really make sense to have such a tab.  You can't indicate that certain profiles or extensions are only allowed to appear in a specific profile, so there'd be no meaning such a tab.  That said, you can change the templates for your IG to have whatever tabs you like saying whatever you like.  But you'll need to learn Jeckyl well to understand how to do that.  It's not the simple sort of thing that can be easily expressed here.</p>",
