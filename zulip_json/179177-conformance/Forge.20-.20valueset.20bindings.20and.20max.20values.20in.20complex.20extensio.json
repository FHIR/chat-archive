If you edit a complex extension with a valueset binding and save, Forge loses the valueset binding.  It also loses max cardinality values.</p>",

Recently I've been working on improved snapshot generation, also a key part of proper change tracking. I'm planning to improve change tracking after the HL7 WGM in Baltimore.</p>",
