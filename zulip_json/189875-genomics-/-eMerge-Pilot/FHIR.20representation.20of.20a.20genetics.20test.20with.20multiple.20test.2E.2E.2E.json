A panel order  <strong>BRCA panel order</strong>/ BRCA 1 result / BRCA 2 result <br>\n3. A reflexive order   that is say, <strong>BRCA reflexive panel order</strong> (order 1, see 2 for results)/ BRCA 1 gene analysis (order 2)  or BRCA 2 gene analysis (order 3) (only performed if BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 screening panel are positive.  If either, both neg, then not performed)<br>\n4. A Profile order that is say, <strong>BRCA genetic profile order (grandparent tier)</strong>/  BRCA panel order (parent 1 tier)   +  BRCA sequencing (parent 2 tier)/ BRCA 1 result (parent 1 result child 1) + BRCA 2 result (parent 1 result child 2) + BRCA sequencing results (parent 2 result child 1) + BRCA sequencing interpretation (parent 2 result child 2)</p>\n<p>Service Request order instance order would be used to reflect in the Profile each \"2nd tier\"  or additional order such in cases 3, 4 as the original medical/legal request from the provider is still valid with the original order to be used for performing the remainder of the orders.</p>\n<p>If any of the orders are panels say for a list of genes, markers, drugs (for PGX), performed then a panel order would be comprised of:</p>\n<p>Panel X order</p>\n<p>result A observation<br>\nresult B observation<br>\nresult C observation</p>\n<p>Panel Y order<br>\nresult D observation<br>\nresult E observation<br>\nresult F observation</p>\n<p>In the Diagnostic Report Resource would expect to see the \"groupings\" /report sections as discussed.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>Grandparent profile order is at the top as the name of the test ordered/reported</p>\n<p>Panel X order, now is listed as a report section/grouping header/observation (of observations) level</p>\n<p>result A represented as observation (A)<br>\nresult B represented as observation (B)<br>\nresult C represented as observation (C)</p>\n<p>Note each observation value may be short answer/nom(i.e. ISCN, HGVS or other genetic notation);  narrative/text blob such as an interpretation/Impact/clinical significance as modeled with the CG Implementation Guide depending on the section/type of genetic/molecular results reported.</p>\n<p>It shows how DR results originate and are connected to the order/Service Request.  The other aspect not mentioned/listed is the specimen info upon which all the results were generated. It is also needed.  Where labs have testing on tissue or swab specimens such as with many genetics, microbiology and pathology results, they will have an Ask at Order Entry (AOE) question requesting the ordering provider to indicate the source of the specimen or when it has been collected from (i.e breast tissue, swab from inner cheek).  It should be indicated in specimen resource as to how specimen was collected (in appropriate containers, additives, time in fixative, etc.) too.  AOEs are often reported as individual result components such as the observations that would be reported as part of the Diagnostic Report.</p>",

They are each individually built most likely in the LIS so aspects like quality control can be documented for each as performed as well as dropping billing for additional work needed for more complex cases.  </p>\n<p>Each report section can be added accordingly depending on what is performed, similar to structured pathology cases (will likely see examples when the CIC folks join Wed).  Overall interpretation contains interpreted text blob.  Although may wish at some point to add sub sub sections for management recommendations, family screening, etc.  to get to more discrete data capture/encoding.  References section is like similar labs and also includes the vendor info.  Other labs also include the required performance requirements, noted here in the footnote, as another report section, which I'd recommend so it's structured the same way across labs.</p>\n<p>The Activity Definitions, create Service Requests when using \"$apply\" operation, and it works great (according to another thread).  We're still working through SpecimenDefinition needs.   Results are from ObservationDefinition.  All in FHIR R4 resources.</p>\n<p>In Theory all genetics, cytogenetics, molecular diagnostics, FISH, etc orders, including those not orderable by the provider, but those that reflex in the lab such as some of Larry Babb's comments indicate, would be model-able.  Would be great to get genetics examples into Service Catalog to test at upcoming connectathon so folks can see it in action.</p>",
