The LMM/Broad labs work together to produce one side of the results, but I believe the LMM takes full responsibility for the contents and therefore the Broad's CLIA# is not needed. if it is I will simply add two performer's (I think). Again, not worried as I have not seen the need for this, so we will presume 1 at this point. Plenty of other issues to resolve that have much more value.</p>",
