The <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/diagnosticreport.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/diagnosticreport.html\">DR resource</a> refers to this field as the name/code for this diagnostic report. This is a fixed value and thinking more about this, a code indicating that this is a genetic test seems appropriate for computation but in that case, where do we include the lab defined name of the test in the DR? As labs seem to mostly have custom names for their tests, it might not be easy to represent the same as LOINC codes? I apologize if I misunderstood or misrepresented any information.</p>",
