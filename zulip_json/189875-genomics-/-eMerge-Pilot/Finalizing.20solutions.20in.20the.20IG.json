Can <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191913\">@Kevin Power</span> or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192198\">@Bob Freimuth</span> suggest how <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196626\">@Mullai Murugan</span> and I should coordinate the final decisions on these questions with the CG group's oversite?  We want to do our best to take a path that will help promote the IG standard development process such that our effort stays in alignment with the IG.</p>\n<p>Please suggest a model to capture, coordinate and finalize decisions that are agreeable with the CG IG process.</p>",

        "content": "<p>To get 'finalized and approved consensus from the CG group', we will ultimately need a well defined tracker logged.  The best way to ensure the tracker is aligned with the direction of the IG and still address your problem is to engage this community, so this is the right place to start.  To your last point - Zulip is a great tool for many things, but it does have its limits.  From what I have seen so far, you have some big questions that require some thought, and I am afraid that using only Zulip will not provide you everything you need to 'capture, coordinate, and finalize decisions' - so I do have a few ideas.</p>\n<p>I suggest that you/Mullai create one or more documents reflecting each problem statement and frame up possible solutions. These documents will make sure information is consolidated rather than spread over multiple threads and replies on Zulip. Google Docs would be fine for this if you are so inclined, and the links to those docs can be shared on Zulip if you want others to review directly.</p>\n<p>As needed, ask questions here to refine the problem statements or get feedback on possible solutions. The feedback can be fed into the documents. Or,  if at some point you prefer an in-person discussion, let a co-chair know and we can get it added to an in-person meeting agenda. The intention is to use the docs to provide a consolidated view of the problem and solutions.</p>\n<p>Once we have a sense of the right solution to a problem, and can describe the IG change needed to support that solution, we need a gForge tracker.   From there, the normal group process takes over. I will add that the more well defined the final solution is, the easier it is to process the tracker - so we have an incentive to make a clear request.  And if someone has a question about the tracker while we are voting on it, having the thinking clearly documented is an easy way to share.</p>\n<p>Hope that makes sense, and doesn't sound to onerous.  I welcome feedback from others.</p>",
