If you look in ClinVar you will find a number of interpretations that have multiple conditions/phenotypes/diseases (all the same thing - for our purposes here).  When this occurs we need to allow the reporting lab to group more than one phenotype to create a custom composite condition that best represents the condition that the variant is associated with.

This is not about what conditions the patient has but what conditions have been associated with a change at a specific position in some patient's genome. So, we need a model for knowledge. ClinVar includes evidence, and the summary page has several fields that are useful. Also, the entries demonstrates a need for a model of inherited condition that includes inheritance pattern.

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192123\">@Bret H</span> I'm still confused (I think). </p>\n<p>When reporting molecular diagnostic interpretations, folks often confuse the notion that the lab is providing a diagnosis or making a direct statement about the condition of the patient/subject. It isn't.  It IS saying that a clinically significant variant has been found in the patient based on the regions sequenced and analyzed by the diagnostic methodology used.  But to arrive at the point where the lab determines to report on an identified variant found in the sequencing portion of the test (that is to say it is either \"clinically significant\" or \"uncertain as to its significance\" or even \"benign but interesting because its novel\"), the lab will research the variant independent of the patient to gather evidence that can support or refute its pathogenicity for a genetic condition (well defined or specific) that is in the same domain as the indication for testing.  It may not be a condition that the patient has. The \"molecular interpretation\" or \"inherited disease pathogenicity\" result is a related assertion about the variant that happened to be found in the patient. It is not stating that the patient has the disease or will have the disease/condition.</p>\n<p>The labs that create their own assertions (like those that they submit to ClinVar) reuse this patient independent information to share with providers when a patient is found to have that variant and a related indication.  </p>\n<p>So, we need to be able to allow the labs to convey a \"genetic condition\" in any form they want. While its a nice idea to restrict them to OMIM or Orphanet or DOID or MeSH or UMLS or SNOMED or other coded diseases, these genetic conditions aren't always cleanly defined and available. So, from time to time, the clinical lab feels more comfortable reporting a set of disease/phenotypes to lump or split the available options.  There is a continual domain level effort going on in ClinGen and the community to allow expert groups to lump and split diseases and request that the authoring systems like omim, mondo (monarch initiative), doid, orphanet, etc... will generate codes when they are needed. But the state of genetic conditions is still quite volatile. </p>\n<p>This is one of the main reasons we can't simply say \"let's use snomed codes for genetics\" or \"let's just use OMIM\".</p>\n<p>I realize that folks will misuse it, but I don't think that's our concern. We are a \"guide\" and a specification to \"enable\" the ability to report what is needed to be reported. </p>\n<p>In the end, I'm fine if you leave it as a cardinality of 1. We can always provide our own extensions if necessary in order to get the job done.</p>",

It is much more likely that some/most of the multiple disease assertions are situations where both diseases satisfy the single interpretation and it should be two separate interpretations. However, lots of folks struggle with the number of disease authorities and potential for similar or nearly similar diseases, so they tend to put multiple to make sure that all groups understand that either is appropriate for their interpretation.</p>",

I don't think the comma-delimited list would be considered a single reference (if you disagree please discuss).  Finally, for precision, in case others are using this. I would have made the \"clinvar\" reference a type='justification' for sure and used a url that would have more precisely linked it to the SCV record SCV000271348.2 with version so that it clearly points to the LMM submission and is not mistaken for the entire set of assertions associated with variation ID <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/53685/#clinical-assertions\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/53685/#clinical-assertions\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/53685/#clinical-assertions</a>.</p>",

It does raise an interesting point if you'd like to be able to relate an artifact that is not dereference-able with a URL you will be out of luck.  I think the SCV could be treated as a coding type with a system and value of \"ClinVar\" and \"SCV000271348.2\" but that does not help us with RelatedArtifact. Maybe this is a case where some RelatedArtifacts are simply general pointers that contain the true source of \"justification\" that the producer of the record is trying to reference. I suppose this approach runs the danger of consumers of the information reading too much into what is meant by the relatedArtifact, but then that would be a consumer issue I suppose.</p>\n<p>On a related note, we (ClinGen and GA4GH) are continuing to sort out standards around linking structured evidence that supports assertions (like statements of pathogencity) where supporting and (refuting) evidence is more precisely communicated. I think this is likely out of scope for FHIR at this time (maybe the CDS or CQI workgroups will be tackling this eventually).</p>",

The document could be attached or use the link in the related artifact to a profile that has the details of where the record is.  Regards statements of pathogenicity - I do hope you'll look at the components in the observation example for inherited disease. The components are quite useful and are meant to cover the area. But based on what you are describing, a profile for guidlines might fit the bill. But the profile is meant to be used as part of clinical pathways, so it might not be perfect. Totally agree that CDS and CQI groups could benefit from input in creating knowledge artifacts for genetic knowledge - be really awesome if the NLM took on the responsibility of maintaining a repository of public knowledge. We'll have to get used to not including the evidence in the documentation sent to the EMR - references in FHIR are awesome (check out URIs in the FHIR spec - you specify the endpoint, profile name and ID). If ClinGen used that for their records then using SCV000271348.2  would be a snap. It would be better than having to use components to accomplish the task. What you will get is a link from the observation to the supporting knowledge artifacts.  Love to see EMERGE at the connectathon or at a break-out session. Do you know if anyone is coming?</p>",

I do think that they offer tons of flexibility in allowing users to represent complex observations using a broad group of attributes that can be stitched together in a multitude of ways.

It would also enable us to use these definitional resources or data types to build more complex and standard variant structures and avoid the ObsGenotype derivesFrom ObsHaplotype derivesFrom ObsVariant situation which is not useful in moving in the direction of computationally reliable and clinically accurate genetic test result findings. </p>\n<p>The term guidelines to me is more about the methods and SOPs defined by groups like ACMG, CAP, AMP, ASCO, etc.. that provide standards for how the assessment of variation is to be performed in a consistent and useful manner to support clinical practices.
