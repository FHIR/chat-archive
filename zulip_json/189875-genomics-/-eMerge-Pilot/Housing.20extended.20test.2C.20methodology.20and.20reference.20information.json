Is the field currently available to house method information  part of the Observations resource?  And is this a coded value? If so, what are other possible options to house all related information about a Genetics test? Could the Regions Studied resource be expanded further to house this kind of information? <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/FZOvoltvPPZxMaDjZNpsXguv/SampleReportTemplateAllPositiveforgForge.docx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"SampleReportTemplateAllPositiveforgForge.docx\">SampleReportTemplateAllPositiveforgForge.docx</a></p>\n<p>More info from <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"209510\">@Larry Babb</span> <br>\nEach of the highlighted numbered items in the Methodologies and Test Limitations section on pages 5-6 could be considered separate test methodologies that produce results that are used for subsequent methods and analytic results. It seems that the ServiceRequest is one way to codify these methodologies, but it is not clear specifically how to deal with the complexity and also link it to the specific observations that result from each assay's methods.</p>\n<p>Another approach may be to use loinc codes (in the Observations) to define the specific question being answered by the result. If we are to create/define LOINC codes that represent the specific methods/assays that might work, but it is not clear that is a reasonable approach. </p>\n<p>We may be able to consider this report a composite report made up of 3 smaller reports. If so, then it may be worth exploring the notion of nested DiagnosticReports. However, it is not clear whehter this would hold up for all genetic testing result scenarios. It is also not clear whether HL7 FHIR supports the notion of composite reporting.</p>\n<p>Details also in the gforge tracking item <a href=\"https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=19827\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=19827\">#19827</a>,</p>",
