It should be easier to find the discussions here, and it may be easier to keep the discussions going between Connectathons, as well.  Here is the link to the prior discussions on the implementers stream:<br>\n<a href=\"https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/implementers/subject/Connectathon.20Terminology.20Services.20Track\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/implementers/subject/Connectathon.20Terminology.20Services.20Track\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/implementers/subject/Connectathon.20Terminology.20Services.20Track</a></p>\n<p>For Connectathon 16 we are working on additional test scripts and capabilities for doing more formal terminology services testing.  We will post more details on that here and on the Wiki.  We would like to encourage all terminology service providers (both previous and new) to participate in this, and we welcome suggestions for and contributions of additional test cases and test scripts.  </p>\n<p>We would also like again to encourage everyone working on the other tracks to incorporate and integrate the use of terminology services into your development and testing as much as possible.  If there are questions about how to do that or issues that you encounter, feel free to post them here or on the terminology stream and we'll be happy to try to help in working out the details.</p>",
