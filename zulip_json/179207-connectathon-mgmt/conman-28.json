It's safe for trackleads to make whatever changes they would like (if you assign yourself as the TL in the track then only you can make changes.). We will be able to migrate your updates to future events if you wish.</p>\n<p>One thing in particular you may want to consider is to associate the track with the IG's you are testing. To do this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ensure the IG is listed in conman (add it if not - and adding the package id / version will enable a link to the registry)</li>\n<li>Edit the track, changing the track type to 'IG review', then selecting the tracks you are testing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you do that, then when adding a test result, it can be associated with an IG and these can be listed / downloaded from the results tab.</p>",
