If you are thinking of using conman, then there are a couple of extra steps:</p>\n<p>If you are testing an IG, then you'll want to create a link from the track to the IG/s. To do this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check that the IG is in the list of IGs - add it if not</li>\n<li>From the Track tab, click on the edit icon to the right of the track name, which will bring up the edit dialog. Make sure the track type is 'IG Review' and you should have a list of IGs in a dropdown. Select the one you want, then click the green 'add' button to add a link from the track.</li>\n<li>you may want to add yourself as the track lead - then only you can make changes. Sorry, right now there is only a single track lead</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to use conman to capture feedback (and I'll be sending out more info shortly) then you'll need at least one scenario. To do this</p>\n<ul>\n<li>select the track</li>\n<li>in the description tab to the right you'll see an 'Add a new scenario' link. Clicking that brings up the scenario dialog.</li>\n<li>give the scenario a name and a brief description, then Add. (You can do more, but that's probably enough for most). This will allow users to add feedback from testing to the scenario</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any issues report them here - it's great to get this stuff sorted well ahead of time if possible so we have time to resolve any issues...</p>",
