Then, during the hands-on time that afternoon, we'll secure a projector and both Epic and Cerner will show how to integrate with our respective platforms and ecosystems.</p>\n<p>We are excited to see the ideas that you're planning to build on top of FHIR!  For those that would like a starting point, we will have a javascript starter app available to load a Patient and some of their Observations, which you can continue customizing throughout the conference.  Whatever app you start with, both EHR vendors will allow you to register your app urls so that you can simulate an application launch.</p>\n<p>For Cerner's tutorial, please ensure you have a GitHub account, and for the best experience, have Ruby installed to assist with app deployment.  We'll also have alternate deployment instructions for those without Ruby.</p>\n<p>We're excited to meet you, learn with you, and hack with you next week!</p>",
