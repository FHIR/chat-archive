If you refer me to a specialist and make my data available to him is there any reason I shouldn't be able to get a copy of that data too?  I'd be interested in participating in an integration track because I am sure it is not as easy as that but at the same time I might be able to add some ideas about how it could be made easier to achieve as a goal.</p>",
