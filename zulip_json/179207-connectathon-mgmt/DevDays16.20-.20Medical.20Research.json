There will be an intro to medical research in general on Thursday at 9:45, after that we'll dig in. For those interested in ResearchKit/ResearchStack, there will be a tutorial on Friday at 9:00.</p>\n<p>Please attend any session on Wednesday that stills your hunger! Depending on your FHIR proficiency, you might choose the FHIR introduction session, then maybe the SMART on FHIR session at 10:30 and Structured data capture/Questionnaire session at 11:15.</p>\n<p>We will likely work on data collection on mobile devices (can also be web services) and how to deliver this data back to the researcher. This also involves servers that accept (encrypted?) data from these devices as well as backend servers that might do analytics or even show visualizations of the responses coming in. You can read up on one such toolchain on <a href=\"http://c3-pro.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://c3-pro.org\">http://c3-pro.org</a> if you so desire. Looking forward! ü§òüèº</p>",
