And advice?  We're planning on taking attendence, meeting minutes, and trying to run the meetup in the same spirit as the official connectathons and working groups.  <br>\nAbby</p>",

There was interest all around in continuing regular meetups and holding quarterly mini-connectathons for the foreseeable future, as well as perhaps coordinating travel to the Working Group(s) and DevDays.  </p>\n<p>We held 5 votes total, including an affirmative unanimous vote to apply/register as an HL7 Regional Meetup and Connectathon.  We also have some meeting minutes to register on the Wiki.</p>",
