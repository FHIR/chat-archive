The question is on the choice of where to place member numbers. The Patient resource typically holds business identifiers related to the person's record in the system (in this case the payer system). We seem to be using it for that in some cases, but are placing it in a Coverage resource in other cases, within this implementation.  A business identifier in a resource is something that identifies the resource, so shouldn't that apply to a Coverage resource as well? i.e. does an MB uniquely identify the Coverage, or doesn't it really identify the Patient (member record)?</p>",

Yeh, it's an absolute requirement to support <code>$member-match</code> and <code>Task</code>-based requests for PCDE and for CDex.  It was introduced in the May 2020 FHIR Connectathon, and again in Sept 2020.  Oh well.  Not sure if you have time to refactor your code today, but if not, then happy to take this offline afterwards and schedule a time for testing your implementation when it's ready.</p>",

Could we connect and try it out with you? By the way, in PCDe there are two payers, let's say PayerA that submits a task to PayerB, PayerB prepares Communicaiton Bundle and updates Task to complete. So opiton1,  we could act as a PayerA who submit a task to Mitre (Mitre becomes PayerB). Also, option 2,  we could be PayerB who gets the Task from Mitre (Mitre becomes PayerA). Let me know if we could connect and which option we could use.</p>\n</blockquote>",
