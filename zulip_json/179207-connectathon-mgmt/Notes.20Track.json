The goal of this track would be to give us a discrete and scoped workflow to test notes at a connectathon and from there, aid our many notes conversations with concrete input from testing. </p>\n<p>Who would be interested in participating?<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191357\">@Andrew Torres</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191356\">@Jenni Syed</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191410\">@Brett Marquard</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191401\">@Eric Haas</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191936\">@Michael Donnelly</span></p>",
