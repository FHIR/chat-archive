And whatever thoughts you or any of us have on how to make this happen with the other groups in San Antonio are certainly welcome.  I think the first step is probably to reach out with something concrete to the other track leads (at least for the particular tracks where it makes sense) that they can be considering soon - and I think we would want to do that by mid-December (sufficiently prior to the holidays) at the latest.  And, yes, this is the right stream/topic - we just didn't end up using it for anything for the September event (although I'm sure we should have).</p>",

The alternative symbol, capital L, was adopted by the 16th CGPM (1979, Resolution 6) in order to avoid the risk of confusion between the letter l (el) and the numeral 1 (one).\"  So, I guess you and I read books that listed different symbols (rather than both) from SI.

So if at least one from every track could attend (subject to room limits!), that would be great.  We would like to hear about your needs and experiences and frustrations, and intend to offer help and suggestions for meeting your needs during this session and this weekend.  We're focusing on SNOMED CT as it's the most complex and broadly useful clinical terminology and nearly everyone needs and uses at least a part of it, but what we will cover likely applies to most other terminologies, as well.  The effort during this Connectathon is in alignment with and supported by the work being done in the Terminology Services stream of the joint <em>SNOMED on FHIR</em> project of SNOMED International and HL7, which is producing a <em>SNOMED on FHIR</em> FHIR IG (so stay tuned for that).</p>",

Overall, I think it was really amazing.  It was definitely different from what we've done before - and we all learned a lot.  We'll certainly have some things that we've learned and experiences that we can bring forward to our future Connectathon events (whether virtual, or in-person, or a combination of those).  This time I think we  ended up with the emphasis leaning more than usual toward discussion and education, and probably less actual connecting.  In the future maybe we can strike a something more even balance on that - now that we have a better idea of how that might work in this environment - we do have a lot of things that we need to test, so we'll definitely be working on that.  Please fill out the survey and provide any other feedback that you have, here or directly to me or Peter or anyway that works.  I've already heard the suggestion that each Connectathon track should have its own Zulip stream, so we can have multiple topics and have easier and more consistent visibility.  I had already thought that we should probably do that, and I think we'll go ahead and set that up and will announce that generally and here when that is ready - and then we can continue to \"connect\" and share our thoughts, ideas and questions until the next time.

The conflict that we thought we had that caused us to start 15 minutes later isn't really there, and we can also go a little longer up until the track highlights session begins at 12:30.  I do have a conflict and will need to be in an IPS session for the first 60 minutes, but we should have other \"experts\" there and I'll plan to join for the last part.  And finally, also in order to avoid conflicts with IPS I've taken the liberty to request both rescheduling and shortening our Terminology Services track wrap-up session and moving it to 3:30 - 4:00 PT.  That's just before the final wrap-up session for the Connectathon itself, and I hope that won't cause a problem for anyone.  Will talk tomorrow!</p>",
