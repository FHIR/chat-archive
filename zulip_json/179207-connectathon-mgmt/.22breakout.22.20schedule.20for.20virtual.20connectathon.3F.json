Each Track Lead will be given zoom credentials to run their zoom for their own track and you are encouraged to schedule at least two \"status\" sessions where people who are not on  for the entire time can check in. All meeting credentials will be sent out Wednesday morning. We will publish the list of all tracks with their respective chat stream and zoom links listed as well. That will come out via email Wednesday morning also.</p>",
