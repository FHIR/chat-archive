I wanted to let you know that the Connectathon Wiki has been replaced! WHAT?! That’s right. We are moving Connectathon communication from the wiki to the HL7 Confluence site so be sure to bookmark the Connectathons page under FHIR &gt; Implementers and then watch it for updates. If you don’t have access to confluence yet go to <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/\">https://confluence.hl7.org/</a> to request access. <br>\nPlease enter your track proposal into CONFLUENCE no later than March 21st, 2019. That’s only one week away! <br>\nQuestions? Just ask!<br>\nSandy Vance<br>\nHL7 FHIR Connectathon Administrator<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:Sandy.vance@aegis.net\" title=\"mailto:Sandy.vance@aegis.net\">Sandy.vance@aegis.net</a><br>\n614.273.5916</p>",
