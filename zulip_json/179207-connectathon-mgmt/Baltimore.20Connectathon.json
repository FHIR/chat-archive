The origin of the problem is that the reservations were made 2 years ago, and not enough space was reserved. We have a single room with space for ~200 people (depends how hard we cram it). From about 2pm on Saturday, the room can be expanded to fit ~350 people... but not until then. The hotel can make another room available to us 13 floors away that fits 150 people until 2pm</p>",
