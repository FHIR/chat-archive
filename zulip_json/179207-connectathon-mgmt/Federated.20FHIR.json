I've brought the issue up at Patient Empowerment, Clinicians on FHIR, and elsewhere.  We need to create a work product of a patient history that can be baselined and then split up and registered across the different EHRs; that way, when we fetch and merge accordingly, we can validate that the composite is the same as the reference baseline.</p>",
