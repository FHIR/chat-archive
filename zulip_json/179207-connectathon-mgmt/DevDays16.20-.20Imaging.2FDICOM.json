        "content": "<p>Hi all - looking forward to DevDays next week, and looking at imaging / DICOM topics! </p>\n<p>The Imaging/DICOM track focuses on the integration of medical imaging content and workflows into FHIR. Topics include the clinical workflow of a typical imaging department (from order to acquisition to report) and how FHIR complements it, a deep-dive of the imaging-specific FHIR resources, and an introduction to the DICOM / DICOMweb standard (international specification on medical imaging). Both radiology (X-rays, CTs) and enterprise imaging (photographs, point-of-care ultrasounds) concepts will be covered. In addition, IHE related imaging profiles that include FHIR (like MHD-I) will be reviewed.</p>",
