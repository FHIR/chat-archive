        "content": "<p>Hi, <br>\nNot to distract from the work going on in Koln, but I have a question about ad-hoc connectathons.  It turns out that some of the medical school and business school students at UChicago decided to organize a health tech hackathon this week.  We have a new Trauma Center opening up at the University, and the hackathon theme is 'Trauma', which is ostensibly the same as 'Acute Care' use case from the Clinicians on FHIR group.  I've talked with the organizer, and they're anticipating about 40 people to attend (including 3 to 6 from the Biomedical Informatics program); which seems like it's enough to qualify for an ad-hoc connectathon or Clinicians on FHIR session.  </p>\n<p>So, where do we begin with something like this?  Are there any introductory materials or on-ramping materials for groups holding local connectahons?  Are there any considerations we need to keep in mind regarding the HL7 brands and trademarks?  </p>\n<p>We're tentatively planning on doing a presentation on FHIR and the Clinician on FHIR usecases, and to try to rally the ~40 folks around using interoperability standards.  We've also been working on making the Meteor on FHIR platform available through the University tech-transfer program; so the teams who are starting from scratch can build directly on a FHIR platform.   </p>\n<p>Any thoughts much appreciated.<br>\nAbigail</p>",

Yes, we're definitely interested in flow-charting and diagraming these usecases as a next step.  Are you going to be at FHIR DevDays in Boston this year?

About 40 to 50 people showed; of which maybe a half-dozen were organizers, and another dozen were mentors.  Probably a 3:1 ratio of students : professionals; divided into 5 teams.  A lot of greenfield projects, where folks were just wireframing ideas.  There were maybe a half-dozen of us who were experienced enough to be standing up actual systems.  We wound up getting 3 or 4 FHIR Servers up and running during the connectathon, and were mostly focused on non-clinical resources such as Location, Organization, and RelatedPerson.  Our team implemented a $near geospatial operator for proximity detection, with an eye towards first-responder applications.   We had a lot of learnings about how to run Meteor on FHIR framework within a hackathon environment; including what we need in a custom settings.json file, and how we might use IPFS to autosynchronize datasets.  All in all, it went really well!</p>",
