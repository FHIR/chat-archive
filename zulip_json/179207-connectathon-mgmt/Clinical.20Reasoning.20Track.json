Initial plan would be to build a service that acts as an intermediary to implement the bulk standard and feed individual resources to an existing FHIR server. This seems to meet one of the track goals (\"Demonstrate submission using bulk data serialization\") and implements one the Summary Report Scenario.  I could use some feedback...

Unlike other Connectathons, the sandbox CQF Ruler (<a href=\"http://cqm-sandbox.alphora.com/cqf-ruler-r4/fhir/\">http://cqm-sandbox.alphora.com/cqf-ruler-r4/fhir/</a>) should only be used for the r4.0.1 measures.  The dstu3 and r4 will error if run in the sandbox.  </p>\n<p>Furthermore, there is no hosted CQF Ruler for dstu3 or r4.  If you would like to run those measures please spin up a CQF Ruler instance.  The instructions and options are in the QuickStart (<a href=\"https://github.com/DBCG/connectathon/wiki/Quickstart\">https://github.com/DBCG/connectathon/wiki/Quickstart</a>).</p>",

You are right to point me to Atom with the Plug-in. Isn't that tool much less convenient though?

In Atom you do have to write the CQL and in MAT it does provide a UI to generate the CQL for you. For testing against FHIR data you can either use the CQF-Ruler to test or in Atom you can create FHIR test data and test directly in Atom.
