Navigate to <a href=\"http://conman.fhir.org/connectathon.html?event=baltimore2018\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://conman.fhir.org/connectathon.html?event=baltimore2018\">http://conman.fhir.org/connectathon.html?event=baltimore2018</a><br>\n2. At the login screen, click the 'Register new person' link, and enter your name there, then login to the app. No password is needed.<br>\n3. Find yourself in the 'peoples' tab (there's a filter box above the list to make it easy) then edit your entry to add contact details - especially your primary track and tracks of interest. </p>\n<p>You only need to do this once - the login details are cached in the browser cache (If you use a different browser, then you'll be able to select your name from the list - you don't need to register again).</p>\n<p>If you are hosting a server, then enter the details on the server tab (appears when any track is selected). Remember to click the 'Check CapabilityStatement' link to load the capabilityStatement which sets the FHIR version (and also shows the 'Server Capability tab'</p>\n<p>If you want to view the capabilities of an existing server, then select the 'view' link in the list and click the 'Check CapabilityStatement' link again (the CapabilityStatements are not saved in the database as they get large so need to be loaded each time)</p>\n<p>To see who in interested/participation in each track, use the 'Participation Report' tab.</p>\n<p>If there are any issues - use this chat. See you in Baltimore!</p>",
