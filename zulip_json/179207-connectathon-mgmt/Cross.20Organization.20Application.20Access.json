Here is a checklist that will help get you ready to make the most of your track time; you can refer back to this for much of the information you'll need during the event that is specific to this track:</p>\n<p>-If you are new to the track, you may wish to listen to the track overview/kick-off recording <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/548171924\">here</a> (and also at the top of the Agenda on the track page). Or you can just walk through the scenario descriptions on the track page and ask any questions on Zulip.</p>\n<p>-Obtain a UDAP certificate or generate your own. If you would like to request a complimentary certificate from EMR Direct, please register at <a href=\"http://Udap.org\">Udap.org</a>.</p>\n<p>-Add your client, server, and/or identity service to the UDAP Implementers worksheet and to \"conman\" (the results recording app, which is <a href=\"http://conman.clinfhir.com/connectathon.html?event=con27\">here</a>). There is no password for conman; just add your name to create yourself as a user. There is usually an introduction to conman at the connectathon-wide kick-off, if you haven't used it before. Or just ask!</p>\n<p>-Use the UDAP Test Tool to do offline pre-testing or test with another server listed on the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1awkXXQaeuRv5ysLo8R6f1fpfBlpTJGfSPK4xRjsai7M/edit#gid=820206691\">Implementers worksheet</a> (email <a href=\"mailto:collaborate@udap.org\">collaborate@udap.org</a> if you want to enable trust with a certificate that was not issued from the EMR Direct Test CA and we will add it).</p>\n<p>-Ask questions as you prepare and during the connectathon on Zulip at <a href=\"http://chat.fhir.org\">chat.fhir.org</a> within the <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179207-connectathon-mgmt/topic/Cross.20Organization.20Application.20Access\">track stream</a>. A participant from the January connectathon was kind enough to post a postman collection from their testing in the stream. You may also wish to ask questions to the broader group of UDAP implementers through the UDAP Google Group. </p>\n<p>-During the connectathon, for times when we don't have something scheduled simply sign up on the \"office hours\" tab of the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1awkXXQaeuRv5ysLo8R6f1fpfBlpTJGfSPK4xRjsai7M/edit#gid=820206691\">Implementers worksheet</a> with your name and a topic to plan meeting time for Q&amp;A you'd like to engage with track leads; otherwise we'll be answering Zulip inquiries but may not have the Zoom meeting active during times when we do not have anything scheduled. This is something new we're trying since I am on Pacific time and this connectathon meeting is on Central European time/GMT.</p>\n<p>-There are links to additional materials at <a href=\"http://UDAP.org\">UDAP.org</a> if you would like to research further before tomorrow. There is also a detailed slide deck from the January connectathon <a href=\"http://bit.ly/fast-security-cat26\">here</a>. The slides contain some PKI fundamentals and helpful hints for getting your JWT-based authentication working.</p>\n<p>-Please reach out if you would like to be included as a speaker (or just join us!) in the Wednesday 5/19 10am Eastern \"Collaborators\" hour; we are welcoming implementers who would like to discuss their experience with UDAP or its benefits during this time for 5-10 minutes each, give demos, or bring policy discussion. I hope this will be a useful community conversation time, especially if you are focusing on a different track but want to engage for a short time for an update on UDAP workflows or just to meet other UDAP implementers.</p>\n<p>Please reach out with any questions &amp; I look forward to connecting with you this week!</p>",

Additionally, conman seems to be more well suited for specific testing events as opposed to an ongoing deployment and availability tracker.</p>",
