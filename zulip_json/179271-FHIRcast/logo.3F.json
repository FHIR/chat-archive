Is there a high res logo file that I could get?  (soon)  Otherwise, I will try to get a screen snapshot off of the webpage.  If you haven't seen the vIAIP videos from last year, I think they are pretty darn good, although I may be bias.   Thanks.</p>",

This conversation just prompted me to try again. For branding, I usually use the color and spelling on this deck's title page: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rbw8QxYUg_l3db9S2eeCc96d9gvrMLlEzYdu7UYl2E8/edit#slide=id.g6009b6c328_0_0\">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rbw8QxYUg_l3db9S2eeCc96d9gvrMLlEzYdu7UYl2E8/edit#slide=id.g6009b6c328_0_0</a></p>",

I hate to go all corporate on you, but just to be clear, the orange color on the title page is part of the FHIRcast branding?  (and, yes, a bit of logo work might be good, lol.  I should put a student onto this task...  :)  ).</p>",
