We were discussing the FHIRCast integration of a reporting system and PACS system, and how the two systems frequently work on a \"case\" involving multiple images. It is called \"accession linking\" or \"combined results\" (in HL7 terms). The PACS usually controls the work list in this environment, and decides which imaging studies to include in the case (diagnostic report). With existing integrations, the PACS would tell us (the reporting system) to create a new report, and use accession numbers [..., ..., ...].  In this environment, we're thinking it might be appropriate to use a DiagnosticReport-Open event, which contains one or more ImagingStudy resources in its payload. By the way, the PACS may want to include old, prior studies for comparison. We are implementing a prototype that will allow for such a thing by using the \"key\" tag and specifying a value of \"PriorStudy\" as opposed to \"Study\".  Of course DiagnosticReport-Update would naturally follow allowing similar changes to accessions, addition of other things that you mention (like report contents), and possibly other pieces of structured data that could be contained in an Observation resource (like findings, measurements, etc..<br>\n). <br>\nWould love to hear comments or opinions from anyone on this subject.

It partly depends on how much one wants to overload the open operation.  I guess I'm worried about systems that try to match open/close counts exactly.</p>",
