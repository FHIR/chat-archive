Where a patient centric session would be maintained in the exam room, while many users logged in to enter data and logged out when they are done. I see a logout and a suspend event, but don't see if there is clear capability to support changing users while maintaining context like patient, episode, image, etc...  Is this a future use-case? Has it been an overlooked use-case? Or am I just not seeing how it would work?</p>",
