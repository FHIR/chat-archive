FHIRcast is balloting at maturity level \"Standard for Trial Use\". HL7 folks will read the spec here: <a href=\"https://fhircast.hl7.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://fhircast.hl7.org\">https://fhircast.hl7.org</a> and submit comments here: <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/dstucomments/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hl7.org/dstucomments/\">http://www.hl7.org/dstucomments/</a>. We'll update the specification based upon these comments and discussion around them. Once all comments are addressed, we'll update the <a href=\"https://fhircast.hl7.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://fhircast.hl7.org\">HL7 FHIRcast site</a> and will have an official and published specification!</p>\n<p>## Should I comment?<br>\nHeck yes! If you don't already have one, you should create an HL7 profile, per the <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/dstucomments/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hl7.org/dstucomments/\">instructions</a>. Of course, issues are always welcome <a href=\"https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/issues\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/issues\">on github</a> as well.</p>",
