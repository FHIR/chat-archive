The FHIRcast specification models the common webhook design pattern and specifically the W3C WebSub RFC. Since the May connectathon, we've made some significant enhancements to the open source sandbox, clarified how FHIRcast extends SMART on FHIR according to different <a href=\"http://fhircast.org/launch-scenarios/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhircast.org/launch-scenarios/\">launch scenarios</a>, as well as specifying <a href=\"http://fhircast.org/#app-requests-context-change\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhircast.org/#app-requests-context-change\">bidirectionality</a> (defining how a subscribing app requests context changes).  Our track goals were to gather additional implementer feedback on these changes.</p>\n<p><strong> Participants</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sagy Mintz - Allscripts</li>\n<li>Glenn Potter - Agfa</li>\n<li>Jeremy Richardson - M*Modal</li>\n<li>Will Maethner - Epic</li>\n<li>Bas van den Heuvel - Philips</li>\n<li>Isaac Vetter</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> Notable achievements </strong><br>\nGlenn was tested out the sandbox, including creating and validating a subscription and receiving notifications. Overall, the sandbox continues to improve and is a great tool for developers new to FHIRcast. Will worked on an Epic Hub prototype.  Jeremy Richardson began creating some <a href=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/wiki/FHIRcast-High-Level-Use-Cases\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/wiki/FHIRcast-High-Level-Use-Cases\">user stories for FHIRcast</a> - we'd love to hear your feedback.</p>\n<p>Unlike our previous connectathon, we did not identify any new issues with the sandbox!</p>\n<p><strong> Discovered issues/questions </strong><br>\nAdditionally, the group talked through some of the remaining functionality needed for a 1.0 specification that can be balloted into HL7. Over the summer, we've struggled to add websocket support as an optional feature in the specification, but made progress this weekend on a direction. Overall, we continue to refine and enhance the specification; notably,</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/issues/28\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/issues/28\">https://github.com/fhircast/docs/issues/28</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/issues/33\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/issues/33\">https://github.com/fhircast/docs/issues/33</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> What's next? </strong><br>\nThe future is bright! Next steps include:<br>\n1. Resolving the above issues.<br>\n2. Continuing to build the implementer community and respond to feedback.<br>\n3. Ballot specification into HL7.<br>\n4.
