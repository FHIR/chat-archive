Bas also provided constructive feedback on the specification ahead of our ballot. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194356\">@Will Maethner</span>  from Epic worked on his Hub implementation and successfully accepted subscriptions and communicated event notifications, and even began work on a client! </p>\n<p>Since the September connectathon, we've strengthened the specification by specifying the ability for the client to query for current context as needed, but also by designing and testing a websockets implementation. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192821\">@Martin Bellehumeur</span>  has made tremendous contributions this fall and winter in the form of his opensource javascript sandbox, Swift client, .Net client and youtube video(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHNSBg0Kn3M&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHNSBg0Kn3M&amp;feature=youtu.be\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHNSBg0Kn3M&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>). <br>\nHere's some of our in-flight or recent changes: <br>\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/pull/57\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/pull/57\">Optional support for websockets instead of web hooks</a><br>\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/pull/53\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/pull/53\">Informative description of synchronization failure considerations</a><br>\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/pull/60\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/pull/60\">Informative description of security considerations for FHIRcast implementers</a><br>\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/pull/36\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/pull/36\">Add capability for the client to query for current context</a><br>\nWe've also made a few smaller updates that clarify the specification, such as:<br>\n    - <a href=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/pull/52/files\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/pull/52/files\">Clarifying that the subscriber should respond with an HTTP 200 upon an event notification</a>.<br>\n    - Fixes some typos in the specification around the event names (<a href=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/pull/39\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fhircast/docs/pull/39\">https://github.com/fhircast/docs/pull/39</a>)</p>\n<p>Next Steps:<br>\n    - Look forward to our continued work on the experimental websockets specification. </p>\n<p>We're tentatively planning on balloting FHIRcast into HL7 this spring!</p>",
