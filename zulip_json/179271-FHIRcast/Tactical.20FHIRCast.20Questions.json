Is there something like ImagingStudy-refresh? </li>\n<li>There are occasions where a viewer would need to send a PNG image to a reporting tool like SmartReporting, MModal or PowerScribe.  Assume this is just an attachment to an observation.   Is this right?  Has anyone tried this?  Is anyone doing this type of image with a URL-based attachment a localhost hub and a web app with server-side processing?   Thoughts on pushing images through the websocket directly?  </li>\n<li>In the imaging space there are occasions where we have \"prior\" ImagingStudy resources that are in the same patient context and might contribute to a DiagnosticReport on the \"current\" ImagingStudy.   The prior would be on the same \"person\" I'm not sure of all the EMPI use cases whereby it might not be tightly referenced to the same patient.    Is there a way for one app to tell another app via FHIRCast that an additional imaging study is in context but is not the current one?</li>\n</ol>",
