I just can't find anywhere in the actual specification which <em>says</em> to use this separate endpoint.</p>\n<p>So which is correct? Should the topic be appended to <code>hub.url</code> when requesting context change? And if so, can anyone point to where in the specification this is mandated?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hey Jasper -- wow, that's a great observation. The normative language of the specification takes precedence. I believe that the <code>hub.url</code> is the address to which context requests should be made, not <code>hub.url</code>/<code>hub.topic</code>. A careful reading of <a href=\"http://fhircast.org/specification/STU2/#request-context-change\">the example in the spec</a> does show that the guid-looking path at which the context change request is made is different from previous examples of the hub.topic guid. Regardless, would you mind logging a jira issue against FHIRcast for this? As you describe, the current examples are misleading.</p>",
