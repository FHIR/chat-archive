IHE is not a core-standards organization, so it is important for HL7 to complete the core-standard first.

So there is not going to be FHIRcast testing at IHE-Connectathon. <br>\nAll the testing so far has been exploratory testing done at FHIR connectathon.<br>\nThe Imaging community (RSNA, DICOM) have been a strong stakeholder in the creation of FHIRcast. <br>\nI would expect to see some effort to demonstrate this at HIMSS, and at RSNA trade-shows.</p>",
