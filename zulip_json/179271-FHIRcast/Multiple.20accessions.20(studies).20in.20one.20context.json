        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"219204\">@Ricardo Quintano</span> Exactly, these associations as I said, could happen before or after the open-imaging event. If it were only before the event, the associated studies could simply be added to the already existing list of identifiers in the FHIR imaging study without having to change the spec. The question arises for the scenario AFTER that event.</p>\n<p>Regarding <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194452\">@Bas van den Heuvel</span> \"fhir-change\" event, I fear a generic \"change\" event (while simple and workable) may become problematic for the subscriber to handle as we consider additional use cases down the road. Would a fhir-change include EVERY change, such as new Observation data (like measurements, annotated thumbnail images, etc.)? If so, there would need to be a way for the fhir-change to specify exactly where to look in the message for the changes. I don't know - maybe that's ok.</p>\n<p>I do think it's more likely that we could have a single change-imaging-study event for the purposes of priors and associated studies (and anything else \"study-only\" related). Is there  an attribute somewhere to tag the studies in the list as \"prior\" or \"associated\"? </p>\n<p>Looking ahead, I haven't thought about observations too much yet. Maybe an \"observations-changed\" event for changes that occur during the study (from the PACS). Other observation data already known could be included in the initial open-imaging-study event.</p>\n<p>I was eventually going to open a new thread about observations in order to get people's feedback. We have our own list of observations that we'd like to consider sharing on FHIR, but maybe others have additional ones. I think it will be important to identify what these observations are, and the workflow surrounding them before we start spec'ing it out.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your feedback!</p>",
