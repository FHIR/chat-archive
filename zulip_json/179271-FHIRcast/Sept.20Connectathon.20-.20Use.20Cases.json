Is it beneficial to have something that natively works with Markdown?  I haven't successfully used Word Online or Google Docs for editing Markdown.  Maybe you have had success with this.  Google Docs is great for live collaboration.</p>\n<p>What about just working in the docs repo?<br>\nI think Confluence would be superior to the Git Wiki.</p>\n<p>I would love to have a single place to go for content.  My sense is the docs repo is the right place, if we're committed to the way <a href=\"http://fhircast.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhircast.org\">fhircast.org</a> is currently setup.</p>",
