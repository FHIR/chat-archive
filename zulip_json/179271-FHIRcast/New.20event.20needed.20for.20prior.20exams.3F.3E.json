        "content": "<p>Radiologists have been asking for a way to automatically populate their reports with prior exam information. That is, a simple text header at the top of their reports referencing the exam name, date, etc. The workflow for priors starts on the PACS - AFTER they open the image for study.  Right now FHIRCast is only being used to synchronize context (patient and study via accession). This requirement would need a new event - one that would occur after open-image-study, and would contain one or more additional studies to be interpreted by subscribers as \"priors\".</p>\n<p>There have been previous discussions in our community (somewhere) about using FHIRCast for non-context related purposes. Measurements, for example, which leads to another discussion about events for ANY kind of change in the current user session regarding Observation status. That is a another stream that I will start (or join) later. But for the purposes of this stream, I'd like to propose and get feedback on \"priors\".  If this isn't the right forum for the discussion <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191864\">@Isaac Vetter</span>  I fully understand. Just let me know.</p>\n<p>The FHIRCast spec makes a brief mention of new, custom events and goes as far as defining a naming convention (reverse url). It also says that the event catalog must list the events. Is this the extent of adding a new event? Simply naming it and adding it to the Hub's event catalogue? Or must each new event be added to the specification? </p>\n<p>Finally,  I propose a new event, call it \"prior-imaging-studies\". The FHIR context would simply be an array of Imaging Study resources. </p>\n<p>Alternatively, we can consider another workflow to before defining a new event solely for priors: This would the use case of assigning additional exams/accessions (or removing exams) from the initial list of exams contained in the open-imaging-study event. Perhaps this new event could be used for this work flow as well as the priors workflow, where each study is tagged to indicate whether it is a prior, a study to be added, or a study to be removed. Sorry if I'm interchanging the terms \"exam\" and \"study\" improperly.</p>\n<p>I realize that additional details will need to be thought through - like validation of the current patient/study context (perhaps a parameter in the payload or part of the endpoint). But for now, I'd just like to get your feedback. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194364\">@Leo Bergn√©hr</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194452\">@Bas van den Heuvel</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194356\">@Will Maethner</span>  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192821\">@Martin Bellehumeur</span></p>",

I have a couple of basic questions:<br>\n1. Are the <strong>context </strong>, <strong>key</strong>,  <strong>resource </strong>and <strong>resourcetype </strong>elements (which FHIRcast uses to contain the actual resource) defined in the FHIR spec? I couldn't find that.<br>\n2. If they are defined, is there a list of valid key names? Meaning, can we just add a new name like \"prior-study\"?</p>",
