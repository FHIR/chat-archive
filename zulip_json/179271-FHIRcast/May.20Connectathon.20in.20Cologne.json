Following implementer feedback at the January connectathon, we'd updated the spec to model a common webhook design pattern (specifically W3C's WebSub). Over the weekend, we implemented this new version of the spec and made heavy use of the excellent, <a href=\"https://github.com/fhircast/sandbox\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fhircast/sandbox\">opensource sandbox</a> (recently published by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194364\">@Leo Bergnéhr</span> and  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194360\">@Niklas Svenzén</span>  from Sectra).
