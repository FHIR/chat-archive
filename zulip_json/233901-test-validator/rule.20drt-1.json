Both Java validator and hapi server (<a href=\"https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Observation/$validate\">https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Observation/$validate</a>)<br>\nstate about 2 violated rules : drt-1 and qty-3 when examining Observation.effective.ofType(Timing).repeat.bounds.ofType(Duration).</p>\n<p><strong>drt-1 rule</strong> dictates \"There SHALL be a code if there is a value and it SHALL be an expression of time.  If system is present, it SHALL be UCUM\"<br>\nMy boundsDuration look as below , and as I understand it doesn't violates what the rule dictates. however Java validator and hapi server consider it as violation . What I'm missing here ?<br>\n&lt;effectiveTiming&gt;<br>\n        &lt;repeat&gt;<br>\n            &lt;boundsDuration&gt;<br>\n                &lt;value value=\"10\"/&gt;<br>\n                &lt;unit value=\"day\"/&gt;<br>\n                &lt;code value=\"d\"/&gt;<br>\n            &lt;/boundsDuration&gt;<br>\n        &lt;/repeat&gt;<br>\n    &lt;/effectiveTiming&gt;</p>\n<p><strong>qty-3 rule</strong><br>\nAccording to observation.sch  (schematron definition for observation )  qty-3 rule is not defined on  effectiveTiming/f:repeat/f:boundsDuration at all . So how come the rule is violated ?</p>\n<p>I would appreciate if you could enlighten me what I' missing here . <br>\nThanks , <br>\nIlia</p>",
