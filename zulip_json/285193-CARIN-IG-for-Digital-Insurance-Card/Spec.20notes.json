Furthermore there is already a Coverage.subscriber  (and subscriberId) as core data elements, so no need to repeat them in a complex extension (or any extension). Suggestion for a cleaner structure:</p>\n<p>* Define one extension called \"additionalBeneficiaries\", and allow it to repeat; it should be a valueReference(Patient), and if you want to use contained resources for the patient, that's fine. Or for this use case just populate Reference.display (since you only allow a single HumanName anyway) and Reference.identifier (for your \"memberId\" type identifer).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use top-level Coverage properties for Subscriber details.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

I don't fully understand the use case. Is this complex extensions intended to repeat to describe multiple images each of which has its own highlights, colors, etc? If so, it shouldn't define terms like \"Insurance card background color\", which would appear to be a whole-card concept.  And if not, why is it a complex extension rather than a flat collection of simple ones?</p>",

You'll see this has a lot of more of the context as well as general cleanup/clarifications that were missing from the first build.</p>\n<p>I agree with Pam's comments. CostToBeneficiary information is for the \"plan\" at large. </p>\n<p>So you are aware, we have been discussing how to simplify the extensions for beneficiaries in our public meetings. The overwhelming majority of payers involved so far see benefit in representing all the beneficiaries like they are shown on the physical insurance card in one section on the Coverage resource, but there might be a way to avoid the \"complex\" extension.</p>\n<p>No one from our team has been involved in R5 development as far as I'm aware.</p>",
