Would have been really useful on Monday of this week when I had been to the doctor and needed some quick lab work, but I didn't have my insurance card with me. When evaluating the hassle of paying out of pocket and filing the claim myself versus going home and coming back later... I went with the latter. A digital card could have saved me a trip for sure! Until this work is complete I need to at least store a picture of the card on my phone :)</p>",
