In sweden we have a solution that is based on a central registry of bookable times (correct me if I'm wrong).  Then there are the Argonaut initiatives which to me looks more like calendar bookings, but I have not seen it implemented. So it would be very interesting to see what other countries are doing in this area.</p>",
