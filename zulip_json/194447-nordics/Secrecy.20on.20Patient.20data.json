While looking at the codes, we thought that <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode/cs.html#v3-ActCode-DEMO\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode/cs.html#v3-ActCode-DEMO\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode/cs.html#v3-ActCode-DEMO</a> probably meets the Swedish requirements rather well. But you could argue that each countries secrecy flags are so unique that each country should have their own code and extend this valueSet. </p>\n<p>What happens if a person goes from Sweden to Norway, or from Denmark to Finland etc if we use the DEMO code? Is that information transferable between our countries? The meta.secrecy flag allows for multiple codes, so in theory it could include both a very specific national code, and also one common one from the existing valueSet. The problem with creating nationally unique codes is that they are not recognized in other countries, and for something like this, it feels important that a secrecy flag is in some way recongnized as it impacts patient safety. </p>\n<p>How are you planning on doing this? What are your thoughts?</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191427\">@Jens Villadsen</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192856\">@Thomas Tveit Rosenlund</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192917\">@Mikael Rinnetmäki</span></p>",

In Sweden, that would be guided by <a href=\"https://www4.skatteverket.se/rattsligvagledning/edition/2019.7/330545.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www4.skatteverket.se/rattsligvagledning/edition/2019.7/330545.html\">https://www4.skatteverket.se/rattsligvagledning/edition/2019.7/330545.html</a> and someone with a solid understanding of our laws could probably help us identify the specific law and paragraf that should be used for each country.</p>",
