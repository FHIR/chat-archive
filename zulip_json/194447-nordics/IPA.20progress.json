As you have already well documented on your page we have developed a number of national base profiles, and we are in the process now of increasing this number quite a bit. However, our base profiles are open without any use of \"must-support\" and therefore in a way somewhat different than the IPA profiles. Use of must-support will go under the umbrella of domain profiles and we still have a lot of discussion and trying out to do about the development of these - for example what is a good size and context for a domain . For now we are thinking that some will be more general (and IPA-like), while others can express quite complex reusable structures for more specific domains. As of which resources to develop here is still very much on the drawing board.</p>",
