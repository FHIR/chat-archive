Used for instance when people go to their summer house for a couple of weeks)<br>\n*Uppgiven adress (\"stated/claimed address\", used when a patient comes in whose identity can't be confirmed so no there's no official way of knowing where they live, so you just use the address they provide you with until you can verify their identity)</p>\n<p>The explanations are my own so they might not be 100% correct, but should give you an idea at least.</p>",

Some of them are going to be of great interest to the health-care sector in Norway as they need to know the prefered contact information of the person.
