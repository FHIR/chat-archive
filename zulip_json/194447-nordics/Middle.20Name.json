It would work if it was possible to have multiple Family names, so you can put a MID qualifier on one of them. But I would say it's directly incorrect to use MID on a given name for the Scandinavian/Nordic use case as it is described in the code definition below.</p>\n<p>\"MID    Middle Name Indicates that the name part is a middle name. In general, the English \"middle name\" concept is all of the given names after the first. This qualifier may be used to explicitly indicate which given names are considered to be middle names. The middle name qualifier may also be used with family names. This is a Scandinavian use case, matching the concept of \"mellomnavn\"/\"mellannamn\". There are specific rules that indicate what names may be taken as a mellannamnin different Scandinavian countries.\"</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think, should I report a Change Request for inclusion of a Middle Name extension?</strong></p>",

In the Norwegian naming law middle name is defined as a separate name type that makes the use of the naming qualifier unprecise. The naming law in Norway states that any family name can be a middle name. (Given names cannot). I guess this is a technical issue more than an actual obstacle, but in my mind the middle name is a separate entity in the naming law and should also be a separate entity in the information model, hence the separate norwegian extension for middlename as a part of the no-basis-HumanName, i still feel this is the most correct approach to define specific entities defined by national law. I would wery much appreciate further feedback regarding this reasoning.<br>\nlink to the no-basis-HumanName:  <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/HL7Norwayno-basis/NoBasisHumanName\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://simplifier.net/HL7Norwayno-basis/NoBasisHumanName\">https://simplifier.net/HL7Norwayno-basis/NoBasisHumanName</a></p>",

I dont know the details of naming in the other Nordic countries, but at least my assessment is that appending the middle name to the family name is against Swedish legal recommendations (<a href=\"https://www4.skatteverket.se/rattsligvagledning/330287.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www4.skatteverket.se/rattsligvagledning/330287.html\">https://www4.skatteverket.se/rattsligvagledning/330287.html</a>).</p>\n<p>There are potential problems when the middleName extension is not handled by a system. If that is the case, having added it to the familyName means that the family name is incorrect and there is no way to find what is a middle name or a family name, and hence I would argue it cannot be accepted, meaning there is a risk of loosing the whole patient resource instead of just the middle name. From my point of view (an EHR vendors point of view), we would not accept a risk of saving incorrect data.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the process of identifying a patient, a few things can be said about that:<br>\n1) how to identify patients is a business decision based on the available information in the hospitals system and the interaction with the patient, it doesnt really have anything to do with how you profile the patient resource<br>\n2) patient name is probably not a good way of identifying patients anyway, and the primary method for the business should be a patient identifier. As an example, different patients may have the same or similar names. There is a reason why scanning patient wristbands and id cards is the preferred identification method. </p>\n<p>Extensions is a core part of FHIR, and we cannot introduce workarounds for all extensions like this and while doing so complicating life for producers and consumers of the information.</p>",

The idea that I personally have, and that I know at least SOME people (to use Fox News rhetorics) share, is that the national basic profiles are predefined building blocks to represent solutions to profiling problems/needs that most consumers and producers in a specific FHIR context are going to have to solve. This could be for instance: <br>\n*how do I represent a national specific address <br>\n*how do I make sure my data is tagged with the country specific metadata needed to ensure the various laws can be upheld<br>\n*how do I represent the different official identifiers used in our country<br>\n*etc</p>\n<p>These profiles and extensions could then be used and extended by consumers that have a use case within the same \"affinity domain\".  In the case with the middleName we simply state that \"in the Nordic countries it's important to distinguish between the different parts of a person's name, and this is how you do it\". If you are involved in a use case where this is NOT deemed important or meaningful, then by all means, use another profile that supports your use case!</p>\n<p>If we try too hard to align all markets/communities to doing the exact same thing or representing the information in the exact same way you're removing one of the most vital cornerstone of the whole standard, clearly explained in <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility.html</a> .</p>\n<p>If that's the ambition we have, maybe we're better off trying to standardise at the point of data creation and persistation (basically solving the interoperability problem the openEHR way) and not try to do it at a later stage in the data lifecycle when it's already been created and represented in a system?</p>\n<p>Am I completely off track here?

One scenario is that there may be software that doesn’t use HumanName.text but uses a combination of HumanName.given and HumanName.family instead. A consequence is then that they will not get the middle name at all. As HumanName.text has cardinality 0…1 in the FHIR spec, that is something I think you must consider.<br>\nWhen making national profiles, I argue that it should be a strong recommendation that the name should always be as complete as possible in all scenarios. The reason for that is that the patients name is used for ensuring the identity of the patient (often together with an identifier, but sometimes on its own.)<br>\nI the Swedish group there has been discussions about whether it is our responsibility or not. From my point of view, it is absolutely the responsibly of the makers of national profiles to consider the interoperability in an international context (and in the national context as well, as there will be profiles that are not based on the national profiles) and to do all you can to ensure that vital data isn’t lost in the communication.<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span>   Do you know how other similar scenarios have been handled in other national profiles? Do you know if there are any recommendations about how you should handle HumanName.given and HumanName.family? It is not a desired behaviour of an API that new data could “pop up” in HumanName.text that you cannot find in any of the other two fields. It is quite easy to imagine a scenario where a system that does not support the nordic profile has got the complete name in HumanName.text and is forced to prop the data into a model where only two attributes are available in the form of a field for given name and another field for family name. How should they then know what to do with the middle name?<br>\nIn Sweden, the situation regarding middle name is that you weren’t allowed to have two family names. If you wanted another family name (for example if you wanted to keep our own family name and also take your spouse’s family name) you had to take that new family name as a middle name. Today the rules have changed, you can now have two family names and it is no longer allowed to take new middle names. The persons who have middle names can change them into a family name and then have two family names instead. Therefore, in Sweden, the middle name could be regarded as a kind of family name.</p>",

There aren't any limits on either the amount of given names or the amount of middle names (though middle names tend to be like a family name). For identification in the healthcare sector, you are always asked for your full name and your civil registration number in order to ensure the identity. As such, the name is not used as a single factor in identifying the individual. It is the combination of name and registration number. Omitting eg. one of the given names and eg. a middle name in the bearing information is therefore not 'dangerous'</p>",
