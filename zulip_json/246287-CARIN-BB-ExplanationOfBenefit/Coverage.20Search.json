It seems like it may be related to another issue of this IG regarding _include brought up here: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/204607-CARIN-IG.20for.20Blue.20Button.C2.AE/topic/_include.3A*\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/204607-CARIN-IG.20for.20Blue.20Button.C2.AE/topic/_include.3A*</a><br>\n_include parameters are supposed to based on search parameters (thus the additional search parameters you found in an automatically generated portion of the IG). The CARIN BB IG did not include those search parameters in the CapabilityStatement. These search parameters are really not all that helpful in the context of the use case of the IG. The _includes were added as a matter of convenience for client applications so additional logic and API calls were not needed. This has caused a bit of an incongruence in the spec that we will look to fix in STU2.</p>",
