The cardinality of the HL7 base EOB Resource for item.productOrService is 1..1 if .item is provided.  Since .item.revenue is required it means that item.productOrService must be populated.  Since the profile is not able to relax the cardinality of the resource, it is recommended payers provide a data absent reason when a CPT / HCPCS code is not available.\"</p>\n<p>I am trying to add the following instead of \"productOrService\".</p>\n<p>\"_productOrService\": {<br>\n    \"extension\": [<br>\n         { \"url\": \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/data-absent-reason\">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/data-absent-reason</a>\",<br>\n           \"valueCode\":\"unsupported\" } ]</p>\n<p>I get errors when validating (using <a href=\"https://inferno.healthit.gov/validator/\">https://inferno.healthit.gov/validator/</a>) that \"productOrService\" is required.  Should I not be putting the \"_\" in front of my property perhaps?  Perhaps there is no way to do this without getting a validation error and I don't know that I should just be looking past that particular error in this case.</p>\n<p>If we figure this out, I would love if the example in the IG (<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/ExplanationOfBenefit-InpatientEOBExample1.json.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/carin-bb/ExplanationOfBenefit-InpatientEOBExample1.json.html</a>) had at least one of the line items updated to show how this is done as it is likely a common scenario for others.</p>",
