If that is the case will there be guidance on how to scope what backend service clients have access to different PlanDefnitions or how a consumer could restrict which backend clients it wants to receive data from. Or the opposite, how a backend service client could filter out plan definitions that it did not want to send data for?    Or is this considered out of scope ?</p>",
