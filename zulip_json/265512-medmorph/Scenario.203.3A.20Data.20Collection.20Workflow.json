I see in the agenda that this scenario is related to hepatitis. I think we have sample content that could work with the eCR Now app (assuming the PlanDefinition changes we've discussed out of band are complete) in the same scenario from Chlamydia reporting. I'll have to look at the existing scenario content to see if there's a way to integrate some of the rule processing logic.</p>",
