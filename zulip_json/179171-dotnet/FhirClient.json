E.g. technique from <a href=\"https://willschenk.com/articles/2021/logging_with_an_http_proxy/\">https://willschenk.com/articles/2021/logging_with_an_http_proxy/</a></p>",

        "content": "<p>As Josh mentioned, if you are looking to understand one specific query it may be simplest to run it against something that will log the request for you.  E.g., setup an HTTP server that does nothing but log the results - the query will fail on the client, but will show you what was requested.</p>\n<p>If you are looking to understand in general how the SDK transforms search parameters, the source code is all online.  The function you want is <code>executeAsync</code> in <code>firely-net-sdk/src/Hl7.Fhir.Core/Rest/BaseFhirClient.cs</code>.  <a href=\"https://github.com/FirelyTeam/firely-net-sdk/blob/01d18262365aefcb9c38a26f80ce4ac8d4e7f4c3/src/Hl7.Fhir.Core/Rest/BaseFhirClient.cs#L960\">Here</a> is a link to the function on the <code>develop-r4</code> tree (current development for FHIR R4).  The other 'main' file I think you would be interested in is <code>firely-net-sdk/src/Hl7.Fhir.Core/Rest/SearchParamsExtensions.cs</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/FirelyTeam/firely-net-sdk/blob/develop-r4/src/Hl7.Fhir.Core/Rest/SearchParamsExtensions.cs\">link to develop-r4</a>).  This file shows some of the internal mappings for conversion of terms like <code>OrderBy</code> and <code>LimitTo</code> into the <code>SearchParams</code> equivalent.  From those entry points, you should be able to navigate through everything.</p>\n<p>Oh, one more entry point that may help (depending on what you are looking for) is looking at <code>SearchParamTests.cs</code> in the <code>fhir-net-sdk/src/Hl7.Fhir.Core.Tests/Rest</code> directory (<a href=\"https://github.com/FirelyTeam/firely-net-sdk/blob/develop-r4/src/Hl7.Fhir.Core.Tests/Rest/SearchParamsTests.cs\">develop-r4 branch link</a>).</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>",
