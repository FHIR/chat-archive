This seems to be (from a quick parsing of the code) in ValueSetExpansionExtensions.cs FindCode() as a \"==\" string compare. Is there any possibility to allow case insensitive code validation on entries to make the user's life a little easier or would that break some case specific specification?</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nStephen</p>",

In your case this is described here <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-data-absent-reason.json\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-data-absent-reason.json\">http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-data-absent-reason.json</a> and as you will see this code system is case sensitive. As such \"Unknown\" and \"unkown\" are not the same.
