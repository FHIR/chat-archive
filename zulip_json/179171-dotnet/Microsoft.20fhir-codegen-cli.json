It's on my list, but there are still a few things ahead of that.</p>\n<p>Part of the issue is determining what the code should look like - e.g., if you are generating C# code, should it interoperate with the Firely library?  I think it is more useful if it does, but it involves a bit more work up front.</p>",

Some subclasses of slices could be turned as a separate new property in the class.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What were you looking for specifically?</p>",
