The SDK itself does not have methods for the modifiers, but if you use a Firely Server Facade, Firely Server will parse the url for you and put the modifier as separate attribute in the value sent to the Filter method. This should make it easy to check for the existence as well as which modifier was added to the search.</p>",

I was wondering if there was an existing library or method(s) that handled these modifiers when supplied, like the \"And\", \"Not\"  &amp; \"Or\" methods.  Or do I need to code the predicates individually.  Based on more research I think the later.</p>",
