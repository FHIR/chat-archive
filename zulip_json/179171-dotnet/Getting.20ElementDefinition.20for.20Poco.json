        "content": "<p>Hi Patrick, no - the generated POCOs do not have the full ElementDefinitions represented as reflection attributes - only the ones necessary for (de)serialization and basic validation.  You would have to navigate through the original StructureDefinitions to do so.  There are many functions for doing so - the <code>ElementDefinitionNavigator</code> will help you represent the flat structure of the ElementDefinitions in StructureDefinition as a tree. Additionally there are <em>resolvers</em> to help you find a StructureDefinition given a canonical, e.g. the <code>ZipSource</code> (which scans the specification.zip in the Nuget package) and the <code>DirectorySource</code> (which searches through a directory on disk).</p>",
