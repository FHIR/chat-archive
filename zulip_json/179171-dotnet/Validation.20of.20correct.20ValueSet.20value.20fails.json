Everything works fine, except the validation of the type coding (Coverage.type.coding.code). It is bound to the value set <a href=\"https://simplifier.net/packages/kbv.ita.for/1.0.3/files/319342\">https://simplifier.net/packages/kbv.ita.for/1.0.3/files/319342</a>, which contains a value \"GKV\". However, when validating an object containing this code, I get the following error from the validator: [ERROR] (no details)(further diagnostics: Code 'GKV' from system '<a href=\"https://fhir.kbv.de/ValueSet/KBV_VS_FOR_Payor_type\">https://fhir.kbv.de/ValueSet/KBV_VS_FOR_Payor_type</a>' does not exist in valueset '<a href=\"https://fhir.kbv.de/ValueSet/KBV_VS_FOR_Payor_type\">https://fhir.kbv.de/ValueSet/KBV_VS_FOR_Payor_type</a>') (at Bundle.entry[4].resource[0].type[0])<br>\nI added all the required profiles to a folder and used a DirectorySource and a CachedResolver to resolve the profiles. I also included the value set in this folder. Do I need to do anything else for the value sets to be successfully validated?</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nAshwani Mehlem</p>",
