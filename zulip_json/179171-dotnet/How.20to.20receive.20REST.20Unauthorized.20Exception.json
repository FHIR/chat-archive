(Parameter 'key')\" instead of the expected authorization exception. Looking at the stack trace, the exception originates in the parsing subroutines. This is surprising, since the REST operation would have failed with a 401 error (which I've confirmed with Postman), so I don't know why the result is sent through for parsing. Is it possible that my FhirClient settings, which are permissive, are leading to this behavior? Obviously, I'd prefer to get the proper Authorization exception so I can provide the appropriate error message to the user and launch the process of getting a new token.</p>",

The fact that this is raises an ArgumentNullException means that you've found a bug in the handling here - something is happening that we are not expecting to happen, so we'd need to debug this.
