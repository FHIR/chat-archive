I would point out that this is the only item I know of that is converted from one form to another in the serialization round trip. My personal view is that should not occur. I would like to preserve the resource in the form it was provided. Perhaps to shine a different light on it, would it be acceptable that observation values were converted up or down the unit scale on serialization round-tripping, say Liters (L) are converted correctly to Milliliters (ml)?</p>",
