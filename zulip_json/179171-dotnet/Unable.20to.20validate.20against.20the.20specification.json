The obstacle to validating turned out to be the presence of conflicting NuGet packages for Newtonsoft.Json and System.ValueTuple; the Fhir packages depended on different versions than the code base I was working with.  </p>\n<p>These conflicts presented as warnings rather than build errors.  I made the error of discounting the importance of these warnings.  </p>\n<p>When I took the time to address these conflicts, the validation worked just fine.</p>",
