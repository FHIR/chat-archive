So i basically need to load the patients data from the Fhir Server and generate my output for my frontend.</p>\n<p>As far as i know the Endpoints of a Fhir Server are always the same  =&gt; baseURL, resourceName and resourceParameters. (in General)<br>\nSo i would like to have on my own dotnetcore Backend the  functions to call these endpoints. I dont know if i mix something in my head and should just write my own functions to call the FhirServer API with the FhirClient() on my own.</p>\n<p>I hope you understand what i was trying to explain</p>\n<p>Thanks so far for you help!</p>",
