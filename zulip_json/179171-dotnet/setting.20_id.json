I think searching the identifier class to locate things when they have a unique id in the real world is too slow.</p>",

AWS doesn't allow Id to set _id with client.create and client.update, with no resource already present, kicks out.  I've asked AWS support if they have an option to allow updates when the resource is not present - - no answer, don't know why I'm paying them if their support is so poor.  I can't believe this is a problem that is new to them.  C# should be such a basic thing talking to them  I don't understand what is going on.</p>",

If you can't set _id on a POST (by definition) and you can't set it on a PUT (because the server is not coded to do it) , you've got a problem setting the unique ids  you want to use to efficiently search for resources i.e. _id is defined in FHIR for a really valid purpose.</p>",

The technical id will be visible on requests for the resource on the URL, and also in the references to that resource. This could potentially leak identifiable/sensitive data about the person. You can use the identifier field within Patient/Practitioner/etc for storing that government assigned id, so it will be better protected. You may need to do a search on that identifier to be able to retrieve the data later on, but that's a minor inconvenience when compared to leaking sensitive data.</p>",
