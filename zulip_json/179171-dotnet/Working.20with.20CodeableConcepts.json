My understanding is that a MedicationStatement resource can contain either a Medication resource reference or a CodeableConcept in the medication[x] attribute. In the SDK, the MedicationStatement.Medication property is polymorphic.  When it's a CodeableConcept, I'm having trouble getting the Code object from the Medication property on the MedicationStatement object.  Is there a pattern or idiom you're supposed to use?  When debugging, I can see the Code object as a member, but I can seem to get to it.  Any code samples to help?</p>",
