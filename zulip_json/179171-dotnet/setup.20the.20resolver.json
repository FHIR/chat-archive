Visual Studio <em>should</em> copy this file to the binary output folder, but sometimes fails to do so. In that case, select specification.zip in your solution explorer, go to properties tab and change the file type to \"Content\", \"Copy to output when newer\". This ensures that VS actually includes the ZIP file in the output folder. Now the ZipSource should be able to resolve.</p>",
