I've seen a couple of implementations done with Node.Js (<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bobby-brennan/fhir-swagger\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bobby-brennan/fhir-swagger\">https://github.com/bobby-brennan/fhir-swagger</a>) plus OpenMRS have somehow made their own implementation (<a href=\"https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/FHIR+Swagger+Document+generator+and+enhancements\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/FHIR+Swagger+Document+generator+and+enhancements\">https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/FHIR+Swagger+Document+generator+and+enhancements</a>). Swagger-Net works very well with normal Web API services, however, FHIR is a bit different since you have to write something that reads the CapabilityStatement (STU3) and creates an interface based on it.</p>\n<p>If someone is looking to do the same, I'd be glad to hear from you.</p>",
