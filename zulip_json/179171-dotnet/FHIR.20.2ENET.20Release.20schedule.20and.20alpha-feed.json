At the moment we release 1.0.0-final, we will also release a 1.1-beta</li>\n<li>Six weeks later, we will release 1.1 final, and release 1.2-beta, etcetera.</li>\n<li>This way we have 6 weeks to catch blocking issues and create hotfixes before we release the final version.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to these beta and final releases, we now have an alpha-feed containing the NuGets built from each merged PR. This means that if you donate a PR and we pull it, you will have an alpha-build with your fix ready in about 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>Of course, this would contain other alpha-level features too, so be aware. You can find this alpha-feed here: <a href=\"https://www.myget.org/F/fhir-net-api/api/v3/index.json\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.myget.org/F/fhir-net-api/api/v3/index.json\">https://www.myget.org/F/fhir-net-api/api/v3/index.json</a>.  As you can see, we keep alpha releases out of the main NuGet repository, so we do not confuse users that are not interested in alpha-level releases.</p>",
