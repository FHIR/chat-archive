I am currently building the FHIR bundle in C# code using this library and am trying to figure out how to build the race part of the patient demographics. I am looking for an example of how to build  Hl7.Fhir.Model.Patient with the race extension such as: </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>{\n            &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://fhir.org/guides/argonaut/StructureDefinition/argo-race&quot;,\n            &quot;extension&quot;: [\n              {\n                &quot;url&quot;: &quot;ombCategory&quot;,\n                &quot;valueCoding&quot;: {\n                  &quot;system&quot;: &quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/Race&quot;,\n                  &quot;code&quot;: &quot;2106-3&quot;,\n                  &quot;display&quot;: &quot;White&quot;,\n                  &quot;userSelected&quot;: false\n                }\n              },\n              {\n                &quot;url&quot;: &quot;text&quot;,\n                &quot;valueString&quot;: &quot;White&quot;\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Any help is appreciated. <br>\nAlso, if there is a better way to transform CDA to FHIR than doing it in code I would be interested in knowing about it. It seems like a common scenario and would like to know what others are doing using the dotnet impl. <br>\nThanks.<br>\nMiguel.</p>",
