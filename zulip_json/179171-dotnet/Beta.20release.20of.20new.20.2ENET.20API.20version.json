I'd love you to test it out before I remove the \"beta\" moniker.</p>\n<p>The most important changes are bug fixes to the FhirClient (it sometimes still acted as a DSTU2 client), performance improvements of about 20% to the validator (thanks Brian P!) and the introduction of 'async' for the FhirClient (thanks Ricardo!)</p>\n<p>Find the full list of changes here: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/ewoutkramer/8a066ccd7727cd6f5cd2282ae9b9a1d7\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/ewoutkramer/8a066ccd7727cd6f5cd2282ae9b9a1d7\">https://gist.github.com/ewoutkramer/8a066ccd7727cd6f5cd2282ae9b9a1d7</a></p>",
