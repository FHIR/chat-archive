As a database provider, this is just not as well supported as some of the others like SQL Server, etc. Does anyone else have experience setting this up successfully? If so we'd love to hear more. Wondering if there are any folks from Microsoft that can weigh in as well.</p>\n<p>Consider the following thread, which seems to be going round and round about licensing issues: <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/forums/html/topic?id=9a107d00-d814-440c-b438-faa4d020ae1a&amp;ps=25\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/forums/html/topic?id=9a107d00-d814-440c-b438-faa4d020ae1a&amp;ps=25\">https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/forums/html/topic?id=9a107d00-d814-440c-b438-faa4d020ae1a&amp;ps=25</a></p>",
