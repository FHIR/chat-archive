In general, the difference is that if your pattern contains e.g. a CodeableConcept with just one code, it would match a CodeableConcept with multiple (as long as your code matches one of those codes), and it would also match a CodeableConcept that in addition has \"text\", even when your pattern does not have text.  Much like \"Query by Example\" (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_by_Example\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_by_Example\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_by_Example</a>)</p>",
