It is technically possible to convert STU3 datatype and resource structure definitions to DSTU2 format and subsequently load these into Forge. The authored profiles can then be converted back to STU3 format. However this is quite involved and we only support this for Forge customers with a service level agreement.<br>\nWe will upgrade all our tooling (FHIR .NET API, Forge, Simplifier, Spark) after the official publication of STU3.</p>",

Can we add those two attributes as extension in DSTU2 profile? or do we have any other work around?</p>",
