The binding is set to the canonical URL of your ValueSet resource. The validator will lookup that resource by URL when it wants to validate an instance. So if your ValueSet contents have changed, it will validate against the new codes.<br>\nOf course you will have to be careful with changing the ValueSet after you have published your profile,  since that might break existing implementations if the binding is set to 'required'.</p>",
