        "content": "<p>Good morning!  I have had various people asking about R5 builds of the C# API.  Building myself isn't too troublesome, but building what people want is harder... Release builds require signing, so I need to either strip off code-signing or put in my own key, and Debug doesn't output the NuGet files.  Was wondering if there could be a <code>develop-r5</code> or <code>nightly</code> branch added with an automated build process (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure Pipeline, etc.).<br>\nHappy to help if there's interest but not bandwidth to do it, but thought I'd try for 'official' before building out something separate.<br>\nThanks!</p>",

Maybe I can automate this with Azure Pipelines. <br>\nSo keep an eye on our releases.<br>\nHappy holidays!</p>",
