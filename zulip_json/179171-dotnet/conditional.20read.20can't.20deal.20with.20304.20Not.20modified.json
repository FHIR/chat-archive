If so, they SHALL accept either a 304 Not Modified as a valid status code on the response (which means that the content is unchanged since that date) or full content (either the content has changed, or the server does not support conditional request). </p>\n<p>The exception thrown by the Fhirclient is: \"Server returned a status code 'NotModified', which is not supported by the FhirClient\".<br>\nBased on the spec, that seems wrong.</p>\n<p>In a more general sense, it would be good that any error in the 300 and 400 ranges is always returned to the caller in a more transparant way.</p>",
