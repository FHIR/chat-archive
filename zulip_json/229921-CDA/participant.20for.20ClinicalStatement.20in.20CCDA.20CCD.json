Both result organizer and Observation component can have Author (CCDA R2.1 spec) but they do not define any linking to participant, product, specimen participation classes. </p>\n<p>So, does it mean that CCD does not allow to use these elements defined in CDA but not part of CCD section definition? </p>\n<p>Looking for some help on this. Thanks.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"195623\">@daniel venton</span></p>",
