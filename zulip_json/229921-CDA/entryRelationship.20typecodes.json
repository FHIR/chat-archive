        "content": "<p>Hello everyone. <br>\nWe are currently working on a wound summary for chronic wounds. These wounds might be a recurrent wound. We want to be able to link the current wound to an older wound for which we might add additional information like healing duration or procedures performed. We already figured out that we should add an id to the wound which we modeled as an act. Now we want link the act to another act using <code>entryRelationship</code>, but I am a little unsure about the typecode to use. <br>\nWe had a look at <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/standards/vocabulary/vocabulary_tables/infrastructure/vocabulary/vs_ActRelationshipType.html#x_ActRelationshipEntryRelationship\">https://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/standards/vocabulary/vocabulary_tables/infrastructure/vocabulary/vs_ActRelationshipType.html#x_ActRelationshipEntryRelationship</a>, but I don't think that any of the proposed codes fits to our use case. When I had a look at the underlying code system (<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/standards/vocabulary/vocabulary_tables/infrastructure/vocabulary/ActRelationshipType.html\">https://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/standards/vocabulary/vocabulary_tables/infrastructure/vocabulary/ActRelationshipType.html</a>), I thought the code <code>PREV</code> would fit very well, but it is not part of the ValueSet.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196115\">@Mareike Przysucha</span> Here is an example construction linking a concern to a problem that is an entry in another section: <a href=\"https://cdasearch.hl7.org/examples/view/Health%20Concerns/Health%20Concerns%20Link%20to%20Problems%20Section\">https://cdasearch.hl7.org/examples/view/Health%20Concerns/Health%20Concerns%20Link%20to%20Problems%20Section</a> This uses the generic REFR and an an Act with the same ID as the target (here an observation ). I was a bit surprised to see the same id reused in two different acts, but in this context it is clear that this act is just a reference (like externalAct in the example below). You could use the act.code of the \"referencing act\" to indicate more details on this relationship. </p>\n<p>Here is another example, this time using reference and externalAct <a href=\"http://cdasearch.hl7.org/examples/view/6fa91e8f-225d-4f4c-a18b-dbc7193b10b0\">http://cdasearch.hl7.org/examples/view/6fa91e8f-225d-4f4c-a18b-dbc7193b10b0</a> Usually, the externalAct would point to something in another document.</p>",
