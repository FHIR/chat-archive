Here's the session description:  Track 3: API Standards and Innovation<br>\nFHIR Endpoint Discovery and Monitoring<br>\nFHIR servers are proliferating across the nation, making health data more readily available for application developers and consumers. This session will feature perspectives on FHIR endpoint discovery and monitoring from several industry stakeholders. It will also debut the \"Lantern\" system, being used to monitor the availability and adoption of FHIR API service-based URLs by select users across the U.S</p>",

Acting as _the_ centralized endpoint directory was not the original intent of Lantern, but as of right now it does seem to be the only location where an aggregation of vendor-published lists can be gathered. <br>\nThe big challenge faced by lantern right now is that there are only 2 small publicly available vendor lists to pull from at the moment.
