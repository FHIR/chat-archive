I am setting up a FHIR server to handle such a request, but how do I know the workflow of the client? Is it standard practice for the client application to know that it needs to first lookup/create a patient, then use that patient in a DeviceRequest? Does the server need to implement search features for patients knowing that the reference to the patient will be needed, or is the workflow to require the developers of each application to just work closely with each other to identify what the needs of each would be?</p>",

If the implementing FHIR server does not store encounters in the FHIR resource sense, but instead uses the information in other ways, can/should a \"contained\" reference be used for the encounter? Once again, does this decision need to be agreed upon by the client and server applications, or is this information something that can be gleamed from the capability statement?</p>",
