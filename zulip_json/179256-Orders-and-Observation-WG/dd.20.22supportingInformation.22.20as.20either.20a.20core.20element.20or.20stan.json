In genomics, this can include family history, other observations about the patient and literature references.</code></p>\n<p>Why not the in DR.conclusion as free text? You could add an extension of supportinginformation.  I would propose adding new context DR.conclusion to  <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/communicationrequest-supportingInfo\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/communicationrequest-supportingInfo\">http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/communicationrequest-supportingInfo</a>:</p>",

(If all they needed was text blob, they could just embed it in narrative).  I think it should be a separate extension because the meaning is different.  request-supporting info is \"additional information provided as part of the request to support the execution of the request\".  This would be \"additional information gathered as part of the execution of the event that may be helpful in interpreting the results of the event\".  Also, I think it should live under DR directly - it's not extending the conclusion.</p>",
