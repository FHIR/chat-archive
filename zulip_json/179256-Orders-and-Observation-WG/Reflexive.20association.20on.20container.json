What is the appetite for dropping the requirement for 'direct'? </p>\n<p>We could better represent this as a reflexive containment, so adding container.container, but I can't recall any reflexive/self-associations in FHIR other than via a Resource. Has this been a deliberate choice? I recognise that this would make constraints on level of nesting difficult.</p>",
