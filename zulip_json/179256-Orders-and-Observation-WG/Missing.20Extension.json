This was for event-researchStudy.  It was in the ballot #2 list: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/extension-event-researchstudy.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/extension-event-researchstudy.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/2018Sep/extension-event-researchstudy.html</a>   but the link listed on that page for its future home gives a 404 error.  Was this implemented?  If not, could it be implemented (soon)?</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"216135\">@Douglas Denney</span>  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196523\">@Hugh Glover</span></p>",
