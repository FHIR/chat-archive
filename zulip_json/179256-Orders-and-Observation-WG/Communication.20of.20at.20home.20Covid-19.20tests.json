Looking at the companies that provide these tests, they seem to provide web interfaces with communication of results with the patient. Is there a use case/need for standardized communication from these companies direct to EHRs (handled appropriately) should a patient provide the needed permission? Would EHRs even be willing to manage such incoming messages/data?</p>",
