The DPC will have at least a provider and a procedure in the header, and a list of items for the procedure.  See an example here (<a href=\"https://app.prefcards.com/r/b745fda2-c957-49be-bc7a-fe41bada759c\">https://app.prefcards.com/r/b745fda2-c957-49be-bc7a-fe41bada759c</a>)</p>\n<p>In the above thread, we were referred to the InventoryReport resource.  Our organization may not accept a resource that isn't in the FHIR 4.0.1 spec.</p>\n<p>We are evaluating:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Using a FHIR List resource</li>\n<li>Using a FHIR Group resource</li>\n<li>Build a custom resource based on the FHIR basic resource.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Does anybody in the community have any experience related to this or any additional insight?  Thank you!</p>",
