I went through the documentation in the past few days but I wasn't able to figure out what resource is the one that represents the LabOrder in FHIR. I considered the resource ProcedureRequest but looks like it doesn't fit exactly what I need because it says: \"The ProcedureRequest resource allows requesting only a single procedure\". Anyone can help me with this? Thanks</p>",

If you tried to suspend a whole requisition, you'd have to independently request suspension of each test - and might succeed on some and fail on others.  In the end, we decided that having a business object for the overall requisition wasn't useful.</p>",
