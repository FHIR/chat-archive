But as much as we understand it is not possible to sort by code-values of a specific code-system if there are codes multiple code-systems given in an observation. Secondly, the catalog may change over time which would mean that observations would have to be updated. This is definitely not not what we want to do. Moreover, it does not feel right to include the sort order information into the resource.</p>\n<p>Is there any \"way to go\" in FHIR for using such a kind of sort order for resources?</p>",
