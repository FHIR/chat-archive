That clarification made me however wonder whether <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/vitals/2020Sep/StructureDefinition-VitalSignsPanel.html#tabs-diff\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/vitals/2020Sep/StructureDefinition-VitalSignsPanel.html#tabs-diff</a> is correct. All Observation.hasMember slices show a cardinality of \"1..*. Doesn't that mean that they have to be present? [Note that this is a new comment, now that it is clear that all panel members are optional]</p>",
