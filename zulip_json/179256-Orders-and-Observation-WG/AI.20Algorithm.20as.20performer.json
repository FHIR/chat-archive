Do you have any suggestions how to resolve this?</p>",

We have to consider that the performer is about responsibility, while the device is not.  The device was used to create the result.  The analogy with Lab would be very informative to consider where the analyzer does not become a performer.  The medical director would be documented as such.  The question is therefore for AI software as to who the medical provider is who owns managing and maintaining the software that yielded the results, ensure calibration, etc., etc. and when the results are inaccurate is held accountable.  Whether an organization or person, that is the .performer.  All else is a .device.</p>",
