        "content": "<p>As part of it's mandate of \"encourage consistency across resources\", the FHIR-I workflow project has begun work on developing a 'product' pattern by looking at some of the more stable 'thing' resources and identifying areas of consistency across them - which could result in a pattern of the same nature as the event, request and definition patterns.   Jose shared the work that OO has already done on resource relationships, but we didn't see anything that had yet been done at the element level, so hopefully there's no overlap in effort.  We wanted to share what we're doing so there can be collaboration between the two groups.
