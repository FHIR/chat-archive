Besides the actual value we also receive a reference range and an interpretation code with respect to the reference range. <br>\nNow, the legacy lab software had a 'feature' that marked questionable measurements specificyally. I.e. a value with reference range and interpretation was transmitted, but at the same time the lab software wants to say: \"dear user, please take care when using this value, due to wrong calibration the value may be false\". </p>\n<p>My reasoning would be to use Observation.interpretation, extend the current ValueSet by a value let's say \"questionable\" and let our frontend application mark those values specifically whenever this special interpretation code is present. </p>\n<p>Another idea was to use 2 Observation.interpretation codes (field has cardinality 0..*). In my eyes this does not make too much sense, since the value should not be used anyway as long it is \"not reliable\". So any given reference range (such as normal, above threshold etc) is irrelevant. </p>\n<p>I'd be happy to receive your thoughts in this. <br>\nThanks, Alexander</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hmm.  I think this one deserves some further analysis and thought before we make a decision.  My thought at the moment is that adding a \"questionable\" (or similar) code to observation-interpretation isn't really the best choice.  We've spent a lot of time and have harmonized the observation interpretation codes across all of the V2, V3/CDA and FHIR standard families.  I think that the notion of interpretation has the underlying assumption that you have data that is considered to be reasonably reliable that you can interpret.  That the data itself is unreliable is definitely an exceptional case.  There is certainly precedent for including codes for some exceptional cases in value sets, so I don't know that we can or should exclude that possibility entirely.  But <strong>if</strong> we would add a code to the value set for this, I think it might be better to make that code more specific, such as \"unable to interpret due to inadequate data quality\" (I grant that could be a bit too verbose, but something like that).  Or instead, the interpretation code could simply be omitted in this case and the concern about the data quality and the reason for no interpretation would be conveyed in the note (which I think would likely be my preference).  I think this needs further discussion in the OO WG (or maybe reconvene the observation interpretation OO subgroup) to consider and propose what we think will be the best solution.</p>",

As soon as you propose a new value for the codeset we could switch to that 'official' value.
