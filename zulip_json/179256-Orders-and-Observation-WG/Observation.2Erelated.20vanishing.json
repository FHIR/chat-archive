        "content": "<p>Its probably late to get in on this discussion but have been locked out of FHIR work for a while. There is a proposed change to 'simplify' the Observation.related element to two inline elements that are more narrowly defined. Previously, the Observation.related element could point to one of at least two resources, another Observation and the Questionnaire. In the PHD Implementation Guide, the use of this element was critical in order to link the 'current' Observation to what is known as the 'Coincident Time Stamp Observation' and any other Observation linked by what 11073 20601 calls the 'Source-Handle-Reference'.<br>\nThe former is an Observation which contains information about the PHD time stamp and how it was corrected (if it needed to be corrected) and whether or not the time stamp is provided by the PHD or the time of reception (among other details). Given that PHDs tend to have unsynchronized time clocks, correct ion is frequent and the Coincident Time Stamp Observation is essential. The VA in the US was adamant on this topic. The source-handle-reference points to another Observation that this Observation is somehow associated with. An example is the activity 'Session'  Observation in activity monitors which scopes Observations like heart rates, calories burned, speed, intensity, etc. contained within that session. Or meal and carb consumption information associated with Glucose measurements.<br>\nThe proposed solution, as understood from its description, is semantically inconsistent with the current usage. The Observation pointed to in the Observation.reference is really 'derivedFrom' the current Observation, and not the reverse.<br>\nContinua thinks it is much better to start with the Observation and find all items associated with it (the Device, Patient, Coincident Time Stamp, etc) than have to do the reverse.</p>\n<p>Is our understanding of this change correct? If it is still semantically consistent in the new interpretation to point to these related Observations in the new version as the old, we are happy. But note, in the Continua usage, the Observation.related value is derived from the current Observation, and not the reverse!</p>",

Also note that a coincident time stamp pair will typically have a lot of \".derivedFrom\" referenced observations, since a coincident time stamp is only generated when there is a relevant change in the device time / clock. To me this use of .derivedFrom seems to stretch the semantics: the coincident time stamp is not derived from the set of observations that need it. It is a related observation that is essential to interpret the original observation fully. A similar reasoning would hold for the source-handle-reference mapping.<br>\nWhen .related is replaced by .derivedFrom and .hasMember, the semantically correct way to map IEEE 11073 PHD observations would be to use the .hasMember reference for the coincident time stamp and source-handle-reference observations,  while still having a Observation.value[x]. This looks OK to me, but contradicts the described intended use of Observation.hasMember.
