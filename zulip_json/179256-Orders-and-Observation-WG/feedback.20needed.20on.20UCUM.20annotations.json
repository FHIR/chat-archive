We would like to know the implementer ramifications either way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is it just the cost of using UCUM to recognize that the stuff inside the curly braces is for human consumption and bake that into your codebase?</li>\n<li>Would it break your system?</li>\n<li>Would interoperability be impacted either way?</li>\n</ul>",
