Then if there's growth, there'd be an organism identified (or similar named) result with a value of the organism (encoded with SCT organism code) per PH/ELR requirements.  I would not expect a yes no response.  <br>\nIf a MRSA pcr screening test were performed, then I'd expect LOINC <a href=\"https://loinc.org/35492-8/\">https://loinc.org/35492-8/</a>   with detected/not detected (or similar results as indicated on the IVD vendor's package insert to be CLIA compliant) is reported.   (again simple lab structure or order-result-value ).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Regarding structure, LISs where these lab data most often originate usually have separate data dictionaries for orders and results where these test terms are built and coded.   Values may be in another dictionary, while organisms are usually in yet another.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not sure what you mean by organisms tests pointing to their isolates.  An organism is an isolate (a colony on a culture plate is isolated and identified as to which organism it is).  Are you indicating tests performed on an isolate should point to it, then yes agree.  A gram pos susceptibility panel order could be ordered on Org A, while a Gram neg susceptibility panel could be ordered on Org B. Results need to be kept on the respective organism from a quality and patient safety issue (and avoiding error).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If it is a MRSA screening pCR test, results reported differ from a culture in that the organism isn't \"identified\" per se and thus no SCT organism codes would be used (and the test is rarely performed on an isolate, but rather the collected specimen).</p>",
