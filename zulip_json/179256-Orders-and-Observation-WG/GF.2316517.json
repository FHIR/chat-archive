        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191401\">@Eric Haas</span> ,  I absolutely agree that BodySite and Specimen must remain separate.  I find it quite strange, however, that the Observation.subject is the person of record (aka the patient), for two reasons (1) the word \"subject\" usually refers to the target of the investigation, and (2) because the subject can be Reference(Patient | Group | Device | Location). <br>\nSuppose the observation involves a location associated with the patient, and the observation is 285117005 | Noisy environment (environment) I think the tendency of users would be to put the location in the subject since you are making the observation about the location. But if they do this, there is no association with a patient -- there is nothing in Location that allows association with patient. <br>\nPerhaps we should document that the subject is ALWAYS THE PATIENT whose record contains the observation, if there is a PATIENT at all, regardless of whether the observation actually observes the patient? That's a pretty bizarre definition of \"subject\".  I'd call that \"patient\". A much more straightforward way approach would be to have Observation.patient[OfRecord], and Observation.focus. Then if there is an observation about the patient's home, both would be filled in. If there is an observation about a hospital ward, then only the latter. But Observation.patient would always be a PATIENT.  Less confusing, at least to me.</p>",
