It happens that _none_ of the values in that value set suit the interpretations of Karnofsky Performance Status (the values in LOINC LL4986-7). <br>\n1) Is it acceptable to bind to a value set that includes the interpretations from LL4986-7?  (I expect yes, since the original binding is extensible)<br>\n2) Is it acceptable to _exclude_ the inappropriate codes from ObservationInterpretation from the profiled binding? Even if _all_ the original codes are inappropriate?</p>",
