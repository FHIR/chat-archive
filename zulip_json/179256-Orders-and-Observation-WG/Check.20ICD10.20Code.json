Following that, the question to answer is does the terminology server (or servers) that you are using support the ICD-10 variants (and the applicable versions) that you need?  If terminology server support isn't currently available (as is the case presently for the \"base\" WHO ICD-10, as far as I've seen) then it can be added.  And once the terminology server support is available then any particular ICD-10 code can be validated using ValuuSet/$validate-code (or if you are using R4 then also CodeSystem/$validate-code is available, if that's appropriate for what you need).</p>",
