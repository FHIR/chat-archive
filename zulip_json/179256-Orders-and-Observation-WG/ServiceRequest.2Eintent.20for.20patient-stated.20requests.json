The code system for intent seems to include a number of aspects: who is making the request, what the requester is authorizing, who is ensuring any activity is performed, etc. The intent seems to be more than a plan and less than a directive. More than a plan since the patient authorizes an assessment of the condition, less than a directive since it is not a \"legally binding instruction\". Any thoughts?  I did not find examples of the resource being used for this use case.</p>",
