FHIR specification translation is a big work, at least for me. The most difficult part for me was to update and maintain current version of translation for the CI current build. So, it can be more convenient to choose the latest stable official version and translate it as it will not be changed over time, and there will be no need to merge new English version with previous translated version.<br>\nAnother thing is where to build the specification. We have been hosting our site with FHIR translation on Github Pages and build it on Travis but now there is a problem with building the specification (There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue). So, I asked <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191315\">@Josh Mandel</span> about moving our FHIR spec translation builds to your CI <a href=\"https://dev.azure.com/fhir-build/build.fhir.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://dev.azure.com/fhir-build/build.fhir.org\">https://dev.azure.com/fhir-build/build.fhir.org</a>.</p>",

I copied the <code>source</code> folder, named the copy <code>source.ru</code>, and translated files in this folder leaving original English text in HTML comments. This is done to make it easier for future merges with new versions of specification. When I run a build, the content of <code>source.ru</code> substitutes <code>source</code> folder, and the site is built in Russian. Some files from folders <code>implementations</code>, <code>tools</code> also need translation e.g. <code>PageProcessor.java</code>, <code>Publisher.java</code>. The condition in <code>PageProcessor.java</code> should be changed to allow translated titles  (line <code>log(\"file \\\"\"+filename+\"\\\": div/div[\"+Integer.toString(doc.getChildNodes().indexOf(x))+\"]/h2 must be either 'Scope and Usage', 'Boundaries and Relationships', or 'Background and Context'\"</code>).</p>",

And about 200 <code>*.html</code> files in the root of the <code>source</code> folder, some of them very large e.g. <code>search.html</code>, <code>http.html</code>. For me, it took almost a year.</p>",
