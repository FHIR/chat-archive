Weâ€™ve been looking at <a href=\"http://simplifier.net\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://simplifier.net\">simplifier.net</a>, but it has a rather high license fee. Do you see a point in coordinating how to do this within the Nordic countries, for example by using similar or the same solution?</p>",

If you can render the profiles yourself and don't need the fancy parts of simplifier, a regular git-repo will do it for you. And for national use, a single profile can be enough ... but that utterly depends on what the need is</p>",
