The v2-to-FHIR project hasn't discussed tasks much (the mapping you may have seen in the ORM message map) hasn't been completed yet (there is no MSH to Task map yet). I suspect it's a hold over from an earlier Zulip discussion we've had <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179188-v2-to-FHIR/topic/task.20vs.20message.20header\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179188-v2-to-FHIR/topic/task.20vs.20message.20header</a> where you proposed a receiver responsibility Task be created. This is probably something we should come back to.</p>",
