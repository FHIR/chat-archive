        "content": "<p>As you may recall, some time ago we reviewed mapping output from mapping tools with the original HL7 v2 message used to determine whether the output reflected the intent.  That lead to quite a number of updates to mapping definitions ranging from further comments, better conditions, as well as changes to the target FHIR resource/attribute, or additional mappings.  The goal is not only to enhance the mapping definitions and the respective mapping tools that contributed, but to arrive a sample v2 messages for which we have agreed to FHIR output that correctly represents that to aid developers as they interpret the mapping definitions.</p>\n<p>We plan to start that again second half of October and invite implementers to share sample v2 test messages representing actual messages for test patients for ADT^A01^ADT_A01, ADT^A04^ADT_A04, ORM^O01^ORM_O01, OML^O21^OML_O21, ORU^R01^ORU_R01, VXU^V04^VXU_V04, and SIU^S12^SIU_S12, and/or the mapped output according to the mapping definitions.  For now we are tracking the sample v2 messages and generated output here: <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/OO/v2+Sample+Messages\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/OO/v2+Sample+Messages</a>.  If you have any questions, please let us know.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>",
