While generally that is agreed to start with that, the question is what to do when FHIR does not want to increase the cardinality as, e.g., it may not fit within the 80-20 rule.<br>\nOne proposed is to (a) add an extension to support the repititions 2 and up or (b) to not map and let the implementation figure out whether they may need an extension.</p>\n<p>We seek feedback on which approach to take.</p>",
