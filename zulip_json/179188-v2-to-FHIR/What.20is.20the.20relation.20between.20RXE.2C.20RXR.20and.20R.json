As <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191832\">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span> mentioned above, RXO has what is originally ordered by a physician. It can be included for comparison with what is encoded by a pharmacist. </p>\n<p>Your sample message is likely an inpatient medication order (one time Furosemide IV) that was placed by a provider (in ORC-12) and has now been verified (\"encoded\") by the pharmacy (ORC-13) and is being sent to a dispensing system. The administration route is Intravenous as shown in RXR-1. </p>\n<p>HL7 v2 allows multiple RXR's for alternatives of admin route/site/method combination, and that's probably why the corresponding cardinality in the v2-to-FHIR mapping is 1...*. Though, I personally have never seen an encoded order with multiple RXR's.</p>",

This RXO structure allows the encoded order to include a \"copy\" of the original order from the prescriber.  The second RXR is with the required RXE.  This is the pharmacy's instantiation of the prescriber's order.  So the first RXR, if present, is the route the prescriber requested and the second RXR is the route the pharmacy is using.</p>\n<p>In our (old) implementation, we never included the RXO structure in RDE messages.</p>\n<p>As in John's example, multiple routes could be allowed by the prescriber and then constrained either by the pharmacy or at administration.  Another simplistic example is when a topical product is being applied to multiple parts of the body - the route code would be the same but the site would be different.</p>",
