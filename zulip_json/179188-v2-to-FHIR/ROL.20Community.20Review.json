        "content": "<p>Today we are starting the first Community Review of the ROL segment.  Note that ROL is mapped differently based on the role and different locations in a message.  The mappings ready for review are the use of ROL under PID/PD1 that either uses RelatedPerson or PractitionerRole, and the use of ROL under PV1/PV2 using PractionerRole, : ROL[PID/PD1 – RelatedPerson] - <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11aEEi0skCde4ANez6cvm75IFqi2cTaVtUc2MJvnDlpY/edit#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11aEEi0skCde4ANez6cvm75IFqi2cTaVtUc2MJvnDlpY/edit#gid=0\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11aEEi0skCde4ANez6cvm75IFqi2cTaVtUc2MJvnDlpY/edit#gid=0</a> , ROL[PID/PD1 – PractitionerRole] - <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k_CXL1pI4XSfDj93bYImERZ_fm5Cwm9tzQj_IKHBAeI/edit#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k_CXL1pI4XSfDj93bYImERZ_fm5Cwm9tzQj_IKHBAeI/edit#gid=0\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k_CXL1pI4XSfDj93bYImERZ_fm5Cwm9tzQj_IKHBAeI/edit#gid=0</a>, ROL[PV1/PV2 – PractitionerRole] - <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17J53J2VmqnNff7s3Yi2RQceWvdy6vagJTTsQo7kxuG0/edit#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17J53J2VmqnNff7s3Yi2RQceWvdy6vagJTTsQo7kxuG0/edit#gid=0\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17J53J2VmqnNff7s3Yi2RQceWvdy6vagJTTsQo7kxuG0/edit#gid=0</a>.</p>\n<p>This is NOT a ballot, rather the first opportunity to get wider input into the completeness and correctness of the proposed mapping.  The intent is to solicit any comments to:</p>\n<p>•   Validate any mappings starting at the segment level, as well as for the referenced data types, which in turn may reference further data types, i.e., column F and onwards.<br>\no   Note that if the Condition cell is empty, that mapping is always meant to occur.<br>\no   Note that if a v2 field is included multiple times with different conditions, any condition that is true results in the subsequent mapping.  We left the Derived Mapping column in for now, but that is expected to be removed once we are comfortable this approach works.<br>\n•   Identify segment fields that may not be mapped to a FHIR attribute, but you are using, so there should be a mapping.</p>\n<p>Comments and suggested updates should be entered in the spreadsheet against the cell to which they apply (select the cell and click on the + icon in the short cut bar).  We appreciate to include in your comment the problem (if the cell is not blank) and a proposed solution/wording.</p>\n<p>The deadline for your comments is July 28 as on July 29 we start to review the comments during our project team meetings.</p>\n<p>Any questions, please contact Craig and/or myself.</p>",
