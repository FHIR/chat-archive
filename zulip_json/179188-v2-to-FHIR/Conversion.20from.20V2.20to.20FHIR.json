When i send message the source connector is receiving and transforming it into patient resource. I am getting the empty resource at the destination. I have to do mappings or is any other method. If i do mappings it is difficult to map all the variables in fhir resource builder(FHIR SENDER).<br>\nThank You,</p>",
