I see that there is a Coverage resource but I can't find a way to link that resource to my <code>ProcedureRequest</code>. Anyone can point me in the right direction? thanks</p>",

I'm guessing your desire is to say \"bill this insurance for this procedure/test\", and I think the FHIR current build of <code>ServiceRequest</code> solves that. <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/servicerequest.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/servicerequest.html\">http://build.fhir.org/servicerequest.html</a></p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194031\">@Nick Hatt</span> In v2 the reference is made explicitly since the insurance information can be sent together with the order. It is possible to specify <code>IN1</code>,<code> IN2</code> and <code>IN3</code> as part of the document <code>ORM_O01</code> when the order is sent to the laboratories. As you mention, I can see that the reference to coverage is included in the current construction. which is very desirable. I am using the STU3 version now and maybe using <code>bundles</code> I can achieve what I want until the next stable version is available. thanks for your help</p>",
