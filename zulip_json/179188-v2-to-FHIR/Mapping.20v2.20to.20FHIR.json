Example may be the living will indicator are student indicators that have limited use, but when used have to be consistent.  Another example is to maintain original meaning where FHIR opted to go to a required code, whereas v2 has more granular capabilities with CWEs.<br>\n3) it is very unique to v2 construct that you would never use in FHIR - IG extension  Example: OBX-4  needs to be preserved in FHIR as the mapper may not have enough knowledge about OBX-4 syntax to know how to structure the relationships (the true destination does).</p>\n<p>I'm not aware of anybody using FHIR as an immediate intermediary for v2 to v2 messages, but you never know what somebody does when they use v2 to FHIR, persist it is some form, and then include the data again in a v2 message.  All bets are off on that one.</p>\n<p>But with the above, it is clear that every gap between what is actually used in v2 (keep in mind, we are not mapping just the full standard, only those elements that are known to be used in production somewhere) needs to go through the above triage and then worked out with the resource owner whether it is worthy of 1), 2), or 3).</p>",
