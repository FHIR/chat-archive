The intent is to solicit any comments to:<br>\n• Validate any mappings starting at the message level, as well as for the referenced segments or data types, which in turn may reference further data types<br>\no Note that if the Condition cell is empty, that mapping is always meant to occur.<br>\n• Identify segments that may not be mapped to a FHIR resource, but you are using, so there should be a mapping.</p>\n<p>Comments and suggested updates should be entered in the spreadsheet against the cell to which they apply (select the cell and click on the + icon in the short cut bar). We appreciate to include in your comment the problem (if the cell is not blank) and a proposed solution/wording.</p>\n<p>The deadline for your comments is December 23.</p>\n<p>Any questions, please contact Hans and/or myself.</p>",
