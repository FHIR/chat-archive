I just wanted something in the main windowe, but then found a specific discussion on V2 to FHIR.<br>\nI'm trying to understand FHIR in the context of having a tone of HL7 v2 experience.  Is anybody willing to chat with me or answer a few one-off questions about how a FHIR implementation might look, in comparison to accomplishing the same thing with V2? Thank you.</p>",

If that's the scope you're interested in, you're welcome to join our regular calls (we meet this Thursday at 11AM Eastern. If you're more interested in lab related workflows (suggest by the thread title), then the OO on FHIR calls on Tuesday afternoons at 2PM Eastern might be your best bet. All of these calls (including Zoom links if you are logged into your HL7 account) are listed on the HL7 Conference Call Center at  <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/concalls/Default.aspx\">https://www.hl7.org/concalls/Default.aspx</a>. Note that next week is HL7's Working Group Meeting, so many of the regularly scheduled calls won't be happen (and a lot of the calls aren't scheduled yet for the weeks after that (but they should continue as normal).</p>",
