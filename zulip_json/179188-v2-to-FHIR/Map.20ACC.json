There, it might be just about capturing accidental information, like Patient getting admitted after an accident. In such cases, there is no Claim resource, its just plan accident information. So, ACC shall be able to map to FHIR without claims data. Observation profile seems the only answer as of now. I found this profile- <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/vrdr/2019May/InjuryIncident.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/vrdr/2019May/InjuryIncident.html</a>. Though, this does not provide mapping of all ACC data to FHIR Observation resource but gives input on how one can proceed using Observation.
