As per GDoc, there is a field (event - :\"+MSG.1+\"^\"+MSG.2\") which is mapped with Provennace.activity.coding.display. However, as the datatype is CodeableConcept, so we can map it to Provenance.activity.text instead of using coding.display (as there is no coding.code mapped).<br>\nPlease share your thoughts.<br>\nThanks</p>",
