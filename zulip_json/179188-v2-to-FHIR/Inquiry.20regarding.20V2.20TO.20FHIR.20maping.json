I want to just confirm it that should such type model is available or not.</p>\n<p>I understand that some people are working in this area, but I assume that there is no middle ware engine available and people are working to map specific resources from their own develop framework not through common framework. Am I right? Please advise me in this regard.</p>\n<p>I would be so thankful, if he or she can share information with me through my email ( [mohd.ayazkn@gmail.com]<br>\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Ayaz, PhD Student<br>\nEmail: [mohd.ayazkn@gmail.com]</p>\n</blockquote>",

So far we have worked on proof of concept mappings of a few of the more common v2 message types (ADT, orders, results, vaccinations). There are a few translation engines being developed.  Please have a look at the project and see if that helps.</p>",
