        "content": "<p>During today's call the topic of DTM to dateTime or date or instant were discussed.  One of the suggestions was not to use a mapping spreadsheet for each of the DTM mappings, but rather to provide general guidance along the following lines while treating DTM as a primitive data type.  \"Use ISO 8601 to establish the re-formatting from HL7 v2 data type DTM to the applicable HL7 FHIR data type.  We note that platform date/time mapping utilities are available from datetime to date, etc. that are best used, thus not requiring specific v2-to-FHIR data type mapping spreadsheets.\"  This can be further augmented with references to various sources that provider the necessary guidance for each platform.  Is that a reasonable approach, or is there a preference to continue to use mapping spreadsheets like these ones: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10wRv0wvBZpI8RckFACDvhjE1JnhbQPyWKilFOTyE6zc/edit#gid=0\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10wRv0wvBZpI8RckFACDvhjE1JnhbQPyWKilFOTyE6zc/edit#gid=0</a>; <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fFYomFpUpUXNvzd06dDj22vsENV51Tclv-Z1NuVooFA/edit#gid=0\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fFYomFpUpUXNvzd06dDj22vsENV51Tclv-Z1NuVooFA/edit#gid=0</a>.</p>",
