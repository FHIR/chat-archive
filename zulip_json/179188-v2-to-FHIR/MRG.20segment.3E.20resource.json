I think the process for FHIR merges is still in discussion (another Zulip thread pointed to <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PA/Merge+Operation\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/PA/Merge+Operation</a>). If merge operation is the right way to go we would have to map to that which is something, I'm not sure the current mapping process is ready for. Sorry we're not more help.</p>",
