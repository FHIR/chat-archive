You're not looking at an attested report, you're looking at a simple question/answer pair - and Observation is more than sufficient for that.  Agree that multiple Observations are probably better than a single QuestionnaireResponse because the former are more computable.  As for Bundle, you could certainly send a transaction and ask to record all of the data.  However, if some/all of the Observations are intrinsically tied to the ServiceRequest and have no relevance or independent existence outside the ServiceRequest, you could just 'contain' them in the ServiceRequest.</p>",
