Text in red in columns B through E represent proposed use in general, and if proposed extensions, their general characteristics.  Columns F onward represent the proposed profile definition for each of the spreadsheet types we currently require.  The proposal is to use four profiles against ConceptMap, even though some are very similar, just to keep the context simple.  The proposal is also that one ConceptMap instance would be representative of one spreadsheet that you can find in the master list referenced above.</p>\n<p>To visualize further, an example for the PID segment (some of the fields) is available here:  <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/download/attachments/20022006/ConceptMap%20Mapping%20Example.json?api=v2\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/download/attachments/20022006/ConceptMap%20Mapping%20Example.json?api=v2\">https://confluence.hl7.org/download/attachments/20022006/ConceptMap%20Mapping%20Example.json?api=v2</a>.  Note that necessary escape characters, commas, and other formatting may not be computable yet, but the intent was to get an idea what it would look like, not have it perfect yet.</p>\n<p>Please review and use this thread to make suggestions on making the proposal implementable, or argue why something else would be better to provide the core representation.  Note that we will continue with spreadsheets as the main format to develop and review the mappings.</p>",

So our use case - a mapping table with N columns - is a bit of a stretch, and needs extensions. We have discussed the pros and cons of using several extensions, roughly one for each column, versus one generic extension for any new column.</p>\n<p>Irrespective of this decision, we will need a tool to generate a ConceptMap from a Google sheet. This tool is pretty easy to write, and I suggest that it should give each ConceptMap instance a narrative section which is an html table - just like the source mapping sheet. This is easy to do.</p>",
