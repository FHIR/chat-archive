We can treat \"v2 to FHIR\" like CDS Hooks, FHIRPath and a few other specifications that (according to the TSC) are not part of the FHIR product family, but which (according to the community and with FMG blessing) are treated as though they are and are subject to FMG rules and handled using the FHIR tracker.  We could then define V2-to-FHIR as a \"FHIR\" specification and things will work swimmingly starting now.</p>\n<p>Or - we can say that this is a spec that really does belong in the v2 product family and just leave issues submitted in the FHIR tracker as un-triaged (and unresolvable) until such time as the V2 tracker is up, at which point the items can be 'moved' to the proper tracker (which will change all of their keys).  </p>\n<p>The delay in getting the v2 tracker up is that we've made a bunch of changes - some as recently as last week - to better allow migration of content from JiraDev to HL7 Jira production, as well as some changes that allow for multiple feedback trackers - one per family.  Those changes haven't been well tested yet and we didn't want to migrate them into production until they'd been tested a bit.  As well, we've learned from experience that making any significant changes to tracker behavior is not a great idea when a ballot has just closed, there's a WGM right away and co-chairs are trying to get all of their ballot results imported.  That's what drove my assertion of 'late October'.  If we feel we can safely do it sooner than that, we will.</p>",
