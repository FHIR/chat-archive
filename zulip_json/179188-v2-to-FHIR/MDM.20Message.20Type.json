That  original v2 message could (should) be decomposed into more discrete FHIR Resources like DiagnosticReport, Observation, etc... All of those FHIR Resources should be pointed at by a Provenance.target, with Provenance.entity pointing at the DocumentReference that points at a Binary that holds the original v2 message. This would be the most formal and complete. Lesser solutions can be done too.  (Note the same is true if a CDA is imported and decomposed, and also a FHIR Document... really anything that is imported and decomposed into FHIR Resources where the original imported object needs to be maintained with Provenance and metadata.</p>",
