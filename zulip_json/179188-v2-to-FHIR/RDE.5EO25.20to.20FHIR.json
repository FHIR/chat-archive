As per hl7, RDE^25 replicates the standard RDE message with a different trigger event code to indicate the specific use case of a refill authorization request. Considering this, mapping would remain exactly same as that of the RDE^O11 with different intent. But I am not able to see intent \"refill\" on FHIR side. Any guidance on how to proceed with the mappings is highly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Also RXE.16, RXE.17 and RXE.18 provides details of refill, but unsure about where this information can be mapped on FHIR side as MedicationRequest do not have any designated fields for refill request. Rather just have numberOfRepeatsAllowed which is mapped with RXE.12(Number Of Refills)</p>",

The medication dispense is the result of a pharmacy system responding to a medication order. I am not sure if it a right choice to map it with MedicationDespense.<br>\nAlso, how shall we notify that it is a Refill request in MedicationDespense?</p>",
