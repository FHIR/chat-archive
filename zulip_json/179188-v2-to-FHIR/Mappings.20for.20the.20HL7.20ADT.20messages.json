This is intended to yield a \"definitive\" mapping from an HL7 perspective on what V2 elements should be mapped to what FHIR elements, and as appropriate, create FHIR extensions to accommodate elements in V2 that are not in FHIR Core, but are known to be used in V2 messages.  Anybody interested to join that effort, for notifications on meetings/etc., you can sign up to <a href=\"mailto:v2-to-fhir@lists.hl7.org\" title=\"mailto:v2-to-fhir@lists.hl7.org\">v2-to-fhir@lists.hl7.org</a>.  Additional discussions can happen on this zulip stream as well.</p>",
