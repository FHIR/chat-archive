The intent is to solicit any comments to:<br>\n• Validate any mappings starting at the segment level, as well as for the referenced data types, which in turn may reference further data types, and vocabulary <br>\n• Validate fields that you may be using but are not mapped.</p>\n<p>Comments and suggested updates should be entered in the spreadsheet against the cell to which they apply (select the cell and click on the + icon in the short cut bar). We appreciate to include in your comment the problem (if the cell is not blank) and a proposed solution/wording.</p>\n<p>The deadline for your comments is June 22.</p>\n<p>Any questions, please contact Hans and/or myself.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>",
