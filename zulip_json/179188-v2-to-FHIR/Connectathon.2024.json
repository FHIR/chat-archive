That is why you see subject reference Patient/64bac34e-e611-3549-848b-89416176aa0b.<br>\nAs part of conversion, we generate new resource ids. These resource ids are GUIDs, but not random. These are generated using generateUUID helper function that takes an input parameter and outputs GUID. For a given input, the output is always the same. By default, we use the PID.3.1 as input to generate the GUID.<br>\nIf you want to retain the PID.3.1 as the resource id, you can modify the template from ‘ID=(generateUUID PID-3-1)’ to ‘ID= PID-3-1’. Note that you will also need to modify all the references from ‘REF=(concat 'Patient/' (generateUUID PID-3-1))' to ‘REF=(concat 'Patient/' PID-3-1)’*</p>",
