The base definition is vague and there are no suggested values in table 0018, so it's difficult to know how any given implementation has interpreted it. I could see it contributing to either Encounter. type or .class but the exact meaning may vary from implementation to implementation. The v2-to-FHIR project has mapped a number of different messages and segments and there's not always a singular mapping and sometimes it has to be an implementation specific decision.</p>",
