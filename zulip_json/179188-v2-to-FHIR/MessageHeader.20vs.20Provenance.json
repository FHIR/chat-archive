Right now, I am mapping one v2 message to 1 provenance record - and many v2 messages to 1 messageheader when MSH is the same except timestamp (same trigger, location, etc). This way MSHs to MessageHeader have 1 resource for the same hl7 feed. This avoids redundancy in having a provenance resource for every hl7 message AND a messageheader resource for every hl7 message.</p>",

If the receiving end doesn't support messaging at all, why would you create a MessageHeader resource? Provenance is probably sufficient. Mostly we see one provenance per v2-source message. One Provenance for a v2-stream would seem to be rather abstract, but again in your context it may be sufficient.</p>",

We are also doing one provenance per v2 message, and then one MessageHeader for v2-stream, but doesn't seem very valuable as you mentioned. Thanks!</p>",
