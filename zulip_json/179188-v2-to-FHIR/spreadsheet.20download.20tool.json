I think we should avoid using spaces or slashes in the names of tables/types/segments, etc. To make sure we can link things together in automation, we will have to generate file names from these type/segment names and slashes and spaces should be converted. If we don't have them in the first place, there is less ambiguity. So for instance, \"Yes/No\" is not a great name. <br>\n2. HL70136 and HL70532 are in the same file. I think for consistency, they should be broken into separate sheets. <br>\n3. The sheet for EI[udiCarrierDI] is not accessible (at least not for me).<br>\n4. HD[XON.8 should be HD[XON.8]<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"193818\">@robert worden</span> , could you give it a go and see if you can pull the latest version of the tool and get all the sheets.</p>",
