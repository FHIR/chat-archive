This fall/autumn we have a student project that is going to demonstrate how the Immunization community might move from HL7 v2 to FHIR. This project is going to convert a \"reference implementation\" that supports HL7 v2 into FHIR. I am going to use resources from this v2-to-fhir project to give examples the students can use. I'll use the time here at the Connectathon to prepare these messages and give feedback. I'm looking forward to working with all of you!</p>",

It is currently supporting a simple set of R4 resources (Patient, ImagingStudy, DiagnosticReport, ServiceRequest..etc) for read-only consumption, plus simple search operations.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>",
