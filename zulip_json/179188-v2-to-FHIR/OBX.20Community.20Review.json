        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191783\">@Daya Sharma</span> : We are actually mapping to the cumulative versions, starting with v2.8.2 (soon v2.9 once published), but then include everything that was deprecated as well using the last definition for the element at the time it was deprecated.  Therefore, if you are trying to map a v2.3.1, or a v.2.8.2, everything present would map as intended.  Clearly, in a v2.3.1 something may be a CE and now a CWE, or an ID and now a CNE, etc.  But since those updates were all backwards compatible, the positions in the message still are effectively the same when present.  For the name/descriptions we do use the latest, e.g., Interpretation rather than Abnormal Flags in OBX, but again, that is not changing the mapping based on the version one starts with.  For Vocabulary that works as well as we do not re-use codes and their meaning, so if deprecated, a new one should not be created with the same code but different meaning.</p>\n<p>In the case you are seeing, Casistix provided the information on v2.7.  Since that time we went up to v2.8.2 (current publication), and v2.9 is about to be published.  If you only work with v2.7 at the moment, you can ignore OBX-27 onwards and check whether the mappings up to then still work.</p>",
