Sure, the mapping of data elements from FHIR resources to v2 segments has its challenges, but bridging the gap between messaging and REST turns out to be rather tricky as well. At the very least you'd have to have some fancy event-detection mechanism based on the (ultimate) source of the data. Most 'mapping solutions' (whether commercial or not) don't offer anything when it comes to mapping the fundamental differences in exchange paradigms.</p>",
