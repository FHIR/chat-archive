        "content": "<p>During the May 2021 Connectathon 28 event, a new element was approved and implemented for the r5 TestScript resource - the TestScript.scope element. An HL7 FHIR JIRA ticket <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-32689\">FHIR-32689</a> was introduced since then to expand the set of codes used by the scope.conformance element. This original expansion added the 'recommended' code as follows:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Code</th>\n<th>Display</th>\n<th>Definition</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>required</td>\n<td>Required</td>\n<td>All tests are expected to pass. This is the default value.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>optional</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>All tests are expected to pass but non-pass statuses may be allowed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>recommended</td>\n<td>Recommended</td>\n<td>All tests are expected to pass but warning statuses may be allowed.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<p>During a recent FHIR-I WG Monday call, this JIRA was reviewed and the proposed change was updated to the following:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Code</th>\n<th>Display</th>\n<th>Definition</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>required</td>\n<td>Required</td>\n<td>All tests are expected to pass. Warning statuses are permitted. This is the default value.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>optional</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>All tests are expected to pass but non-pass statuses may be allowed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>strict</td>\n<td>Strict</td>\n<td>All tests are expected to pass. Warnings are treated as a failure.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<p>FHIR-I has requested feedback from the FHIR community on this proposed updated change before approving this JIRA issue. Please let us know if these updated codes are well defined or if they may require additional refinement.</p>",
