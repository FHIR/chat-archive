With that, mCODE (at least for the September 2019 ballot) has aligned with US centric profiles (either Argonaut or US Core as preference).  Would that still be okay with you and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191451\">@Patrick Werner</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194075\">@Halina Labikova</span> ?  I'm sure we would consider international support at some point, but unfortunately not for this September.</p>",
