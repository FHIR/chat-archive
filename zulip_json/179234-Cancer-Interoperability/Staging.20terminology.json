I thought it might help the discussion to show what is currently in there and what the problems with AJCC staging in SNOMED are. If it's cluttering the folder, feel free to delete, it was something I had amalgamated a while ago so I thought why not share.</p>\n<p>I guess what stands out is that the AJCC edition isn't included. This is circumvented by making the FSN of the concept the actual narrative definition of the concept, which I feel doesn't quite fit in SNOMED (which tends to leave narrative definitions out) and medical vocabulary desiderata.</p>",
