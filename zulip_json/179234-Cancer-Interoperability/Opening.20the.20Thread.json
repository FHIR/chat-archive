The group would be collaborative across all medical specialties associated with Diagnoses and Treatment, including Imaging, Pathology, Oncology, Genomics and Surgery.  We have only had two meetings so-far, so it's very early days.  But we have close to thirty individuals and two dozen organizations.  So there is quite a bit of interest.</p>",
