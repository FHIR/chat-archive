Continuing the Montreal Thursday lunch followup.... thanks for meeting with Lloyd and BrianP regarding whether the notion of a Tumor Board should be a Procedure or Encounter FHIR resource - current position:  Tumor Board activities are an Encounter.  Sorry Stefan!  :-) .  Also, another fortuitous opportunity from Thursday lunch...additional interest from <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194075\">@Halina Labikova</span> (Varian) and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191436\">@Stefan Lang</span> in participating in an mCODE FHIR Connectathon Track in Atlanta this September.  We also have early support from Marty Madeira (AJCC) on using a cancer staging test set for prostate cancer curated from the AJCC API for Connectathon use cases.  Next steps on Connectathon work - I will create a first draft of the actors, system roles, and use case scenarios for this track and advertise to the masses for participation in a couple of weeks.  .... we have great interest and traction on doing this.  Let's keep up the momentum!  cc: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191447\">@Mark Kramer</span></p>",
