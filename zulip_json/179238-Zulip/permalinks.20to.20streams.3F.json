I'm guessing that these stream urls are intended to be permalinks and they all changed as part of the server migration that we did for zulip a while back, is that right? (17 and 179159 feel a lot like auto-generated SQL id primary keys). </p>\n<p>If not, is there  a different or better way to get a permalink to a stream?</p>",
