Looking at settings for web-public streams (screenshot below), the \"Allow creating\" checkbox is disabled (i.e., I cannot turn the feature on). It would be great to try this feature as a way to offer a better user experience than <a href=\"https://chat-archive.fhir.org\">https://chat-archive.fhir.org</a>. Is there a setting in the hosting config that needs to be flipped for us, or am I misunderstanding the instructions at <a href=\"https://zulip.com/help/web-public-streams#enable-or-disable-web-public-streams\">https://zulip.com/help/web-public-streams#enable-or-disable-web-public-streams</a> ?</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/P2hcGYBsMrdZC5I3l5kRQEZt/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/P2hcGYBsMrdZC5I3l5kRQEZt/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/P2hcGYBsMrdZC5I3l5kRQEZt/image.png\"></a></div>",
