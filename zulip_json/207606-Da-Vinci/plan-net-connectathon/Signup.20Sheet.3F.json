The limit gets enforced only when a request attempt to go beyond the 30000th resource.  This is put in place for performance &amp; also to limit \"bot attacks\" trying to capture the entire data by paginating through millions of resources.  Does \"includes information for all active providers\" really means the api have to support providing the complete provider list  with the same request through pagination?  It seems like the rule is not that precise.  I am still wondering what use case will this solve.</p>",
