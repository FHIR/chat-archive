I think there is a misunderstanding of \"required\" vs \"Must Support\".<br>\nTruly required is minimum cardinality of &gt;=1.<br>\nMust support with a minimum cardinality of 0 means (for a server) if you have it you must provide it, and (for a client) if you receive an instance that includes this element, you have to handle it gracefully.<br>\n  Location</p>\n<p>- partOf is MS 0..1 (\"Another Location this one is physically a part of\") --&gt;  not relevant for our example<br>\n  -  endpoint is MS 0..* --&gt; we don't have any so we can't provide 'em.</p>",
