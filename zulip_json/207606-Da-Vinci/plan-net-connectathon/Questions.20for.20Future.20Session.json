This may be due to a business need to support fellowship-specific certifications as specialties, reflect ASAM levels of care, meet state-specific Medicaid requirements for provider directories, or any of a number of other reasons.  Are there plans for the specialty codeset for the Davinci PDEX Plan Net IG to be extensible beyond NUCC?  If not, should we consider crosswalking our clients' non-NUCC specialties for exposure via<br>\n the HealthcareService profile instead?  Is there perhaps an even better approach that we could explore?</p>",

Payers also recognize other credentials that are not specialties.. The NUCC does not support identifying these credentials as a specialty. </p>\n<p>Speaking as someone who participated in the IG development, I know the FHIR IG is capable of capturing these other credentials through Practitioner qualifications. The value set in Healthcareservice.type is extensible and Healthcareserivce.characteristic is available for additional characteristics about the provider when not available elsewhere. </p>\n<p>If the state Medicaids believe there are gaps in the code set, they should be working with the Medicaid representatives to the NUCC to submit requests for consideration. Specialties are not programs or services. </p>\n<p>Speaking with my BCBSA payer hat on, we use taxonomy codes across our system and the current code set is sufficient for Blue Plan provider data.</p>",

We recognize the NUCC taxonomy as a mature codeset, and I am not trying to lobby here for its expansion.  It sounds our best bet is to extend the HealthcareService elements as needed.  Has there been any discussion among the IG authors regarding additional organization or standardization of HealthcareService categories or types?  FYI, I plan to join the Working Group sessions in a couple of weeks if this is a better topic for that group.</p>",
