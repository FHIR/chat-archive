E.g. changing a dose, adding a coverage, adding a link to a clinical trial.  The specification should make explicit that clients should detect this and manage the resulting collision - ideally by 'merging' the related updates.  The client will also have to handle merging (or more likely regenerating) narrative to reflect the union of the accepted changes.</p>\n<p>Also see: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/17-cds-hooks/subject/Collisions.20from.20multiple.20updates\" title=\"#narrow/stream/17-cds-hooks/subject/Collisions.20from.20multiple.20updates\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/17-cds-hooks/subject/Collisions.20from.20multiple.20updates</a></p>\n</blockquote>",

There will be cases where service A runs before service B and they could conflict on the same field. Would it be better to provide the entire existing resource with changes applied in the update, or just the id/version and the updated fields? Does the first one win, and the second must be re-run? A similar issue may happen with concurrent EMR updates.</p>\n<p>It seems to me this may be integration specific, but it would be good to at least discuss it in the spec and provide any best practices. I have the feeling that merging narratives are not really possible in any sane way without significant specialized integration work.</p>\n</blockquote>",

One possibility is that as soon as a user selects an update, you rerun all of the services, so they're starting from a new set of cards that are based on the new version.</p>\n</blockquote>",
