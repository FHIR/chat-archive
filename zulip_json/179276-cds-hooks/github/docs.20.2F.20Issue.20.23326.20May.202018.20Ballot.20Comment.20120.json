Where different authorities handle a different vector. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>https://healthcaresecprivacy.blogspot.com/2018/02/apple-should-have-heart.html\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>That said, i is not likely that scopes are going to be completely powerful on-their-own. Some further rule enforcement might need to be done at the RS based on information the RS knows. This is generally how consents and safety are being handled when they are complex.   --- So, we should not look to scopes as the ONLY access control mechanism. </p>\n</blockquote>",
