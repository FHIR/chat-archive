This is important to provide a consistent user experience. Yet, some amount of minimal markup is important for the CDS service to provide to enable a clinician to rapidly understand data visually.  Visual representation of data is important to translate data to users -- it seems important that the markup functionality support tables. Further, a card's detail must be treated as non-executable code (not html, javascript, etc), for security reasons. </p>\n<p>Considered approaches:<br>\n* <a href=\"http://spec.commonmark.org/0.5/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://spec.commonmark.org/0.5/\">CommonMark</a> without html support - doesn't support tables.<br>\n* FHIR-defined xhtml data type - <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/narrative.html#xhtml\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/narrative.html#xhtml\">xhtml</a><br>\n* <a href=\"https://github.github.com/gfm/#what-is-github-flavored-markdown-\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.github.com/gfm/#what-is-github-flavored-markdown-\">GitHub flavored markdown</a>, which is CommonMark+tables, no html, </p>\n<p>The joint goals of data visualization -- including tables, and security -- outlawing html, land us squarely on GitHub Flavored markdown. </p>\n<p>I'm going to write up a PR for GitHub Flavored markdown to be in the spec as the support markup method in CDS Hooks responses' detail element.</p>\n</blockquote>",
