A CDS Service SHOULD reject a request containing a JWT with an _exp_ value greater than now.<br>\n2) Use the jti / nonce field. A CDS Service SHOULD reject a request containing a _jti_ that has been previously used by the EHR.<br>\n3) Perhaps even reject requests with an old iat. A CDS Service MAY reject a request containing a _iat_ older than 8 minutes.<br>\n4) Verify that the public key used to sign the JWT is valid. A CDS Service SHOULD verify that the public key used to sign the JWT exists within the JWK set at the location identified by the jku and is identified by the kid. </p>\n<p>Is this worthwhile? What am I missing?</p>\n<p>In a brief conversation with @kpshek , he pointed out that this type of guidance may be best placed in an implementation guide and not in the spec. </p>\n</blockquote>",
