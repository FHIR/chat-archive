For example, the EHR could allow users to dismiss a card so that it no longer appears, ignoring any suggestions on the card.  There is currently no mechanism in the CDS-hook spec that allows for the EHR to notify the CDS service that such an action has taken place.</p>\n<p>The existing CDS-Hooks specification provides suggestion with only a label to describe them to the consuming EMR. However it is very common to have different types of suggestions which may be displayed or utilized differently by the EMR. Other than ‘accept’ suggestions which may add, remove, or modify the order, it is useful to capture the reasons a user decided not to accept the suggested changes. </p>\n<p>Please consider adding a Suggestion.type required field with values of ‘accept’, ‘override’, ‘prompt’, ‘dismiss’:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>accept</strong> - for suggestions which are considered accepting the requested changes</li>\n<li><strong>override</strong> - for suggestions where there is a reason for not accepting changes</li>\n<li><strong>prompt</strong> - For override reasons where the user should be prompted for additional information (the prompt would be part of the label). For analytics postback, the text entered by the user should be included in the POST body</li>\n<li><strong>dismiss</strong> - The default reason, which would be called if the user closes the card display or otherwise dismisses it without selecting a suggestion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The suggestions structure with these changes might look similar to the following:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>  &quot;suggestions&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;dismiss&quot;,\n      &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Dismiss&quot;,\n      &quot;uuid&quot;: &quot;27b525a4-71d7-4b01-b796-294178da5544&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;accept&quot;,\n      &quot;actions&quot;: [\n        {\n          &quot;type&quot;: &quot;delete&quot;,\n          &quot;resource&quot;: &quot;DiagnosticOrder/117262&quot;\n        }\n      ],\n      &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Remove Orders&quot;,\n      &quot;uuid&quot;: &quot;b0fefb6a-406b-4efb-b416-29a88118a066&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;override&quot;,\n      &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Rapid eye movement sleep disorders&quot;,\n      &quot;uuid&quot;: &quot;f0a30281-d0cd-4eff-b105-d9a47c2ce324&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;prompt&quot;,\n      &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Other (please specify)&quot;,\n      &quot;uuid&quot;: &quot;1e770724-3342-4b5c-802b-cc3e48880e44&quot;\n    }\n  ]\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>A 'prompt' type suggestion analytic post might include a body of the form:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>{\n  &quot;response&quot;: &quot;End-of-life care&quot;\n}\n</pre></div>\n\n\n</blockquote>",
