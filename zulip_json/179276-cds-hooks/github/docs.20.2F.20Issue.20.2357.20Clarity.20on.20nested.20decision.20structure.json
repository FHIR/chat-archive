I think the questions you pose here are further indication that the decisions feature needs quite a bit of further thought, implementation feedback, and documentation.</p>\n<p>We will swing back on the decisions feature on a subsequent release. As such, I'm closing this issue with a _deferred_ label.</p>\n</blockquote>",
