However wouldn't that also potentially impact the fields/etc in the discovery endpoint?  Do you see mixing versions of cds hooks (ie 2 services, 1 with hooks v1 and another with hooks v2)? If not, perhaps it should at the same level as \"services\". This should probably also align with how to represent the FHIR version that the service supports - #3.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Not great since it ties you to a particular url, but it's not terrible since it's unlikely that others will be storing the URL in a large number of places.<br>\n2. add <code>cds-hooks-version</code> to the cds-service definition.  Also not great because you need to parse the definition in order to find out what version it needs.<br>\n3. use the <code>Content-Type</code> / <code>Accept</code> header approach to negotiate a mutually supported version between the client and server.</p>\n<p>see #154 </p>\n</blockquote>",
