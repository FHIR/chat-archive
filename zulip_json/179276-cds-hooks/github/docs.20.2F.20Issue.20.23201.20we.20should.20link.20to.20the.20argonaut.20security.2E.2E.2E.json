It shouldn' be within the specification itself, because it's supporting material. Maybe a new header within the Community page? Something like:<br>\nArgonaut Security Review:<br>\nTo mature the CDS Hooks specification to 1.0, the Argonaut Project conducted a <a href=\"http://example.com/link-to-security-review\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://example.com/link-to-security-review\">independent security review</a> of the specification, which identified and addressed a number of potential risks. </p>\n</blockquote>",
