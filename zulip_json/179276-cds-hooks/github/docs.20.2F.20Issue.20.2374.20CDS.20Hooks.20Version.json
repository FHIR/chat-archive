This allows the CDS Service to respond accordingly (for instance, perhaps the Discovery response flexes to only return CDS Services that can handle the particular CDS Hooks specification version in use).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furthermore, I'll echo @olbrich's suggestion of a new JSON field or HTTP header are both options to communicate the specification version.</p>\n<p>My proposal is that we do not address this today. We only need to address this once we introduce a new version of the CDS Hooks specification in which the CDS Service needs to change its behavior based upon the specification version in use. If we introduce a new specification version that contains breaking or other changes which necessitate its communication, we can simply add this per the above options. The absence of this version information just means we're dealing with pre-specification versions in which this information doesn't matter (eg, 1.0).</p>\n<p>If the community is OK with this proposal, we'd close this issue and simply re-open it if we end up needing to address this due to a future specification change.</p>\n</blockquote>",
