While this seems logically to make sense, it does not jive well with existing FHIR resource interpreting packages such as HAPI. The result is a bit of nasty code to decode as JSON, iterate the list, creating JSON strings from the resource, and then using HAPI to parse (alternatively you must do something similar but create a bundle). A list of resources is generally represented by a bundle within FHIR, and I think this is how any list of resources should be represented in cds hooks context/prefetch.</p>\n</blockquote>",

By suggesting that related resources could also be included in the bundle, are you thinking of contained resources?</p>\n</blockquote>",

In the case of order-review, orders may contain MedicationOrders, which in turn would also possibly contain Medications. Generally for any MedicationOrder, it is really useful for my service to have the associated Medication. There is not a good way to do this through prefetch (at least I don't think there is).  While not a 1.0 issue it might also be good to have some way to tell the EHR what we really need for context data in a future version. This could drive in the direction of #155  or what @euvitudo  is suggesting. In either case, using a bundle rather than an array works well. </p>\n</blockquote>",
