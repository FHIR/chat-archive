So if I have a CDS Service, and a client sent me a request, how do I tell if the prefetch is using DSTU2/STU3/R4 resources, without hitting the FHIR metatdata endpoint unnecessarily? </p>\n<p>I think we are at a point where the standard is mature enough that this question should probably be addressed. </p>\n</blockquote>",
