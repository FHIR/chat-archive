In general, the CDS Hooks spec purposely permits UI to remain the responsibility of the EHR. We want the CDS service's cards to appear native in the EHR UI. Further, my opinion is that dictating UI hinders innovation in UX.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The EHR MUST provide access to all cards. SHOULD display them all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Further, I think that the EHR should (continue to) be enabled to dynamically decide what guidance to provide to the clinician based upon the priority and amount of internal and external guidance available. In practice, this could mean using the CDS Hooks response indicator element to prioritize the guidance displayed to the user.</p>\n<p>Isaac</p>\n</blockquote>",

I have no clear opinion on whether this should be in or out.</p>\n<p>The second part is more important:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The EHR MUST provide access to all cards. SHOULD display them all</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>CDS Services work with clinical data and may provide relevant information. The EHR cannot determine what the (medical) risks are for not showing the feedback of the CDS Service. As such I think that it should be mandatory that all cards must be accessible. Preferably shown.<br>\nWe could limit mandating this to only cards with &lt;warning&gt; and &lt;hard-stop&gt; response indicators.</p>\n<p>Bas</p>\n</blockquote>",
