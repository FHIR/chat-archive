While we are extremely reluctant to introduce any new scope into the impending 1.0 release, I think this change would be an easy and welcome addition to 1.0. It doesn't introduce any new features of implementers and simply clarifies the actor we've had trouble describing (narrowly using EHR).</p>\n</blockquote>",
