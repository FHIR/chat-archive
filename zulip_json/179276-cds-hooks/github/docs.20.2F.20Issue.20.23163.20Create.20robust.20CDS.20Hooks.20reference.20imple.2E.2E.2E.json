Having a reference implementation would help ensure changes to the specification are illustrated in code, compatible with existing implementations, and good examples for other implementers.</p>\n<p>Today, our <a href=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/sandbox\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/sandbox\">cds-hooks/sandbox</a> is the closest to an EHR reference implementation that we have; same for <a href=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/sandbox-cds-services\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/sandbox-cds-services\">cds-hooks/sandbox-cds-services</a> for a CDS Service reference implementation.</p>\n<p>However, neither project has a test suite that would allow us to more formally ensuring correctness across specification versions/changes. Additionally, both projects do not implement the specification fully.</p>\n<p>I'm inclined to make this a 1.0 milestone, though I recognize that this will have implications on our desired/proposed release timelines.</p>\n</blockquote>",
