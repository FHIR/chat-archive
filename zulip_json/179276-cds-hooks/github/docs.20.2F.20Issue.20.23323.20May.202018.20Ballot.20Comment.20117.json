Which is to say that a full JSON object would be beneficial (e.g., a Parameters resource).  That's really what I wanted to say and ultimately wasn't clear on that (apologies).</p>\n<p>A couple alternatives to consider:</p>\n<p>1. allow passing a Parameters resource in the CDSResponse (as part of the spec) where the appContext could reference the ID<br>\n2. set the value of appContext field to the Parameters resource</p>\n<p>In either case, the EHR can either (1) pass the Parameters as part of the OAuth 2 access token, or (2) provide a reference to the Parameters, where the SoF app would then obtain them via the EHR's FHIR service.  Both the EHR and the SoF app must understand the protocol.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The value is inherently something only the CDS Service and SMART app understand (which you pointed out too). As such, choosing a string type allows CDS Hooks to support any data the two entities want to communicate between each other. Parties that want to share simple data can do so easily with a simple string; if you want to share more complex data in a richer format, you can do as well by simply serializing it as json (like in the above example).</p>\n<p>Choosing some other type like the FHIR Parameters resource also allows any data to be shared, albeit in a more verbose fashion. So, if you want to communicate this data via the Parameters resource, feel free to -- just serialize it over in the string field. We believe the majority of SMART apps/CDS Services won't communicate using that data type; most are just wanting to communicate a simple bit of data (like session/reference id).</p>\n<p>Thanks again for the additional clarification behind your ballot comment. I've tagged this for discussion on the May 30th CDS working group call. Let me know if you want to discuss it on a different CDS working group call.</p>\n</blockquote>",
