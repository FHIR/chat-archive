Currently it seems like a human needs to read the hook definition and manually implement support for a particular hook and its context fields rather than being able to consumer a machine readable description.</p>\n<p>The spec goes part way by providing machine readable service discovery but that seems to be predicated on existing support for the hooks referenced in the discovery response.</p>\n</blockquote>",

In order to full understand how an application, EHR, or CDS Service implements a hook, you need to know the clinical scenario the hook represents. \"This hook is invoked when the user starts the process of charting a lab result\" or \"This hook is invoked when the user begins a Zika screening workflow\" are just two examples of scenarios that really can only be understood through some narrative text.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as hooks define their own context, I don't know how we can standardize on context names/values because, well, they are unique to hooks. <span class=\"emoji emoji-1f604\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> We would never be able to define a comprehensive set of possible hook context field as some new hook will always be created that has a new context field that doesn't exist in that standard set. And for each hook context field, we again need some narrative to explain just what the field represents.</p>\n<p>I'm open to more concrete ideas and suggestions for improving our current definitions while still balancing the simplicity that makes CDS Hooks so attractive for implementers.</p>\n</blockquote>",

E.g. I could imagine whole host of CDS hooks that support the \"prescribing a new medication\" scenario that could easily share a context such that you add a new hook automatically without treating it as a snowflake. Maybe I'm underestimating the complexity but it seems like some level of standardization here could bring benefits.</p>\n</blockquote>",
