DeviceRequest and SupplyRequest are needed by Davinci.  DeviceRequest is going to subsume VisionPrescription but is also used for prosthetics, pacemakers, etc. where hooks may be relevant for research, enforcing best practice, interaction with payers.  SupplyRequest will be relevant for coverage requirements but is also possibly relevant for other types of decision support.  </p>\n<p>Task and CommunicationRequest aren't needed by DaVinci.  However, a request to cancel/suspend an order or a request to share information with someone else both seem like orders that might reasonably trigger decision support, so we might as well be thorough</p>\n<p>Across versions, this would be:<br>\nR4: DeviceRequest, SupplyRequest, CommunicationRequest, Task<br>\nSTU3: DeviceRequest, SupplyRequest, CommunicationRequest, Task<br>\nDSTU2: DeviceUseRequest, SupplyRequest, CommunicationRequest, Order</p>\n</blockquote>",
