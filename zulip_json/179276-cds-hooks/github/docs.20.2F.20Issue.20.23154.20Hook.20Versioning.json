Upon re-reading this issue seems to conflate that  and the specific hook definition version at first, but then seems to move toward only to the hook definition version. So yea, not a dupe :)</p>\n<p>Is there consensus forming that the hook definition version ought to be handled by the service discovery endpoint using different URLs? I guess it might be nice to advertise when a hook has been deprecated in favor of another...</p>\n</blockquote>",
