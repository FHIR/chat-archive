As written, it follows that the existence of Foo version 1.0 implies there can never be a Foo version 2.0. This isn't how I usually see semantic versioning applied, as it seems to defeat the point entirely.</p>\n<p>It seems it would be better to keep hook names consistent, but have services declare the hook <em>and</em> version they're implemented against -- and EHRs to send the hook <em>and</em> version in the CDS Service call. Due to semantic versioning, EHRs would know which services can support their version of the hook. Wouldn't that be more in line with typical semantic versioning practices?</p>\n<p>## <span class=\"emoji emoji-1f1e9-1f1ea\" title=\"de\">:de:</span> KÃ¶ln May 2018 Working Group Vote</p>\n<p>@kpshek moved the following disposition, seconded by @isaacvetter.</p>\n<p><strong>Disposition:</strong> Persuasive with Mod<br>\n<strong>Disposition Comment:</strong><br>\n  We will keep major version changes to hooks as new hook names, but add guidance to name hooks with the version number (after 1.x) with \"-2\", \"-3\", etc. Eg: patient-view-2, patient-view-3, etc.</p>\n<p><span class=\"emoji emoji-1f44d\" title=\"+1\">:+1:</span> For: 11<br>\n<span class=\"emoji emoji-1f611\" title=\"expressionless\">:expressionless:</span> Abstain: 0<br>\n<span class=\"emoji emoji-1f44e\" title=\"-1\">:-1:</span> Against: 0</p>\n<p><span class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span> The motion passed! <span class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p>_This issue was imported by @cds-hooks-bot from the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/cds-hooks-may-2018-ballot-comments\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bit.ly/cds-hooks-may-2018-ballot-comments\">consolidated CDS Hooks May 2018 ballot spreadsheet</a>._</p>\n</blockquote>",
