We thus have a situation where the user should not be bothered with any information but the EHR needs to receive information for auditing purposes.</p>\n<p>I recall there were discussions around whenever every card must be displayed to the user, and while I can't find the outcome of that right now, I think the consensus was that every card does need to be displayed to the user. How can the CDS service then return audit information for the \"no action\" usecase without spamming the user?</p>\n</blockquote>",
