I think it would be good to get implementer feedback (both from CDS clients and services) as to if this approach is better.</p>\n<p>In Cerner's case, our ordering module is generic and allows for any order type (eg: medication, lab, radiology, etc) to be ordered. So, a generic hook seems like it would fit well with our implementation. I am not aware of other EHR vendors but I imagine some only support certain order types so they may not feel the same way.</p>\n<p>In my experience over the past few years working with CDS Service Providers, they seem to all deal with very specific order types. That's not to say they won't expand beyond this, but it will be interesting to see how they view this more generic hook.</p>\n<p>One of the benefits of a more specific hook is that it is clear what is supported by the CDS client (eg, EHR vendor). For instance, if I say I support medication-prescribe (or say, medication-select), it is very clear what I support. However, the same cannot be said about a more generic hook like order-select. For instance, I just may support order-select for medication but not anything else.</p>\n<p>The good thing is that our existing medication-prescribe and order-review have really not been put through the paces with implementer feedback. So, now is a great time to be discussing changes like this.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The more generic we make a hook, the more complexity it may accrue in order to handle the various scenarios. I wonder if our worldview here is being colored by the generic ordering hooks fits the UX paradigms of Cerner &amp; Epic's EHRs.</p>\n<p>Another thought - the fact that FHIR has distinct resources for these order types makes a possible generic ordering hook cumbersome. Specifically, the <code>context</code> will be potentially complex with varied resource types.</p>\n<p>I mention this not intending to squash this proposal; but I just wanted to capture my initial reaction. Ultimately, I think the broader community who wants to use these hooks need to get involved and we can go with the consensus decision.</p>\n<p>One final thought - a generic order review/sign hook likely needs to exist for CDS services that want have a holistic look at everything being ordered in order to provide good guidance/CDS. Given that, going broad for all of the other order hooks may be the right thing to do.</p>\n</blockquote>",

It is what I would expect because that is what I understand clinicians to expect. <br>\n(2) Agree that medication-prescribe and order-review have not really been put through a lot of implementation - and so now is the time to change it. Naturally, trying to implement them was when the issue came up for me. <br>\n(3) Your statement of complexity with regard to generic hooks is not accurate. Order-review is a generic hook right now, so changing from medication-prescribe to order-selection will make them both better aligned, reducing implementer complexity due to one less difference. Likewise, regardless of context, if the CDSS asks for a resource, the EHR has to be able to include that in the prefetch, so that the EHR has to have the capability anyway (aside from the cutting corners of saying, we don't support prefetch - go fetch it yourself).</p>\n<p>I also am still not super sure that defining all the orders / meds in the context of these hooks is appropriate. The CDSS on the other side likely may not care about all these orders. It will only care about certain types of orders, at least in most of the use-cases we have - radiology decision support, high cost lab prior auth, certain medication dosing / appropriateness etc. So within what we know, I don't see the value of the generic context. My personal take is that the orders the CDSS cares about should go in the prefetch because that will allow a more specific subset. That said, this should not be included in the scope of this github issue.</p>\n</blockquote>",

(Most EHR systems don't (yet?) expose \"draft\" content.)  The CDSS would look at both what orders are already in place as well as what draft orders are part of the bundle in deciding what action to recommend.  In most cases the queries for orders already in place would be by direct query rather than prefetch as \"what orders are relevant\" would be highly contextual and it's unlikely the CDSS would ask for all active orders (or that the EHR would choose to deliver that).</p>\n<p>Understood that medication prescribe wouldn't cover it.  As mentioned earlier, I think medication prescribe should be defined as occurring earlier in the workflow - at the time of drug selection, long before the order is fully entered.  And in that case, you really don't need more than a single order at a time unless you're looking to do drug-drug-interaction checking between the selected drug and other (likely more complete) draft orders.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Ideally, this WOULD be supported in the FHIR interface, because we care about this info whether you are in a CDS Hooks context or not.  E.g., in a SMART on FHIR app that is recommending whether a patient with diabetes needs an A1c test, you don't only care about A1c that have been resulted or ordered; you also care about the A1c that is in unsigned orders, because you would look silly recommending that an A1c be ordered when they've already done so and put it in the unsigned orders.<br>\n- I think it would be good to also support only partially completed unsigned orders, i.e., in the order-select hook (e.g., where you've only said you are going to prescribe atenolol PO, but not how frequently or for how long).  For non-medications, it would be good for these to also use a standard orderable catalog, with standard codes.  But even having EHR vendor or implementation-specific codes would be much better than having nothing.<br>\n- I can see both sides of the argument of whether to make it fully generic vs. type specific (e.g., medication orders vs. procedure orders).  I don't think we should get any more specific than meds vs. non-meds (i.e., procedures), though, as distinguishing between different types of procedures is difficult.  We should also potentially make clear how immunizations cross this bound.  Possibly another reason to combine the two.<br>\n- I agree that whatever is chosen, it should be clear what will be sent with regard to medication orders vs. procedure orders.<br>\n- For orders that haven't been yet signed, the quantity of orders we are talking should be limited, and in memory -- so I see little performance benefit in NOT retrieving and sending the available information.  If there is one.  Perhaps I'm missing something here though.<br>\n- I'll contribute another use case to the desire of knowing orders across the main types (medications vs. procedures): recommending an invasive procedure like a lumbar puncture, need to make sure the patient is not about to be co-prescribed anti-coagulant (blood thinning) medications.  And vice versa.<br>\n- P.S. Lloyd's example is common -- med ordering to check for monitoring labs ordered (e.g., vanconymcin levels)</p>\n</blockquote>",

The clinician workflow is that they are selecting a few orders (or even opening an order set), so that the first order may not have any others already in the shopping cart, but subsequent ones will have 'already-selected' orders in the shopping cart which the current order is being selected. I would favor implementing the \"order-select\" hook to include all orders in the cart, while marking the particular order which was selected in this instance of the hook.

However, if we include all in the context, the CDSS does not have any option to choose not to receive all; whereas if we say the orders go in prefetch, the CDSS can exactly specify the orders it wants. If it wants all orders, it can say so, but if it only cares about a particular med and associated blood monitoring, it can say it only wants that subset to be sent. </p>\n<p>Personally, I am fine with either option.
