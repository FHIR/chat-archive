If a service implements against v1.1 of the hook, they expect the \"foo\" to always be provided -- but if the EHR is implemented against v1.0 of the hook, this will not be the case -- and the service will be broken.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>_This issue was imported by @cds-hooks-bot from the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/cds-hooks-may-2018-ballot-comments\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bit.ly/cds-hooks-may-2018-ballot-comments\">consolidated CDS Hooks May 2018 ballot spreadsheet</a>._</p>\n</blockquote>",
