For instance, if you could highlight particular statements or passages and explain what is confusing, that would help us better understand what proposed changes we could make to clarify our documentation.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Eg, something like this after the intro paragraph would be good. <br>\nHook context is... &lt;definition&gt;. An example of this is &lt;example&gt; where &lt;x data&gt; is the context for the hook since that's how the EHR workflow or action set the context. <br>\nIn contrast, prefetch is &lt;definition&gt;. In our earlier example, an example of pre-fetch would be &lt;example&gt;. </p>\n<p>I think the info is all there but is a bit disorganized. Differentiating what would be a context vs what would be prefetched like you have with the example \"Therefore, including the full patient resource in context would be unnecessary. For CDS Services that want the full patient resource, they can request it to be prefetched or fetch it as needed from the FHIR server.\" ... this can be pulled up earlier so it's immediately clear. </p>\n</blockquote>",
