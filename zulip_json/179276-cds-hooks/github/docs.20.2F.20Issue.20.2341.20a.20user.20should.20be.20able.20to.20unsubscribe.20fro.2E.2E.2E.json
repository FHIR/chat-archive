If the EHR or healthsystem simply pre-populated discovery endpoints, it would be theoretically possible for the EHR to present all services to the end-user for \"subscriptions\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Should a clinician be able to unsubscribe from any card? This gives the user more control, but may also prevent important feedback from being delivered at the point of care. Does this introduce a patient safety risk?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above question also came up a few times in the CDS and CQI working group meetings at the HL7 WGM in Madrid this week. Yes, indeed, supporting a straight, simple end-user unsubscribe could be dangerous or at least very likely to break healthsystem policy. In reality, an unsubscribe feature should be carefully supported by the EHR per service, based upon the purpose of the service and the clinical and business policies. Since the desire to support unsubscribe ought not to be decided by the service, it should be up to the EHR to display the option to unsubscribe from a card based upon careful implementation and/or configuration. </p>\n<p>The EHR could implement the unsubscribe itself, and simply stop calling the service based upon user preferences; however, the feedback implicit in an unsubscribe is valuable to the service.</p>\n<p>All the above means that the spec itself needn't worry about placing guardrails around unsubscribe. The question is: how could we structure the analytics endpoint to support this and other desired feedback to the service.</p>\n<p>Isaac</p>\n</blockquote>",
