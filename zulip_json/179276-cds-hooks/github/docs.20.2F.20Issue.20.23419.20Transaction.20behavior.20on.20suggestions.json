As such, the creates (or updates) will need to be processed in a transactional manner.   At present, the CDS Hook specification does not provide any guidance setting this expectation, nor does it provide guidance about how resources are to point to each other.  Suggest adding guidance that states that resource ids must be included in the resource instances to be \"created\" if there are interdependency issues and that the actions will be processed as a FHIR \"transaction\" with the full URLs being inferred as the base URL of the CDS client's server.</p>\n</blockquote>",
