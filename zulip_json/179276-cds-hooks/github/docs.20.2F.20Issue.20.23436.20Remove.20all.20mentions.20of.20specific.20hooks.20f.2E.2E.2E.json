Eg:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For example, <code>medication-prescribe</code> and <code>order-review</code> define context fields containing FHIR resources that represent draft resources.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think we should add clarifying text to indicate these are examples. For instance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For example, imagine a hook <code>medication-order</code> that is invoked when a user selects a medication during an order workflow. The context data for this hook would contain draft FHIR resources representing the medications that have been selected for ordering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The hooks we are referencing today will likely change over time and I don't want the specification (which will be much longer lived) to refer to these outdated hooks.</p>\n<p>Thoughts on ensuring this happens before the 1.0 release?</p>\n<p>cc @isaacvetter @brynrhodes @brettmarquard </p>\n</blockquote>",
