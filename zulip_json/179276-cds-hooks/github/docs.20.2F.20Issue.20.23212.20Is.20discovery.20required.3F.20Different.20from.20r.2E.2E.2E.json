The spec seems to suggest that a CDS Service Provider provides a URL listing the supported CDS Services to be added to the EHR list. <br>\n The sections above seem to suggest that registration is out-of-scope, still the CDS Service Provider must provide a stable end-point.<br>\n As the model is backed with mandatory statements (see below, some text (and a picture) explaining this model would be required. <br>\n Alternatively, keep the discovery model out of scope and make the mandotory text lower case.</p>\n<p>## Triage Information</p>\n<p><strong>Triage Notes:</strong><br>\n  Reviewed with Bas</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Disposition:</strong> Persuasive<br>\n<strong>Proposed Disposition Comment:</strong><br>\n  Bas will help us get a PR together.
