Am I missing or misinterpreting something?</p>\n<p>Please also refer to this Zulip topic. <a href=\"https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/cds-hooks/subject/CDS.20async.20reply/near/93110\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/cds-hooks/subject/CDS.20async.20reply/near/93110\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/cds-hooks/subject/CDS.20async.20reply/near/93110</a></p>\n<p>Thanks in advance, Bart.</p>\n</blockquote>",
