Please indicate the version of the spec in the documentation.<br>\n- the specification is written in a descriptive manner. This makes it hard to distinguish between mandatory, optional and recommended specification elements. One way to address this it to follow is to label them with SHALL, SHOULD, MAY type of statement as is defined by the IETF guidelines on this topic (<a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt\">https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt</a>)<br>\n- where the specification refers to elements defined elsewhere, please provide a reference and version indication.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The specification will be versioned and the 1.0 draft is available at <a href=\"http://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/\">http://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/</a> (see PR #115 for this change).
