Also note that the SMART spec doesn't address this either. </p>\n<p>In practice, the best (and I think, common) approach to this problem is by the EHR / SMART Server hosting the app within an iframe within the patient's chart. By doing this, the SMART app is naturally subject to changes made to its container. </p>\n<p>To illustrate: the patient's chart is a web page in a browser, the SMART app is an iframe within that web page, when the user changes the patient, the SMART app iframe is closed and the user or EHR must relaunch the SMART app within the newly opened patient's chart.</p>\n<p>I'd like to close this issue because I think that this concern, while real and important, is clearly outside the scope of CDS Hooks. Concerns?</p>\n<p>Isaac</p>\n</blockquote>",

These relate to situations were additional browser windows are opened and need to be closed as the main window changes to a different patient.<br>\nIn my opionion this is within scope of CDS Hooks. But not in the scope of the v1.0 release. Maybe we can discuss it further in the May meeting in Cologne.</p>\n<p>Bas</p>\n</blockquote>",
