E.g., if the attending on record is Dr. Smith, and resident Dr. Jones is placing orders, shouldn't Dr. Jones see the CDS content even though he/she isn't the attending on record?  Also, couldn't the context data be from a prior encounter?  E.g., you are here for an office visit, but you care about lab results taken from a prior visit as a prefetch.  E.g., when you are ordering an HbA1c, to make sure an HbA1c hasn't already been ordered in the past 2 months (minimal interval should usually be about q3months).</p>\n</blockquote>",

I included them because it's clear it's not a ubiquitious rule - so it's a good case for considering how far the hook definition should go, and what should be local.
