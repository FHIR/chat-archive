It's perfectly reasonable to add in new, system-specific fields in an integration and even to use them across multiple implementations. </p>\n<p>The concern with your above approach is that they enable the possibility of standardizing extensions and explicitly using the FHIR approach. It's not obvious that we need to either standardize extensions and in other aspects of the CDS Hooks specification, we've specifically avoided copying FHIR for the sake of copyign FHIR. Rather CDS Hooks has stayed simpler, with more elegant structures because we haven't copied FHIR.</p>\n<p>To that end how about this:<br>\n - The CDS Hooks spec reserves the name \"extension\".<br>\n- the content and datatype of this object is dependent upon the implementation.<br>\n- extension can live at any level in any CDS Hooks message.<br>\n- implementors should ignore any object named extension that they don't know about.</p>\n<p>Isaac</p>\n</blockquote>",

I am not under the impression that extensions will be custom for each pair of service and consumer. In most cases, certain consumers will require a particular set of extensions from all services, and a particular service will provide a set of extensions to all consumers. Over time, some of those extensions will become common among many services and many consumers before they are added to the spec. Also over time, many extensions may be added that are somewhat similar, but not semantically equivalent - ie the risk of extension name collisions will increase.</p>\n<p>I actually think the FHIR approach for extensions is very elegant, though it does have its limitations. It solves the above issues and has already stood the test of (at least some) time.</p>\n<p>In any case, an extension needs an identifier. This can be the field name (if it is long and doesn't conflict). However the FHIR approach of a list of objects, where the object contains a url is a bit cleaner IMHO.</p>\n</blockquote>",
