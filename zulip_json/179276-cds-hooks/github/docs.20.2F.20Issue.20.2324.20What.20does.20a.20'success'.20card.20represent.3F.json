This group of ~12 represented a broad set of stakeholders, from multiple EHR vendors, several CDS Service providers, and a healthcare organization. What follows is the summary of our discussion and the consensus of the group.</p>\n<p>We all agreed that the <code>success</code> indicator value should be removed as no one could articulate a use case that warrants its inclusion. Additionally, we all agreed that cards should be user facing constructs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the proper way to tell the consuming system that there were no suggestions/warnings/information? Note that this may be required and include extra information for supporting PAMA/etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding this use case, we acknowledge this needs to be addressed. See #48 regarding discussion around a proposal for this.</p>\n</blockquote>",
