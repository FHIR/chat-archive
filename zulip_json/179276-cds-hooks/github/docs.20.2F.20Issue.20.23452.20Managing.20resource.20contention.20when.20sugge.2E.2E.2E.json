Otherwise, two \"simultaneous\" updates could trample one another.</p>\n<p>When a CDS service returns a card with a suggested update to a FHIR resource, there is no concept of supplying something like an If-Match.  However, if another workflow makes an update before the action is accepted, loss of data could result.  Semantics/documentation need to be added for handling this scenario.</p>\n</blockquote>",
