When it invokes the service, it will pass the state. This prevents a lot of (difficult) bookkeeping in the services (such as determining when how long a state should be maintained).  </p>\n<p><strong>Suggested change:</strong><br>\nPreferably one would have the CDS services stateless and store the state in the EHR application. Can’t we have the CDS Service pass a optional “opaque” state object when it redirects back to the EHR. The EHR then appends this object to the CDS Service request. Thereby passing the state.</p>\n</blockquote>",
