The prefetch definitions provided in discovery need to reference user, patient, encounter, and potentially other elements which may be defined in the context of the given hook. These two needs should have a clear relationship. After discussing with @kpshek, I would propose the following for prefetch definition replacements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue to use the same delimiters. ie '{{', '}}'</li>\n<li>Reference the user via 'user'</li>\n<li>Reference context entries via prefix 'context.' to the name of the context field. For example 'context.patientid'</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that this does not support structures in the context values. Rather than provide some form of structure support (ie the id field of a MedicationOrder), define a separate field for that id in the context to make it usable in prefetch.</p>\n</blockquote>",
