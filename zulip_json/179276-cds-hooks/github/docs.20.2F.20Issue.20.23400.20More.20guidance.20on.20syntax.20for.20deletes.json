There are no examples in the spec. \"resource\" is noted as being of type object, so it's not clear if I should say this: <code>\"resource\" : \"someId\"</code> or this <code>\"resource\":{\"id\": \"someId\"}</code></p>\n<p>(Isaac indicated that his expectation was <code>\"resource\": {\"resourceType\": \"MedicationRequest\", \"id\": \"someId\" }</code> - and given that ids are only unique within a resource type, that's probably wise)</p>\n<p>It would be good to at least include an example showing expected syntax.</p>\n</blockquote>",
