For example, the request may have resulted in no cards because no interaction with the clinician was necessary, but the order must be updated with a rating. The specification does not prevent this, but nor does it recognize it as a valid workflow. As a result, EMRs might deny this type of processing. This scenario should be added to the documentation to make it clear that EMRs must support this type of processing.</p>\n</blockquote>",
