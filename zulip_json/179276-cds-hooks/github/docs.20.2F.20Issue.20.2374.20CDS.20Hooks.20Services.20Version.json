If a CDS Service is offered as software as a service (SaaS), and every company I've talked to is working under this model, then I'm not sure why version needs to be exposed.</p>\n<p>If the CDS Service provider wants to explicitly version its services, this would be best put in the <code>id</code> field.</p>\n<p>For instance, in your above example the CDS Service would be available at <a href=\"https://example.com/static-patient-greeter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://example.com/static-patient-greeter\">https://example.com/static-patient-greeter</a>. So, when you version it to 2.0 it's still at the same URL. If your intention is to allow the EHR to make a purposeful decision to move to 2.0 then you'd want the URL to change too. So, the <code>id</code> could be <code>static-patient-greeter-2.0</code> making the URL <a href=\"https://example.com/static-patient-greeter-2.0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://example.com/static-patient-greeter-2.0\">https://example.com/static-patient-greeter-2.0</a></p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n</blockquote>",
