For context, there is no similar constraint. Additionally, I don't see a reason why context <em>cannot</em> contain any valid JSON datatype. Context is workflow/EHR dependent (we obviously want to align/standardize common hooks like <code>patient-view</code>) and the contextual data may fall outside of FHIR.</p>\n<p>I don't feel like we're shirking our responsibilities here. I think defining context as we've done today is prudent and, until we start seeing the hooks defined by the community, we can start promoting concrete best practices. Until we have a far more robust hook catalog, I don't see increasing our initial release scope to embark on an effort to determine such guidelines, recommendations, or best practices nor establish what an official hook registry may contain. In the latter case, we made a conscious design to break the individual hooks out of the specification -- both so that we can add/modify hooks without releasing a new specification version as well as the ability to defer some of these questions which will remain unanswered until we see more hook definitions being prototyped and implemented in production.</p>\n<p>In an effort to keep these ideas flowing around hook design best practices, I've started this <a href=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Hook-Design-Best-Practices\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Hook-Design-Best-Practices\">Wiki page</a>.
