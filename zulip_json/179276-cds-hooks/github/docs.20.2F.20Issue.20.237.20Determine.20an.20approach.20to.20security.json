In the proposed model there will be similar calls to discover jwks_uri and inturn get the public key (or atleast one)</p>\n<p>While I generally prefer to use JWS and moved beyond JWT even for SMART on FHIR token response, I was wondering if we should be aligned with SMART on FHIR at this point atleast to begin with. </p>\n<p>I missed the discussion happened in San Antonia early this year and also Security WG presentation in Madrid. So appreciate any input</p>\n<p>To the outstanding question at the end of proposed model (if we decide go with the proposed model), I am inclined to having FHIR server as the issuer (again to be in sync with SMART on FHIR) and adding jwks_uri ( or public key) to Conformance</p>\n</blockquote>",

I don't think CDS vendors would like to trust an unsigned jwt for SSO (authentication) when pushed as opposed to pulling (or requesting) the token in the case of the authorization grant or client credential flow. I agree with preference to have an FHIR extension to serve the public key uri </p>\n<p>With the assumption of requiring id_token to be signed and using the same for discovery end point calls, we should think about how to exchange the FHIR base URL assuming FHIR Conformance is used serve public key uri</p>\n<p>Keeping the cost of handling the token proactively on the EHR for performance reasons is great, but there will be over the wire transactions to get the public key (basically hitting FHIR server to get the conformance to get the public key (jwks_uri) end point and in turn public key for CDS Service provider to validate the id_token with incoming requests. Question:  Based on the scope authorized by a particular CDS Hook service, I would assume there will be more than one access token generated and cached at the EHR side based on the user/cds hook service. How do EHR plan to handle this? </p>\n</blockquote>",
