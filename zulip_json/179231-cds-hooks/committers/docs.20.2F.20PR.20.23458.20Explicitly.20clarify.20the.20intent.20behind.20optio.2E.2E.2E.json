This PR was a topic of discussion and for the most part, the informal poll we took in the room was that the majority just want a decision on this topic (whatever that may be) and that aligning with FHIR's model in this regard was fine.</p>\n<p>In a hallway conversation with @brynrhodes, we both think we change the only exception case we have right now (the response <code>cards</code> array which must always be valued, even with an empty array) to following this new requirement. This would mean that this line:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If your CDS Service has no decision support for the user, your service should return a 200 HTTP response with an empty array of cards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Would be changed to something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If your CDS Service has no decision support for the user, your service should return a 200 HTTP response and the <code>cards</code> field omitted from the response object.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While that would mean the response object would be <code>{}</code> today, I foresee us adding additional top-level response fields in the future (like the system actions in the <a href=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Decision-Proposal\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Decision-Proposal\">decisions proposal</a>). Did this get discussed in the working group meeting today along with the vote?</p>\n</blockquote>",
