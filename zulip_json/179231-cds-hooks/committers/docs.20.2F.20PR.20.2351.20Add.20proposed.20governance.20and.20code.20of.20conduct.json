Thanks to many others who reviewed a draft of this proposed governance model and provided feedback.</p>\n<p>As CDS Hooks matures as a community and standard, we feel it is important to formalize our governance process and establish a code of conduct. This will ensure that we all work in the same manner and have clear expectations for how we work.</p>\n<p>Feedback and comments from everyone is welcome.</p>\n<p>I will have an update for this pull request where both the governance and code of conduct are referenced in the homepage.</p>\n</blockquote>",
