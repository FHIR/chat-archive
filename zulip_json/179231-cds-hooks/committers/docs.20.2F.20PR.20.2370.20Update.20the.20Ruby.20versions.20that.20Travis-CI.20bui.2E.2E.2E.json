Additionally, by specifying just the major and minor version and not the revision (eg, 2.3 instead of 2.3.0), this will allow Travis to use the latest revision/patch during builds.</p>\n<p>This should fix the <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/cds-hooks/docs/jobs/257608496\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://travis-ci.org/cds-hooks/docs/jobs/257608496\">recent Travis-CI build failures</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>5.72s$ rvm use 2.1.0 --install --binary --fuzzy\nruby-2.1.0 is not installed - installing.\nSearching for binary rubies, this might take some time.\nRequested binary installation but no rubies are available to download, consider skipping --binary flag.\nGemset &#39;&#39; does not exist, &#39;rvm ruby-2.1.0 do rvm gemset create &#39; first, or append &#39;--create&#39;.\nThe command &quot;rvm use 2.1.0 --install --binary --fuzzy&quot; failed and exited with 2 during .\nYour build has been stopped.\n</pre></div>\n\n\n</blockquote>",

In researching this error, I found that the <a href=\"https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/2220\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/2220\">best practice</a> is to reference Ruby versions up to the minor release (eg, 2.1 instead of 2.1.0) and let Travis choose the latest Ruby on that minor release.</p>\n<p>Previously, we were building with both 2.0.0 and 2.1.0. This pull request changes that to simply 2.3 (so 2.3.x). I tried also building with 2.4 (so 2.4.x) but version of the json gem we're pulling in doesn't support Ruby 2.4 (see <a href=\"https://github.com/flori/json/issues/303\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/flori/json/issues/303\">https://github.com/flori/json/issues/303</a>).</p>\n<p>I'm going to merge these changes into master and sync all branches so that the Travis CI builds start passing again.</p>\n</blockquote>",
