Moved the example to follow the field specifications (as we discussed).<br>\n2. Added \"Priority\" to all tables (except for the Card Attributes because Priorities were added by PR #131).  <br>\n3. Added sub-sections to show nesting of attributes.<br>\n4. Integrated \"No Decision Support\" content into \"Card Array\" section.<br>\n5. Integrated \"Analytics\" content into \"Suggestion\" section.</p>\n<p>Question:  The Suggestion table references something called \"Suggestion Tracking Analytics.\"  Is this a reference to the (moved) \"Analytics\" section, or to a separate resource?</p>\n</blockquote>",

I've inserted the title as \"Suggestion Tracking Analytics\" as you suggest.  Much better title, and I think better placement as well.  Also recaptured the link.  ;-)</p>\n</blockquote>",
