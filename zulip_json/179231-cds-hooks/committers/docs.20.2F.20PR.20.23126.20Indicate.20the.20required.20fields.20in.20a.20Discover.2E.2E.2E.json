This change illustrates my recommendation that the 1.0 spec needs to be specified more explicitly.  In addition, it carries out my recommendation to make the Prefetch field RECOMMENDED rather than required, so that each provider can decide whether to prefetch or allow the CDS service to fetch its own data as needed.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Agreed that not all CDS services will need prefetched data.<br>\nI do not agree with the recommendation to limit priorities to REQUIRED or not (yes/no).  This specification should use the conformance language specified in RFC 2119 (<a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt\">https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt</a>), just as the FHIR specification and SMART on FHIR specifications (and most other specifications) do.  The nuanced difference between \"not required\" and OPTIONAL or RECOMMENDED is important to capture.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'm fine with specifying either <code>REQUIRED</code> or <code>OPTIONAL</code> for the fields here. I also agree that if we have something that is <code>RECOMMENDED</code> (though we don't here), we can call that out.</p>\n</blockquote>",
