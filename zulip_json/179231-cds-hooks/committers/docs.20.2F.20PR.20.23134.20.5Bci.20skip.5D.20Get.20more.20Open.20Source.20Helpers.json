The app sends subscribers a random<br>\nopen issue for them to help \"triage\". For some languages you can also<br>\nsuggested areas to add documentation.</p>\n<p>The initial approach was inspired by seeing the work of the small<br>\ncore team spending countless hours asking \"what version was<br>\nthis in\" and \"can you give us an example app\". The idea is to<br>\noutsource these small interactions to a huge team of volunteers<br>\nand let the core team focus on their work.</p>\n<p>I want to add a badge to the README of this project. The idea is to<br>\nprovide an easy link for people to get started contributing to this<br>\nproject. A badge indicates the number of people currently subscribed<br>\nto help the repo. The color is based off of open issues in the project.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of other projects that have a badge in their<br>\nREADME:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal\">https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rails/rails\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rails/rails\">https://github.com/rails/rails</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage\">https://github.com/codetriage/codetriage</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for building open source software, I would love to help you find some helpers.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The future contributors we need for this project are focused in the healthcare interoperability standards rather than any developer wanting to look to get involved on an open source project.</p>\n<p>Out of curiosity, what script did you write that identified the ~200 repositories that which you thought were candidates for your product? Just wondering.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Though if you’re not really using issues or pull requests then it won’t be helpful to them.</p>\n<p>Regarding “how did I pick this one?”: Someone added your repo to CodeTriage. They are already using it for your repo so i figured it would be a good fit. Theres currently 23,000 devs signed up to help 2,800 repos and yours is one of them.</p>\n</blockquote>",
