I found that IE 10 and 11 were not able to use <code>postMessage</code> when when they were in separate tabs or windows. It only worked when iframed.</p>\n<p>I also tested this on the current versions of Chrome, Edge, and Safari. Using <code>postMessage</code>worked in both iframed and new tab/window tests.</p>\n<p>Has anyone else done similar tests?  I'm hoping I'm wrong about IE 10 &amp; 11.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'm not sure how much longer those browsers will be officially supported, but I know it can be difficult to get users to change their browsers, particularly when they are part of large organizations with IT departments that are in control of what's on their machines.  The nice thing about the redirect url is that it's browser agnostic, though does require a server.</p>\n</blockquote>",
