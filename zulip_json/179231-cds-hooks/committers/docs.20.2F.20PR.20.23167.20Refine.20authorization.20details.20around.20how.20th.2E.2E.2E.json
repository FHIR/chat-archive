Instead, the documentation just lays out what the access code needs to honor.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this pull request changes the conformance verbiage that states the access token MUST be restricted to the same permissions as the current user. Previously, this was SHOULD but after discussion with @bakerdb, @jmandel, @isaacvetter, @brettmarquard, and myself, we felt MUST was more appropriate.</p>\n<p>This will resolve #159.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This will enable us to make fhirServer REQUIRED within fhirAuthorization, thereby eliminating the need for the (current) explanation that \"If fhirAuthorization is provided, this [OPTIONAL] field is REQUIRED.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@bakerdb - I had this same thought too and we discussed this on one of our previous Argonaut security calls. I had the action item to take this to the broader CDS Hooks community for feedback which uncovered a use case where it is valuable to continue keeping these two fields separated.</p>\n<p>There is a use case in which the FHIR server is not accessible (externally) or does not offer access via the access token (in which case <code>fhirAuthorization</code> is omitted) but the data is available via prefetch; however, the <code>fhirServer</code> parameter is still useful in this scenario as the CDS Service knows where the data came from. Due to this use case (which several developers have in their production environments), keeping our fields as-is is appropriate for everyone.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I knew that we had discussed this and that you were to present it to the CDS Hooks community.  But I was unaware of the resolution.  I don't fully understand why it's necessary for the CDS Service to know where EHR-prefetched data came from, but if existing production environments require the fhirServer parameter, then I see no compelling reason to move it so long as its association with fhirAuthorization is preserved.   </p>\n</blockquote>",
