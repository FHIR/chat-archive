Thanks to many others who reviewed a draft of this proposed governance model and provided feedback.</p>\n<p>As CDS Hooks matures as a community and standard, we feel it is important to formalize our governance process and establish a code of conduct. This will ensure that we all work in the same manner and have clear expectations for how we work.</p>\n<p>Feedback and comments from everyone is welcome.</p>\n<p>I will have an update for this pull request where both the governance and code of conduct are referenced in the homepage.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This will likely require lawyers. To aid with this, <a href=\"http://contributoragreements.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://contributoragreements.org/\">http://contributoragreements.org/</a> exists to allow you to generate a CLA by simply answering some questions.<br>\n- CLAs introduce a barrier to contributors whom may be reluctant to sign a legal document. For contributors that work for an entity/company, they often must get permission from their company to sign any CLAs<br>\n- We need to enforce and maintain our CLAs. Thankfully, free and open-source services like <a href=\"https://cla-assistant.io/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://cla-assistant.io/\">https://cla-assistant.io/</a> exist to handle this.</p>\n<p>If a CLA is not adopted upfront, it is problematic to introduce a CLA at a later date.</p>\n<p>### Trademark</p>\n<p>Once we determine trademark ownership, we should link to a trademark usage document.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>",
