NOTE:  We discussed the fact that aud should not be included in the fhirAuthorization structure because fhirServer was specified outside the fhirAuthorization structure.  However, a dependency exists between the two:  if fhirAuthorization is included, a fhirServer MUST be specified.  I've made them both OPTIONAL here, and noted that if fhirAuthorization is included, fhirServer is REQUIRED.  It might be cleaner to put fhirServer inside the fhirAuthorization structure so that fhirAuthorization could be OPTIONAL, but fhirServer (as a parameter of fhirAuthorization) could be REQUIRED.</p>\n</blockquote>",
