I think the key contributions here are:</p>\n<p>1. Generalizing the activities catalog to work in both directions: an EHR can tell a service \"hey, the user is doing this activity\", and an app can tell the EHR \"hey, here's a good activity for the user to do next\". </p>\n<p>2. Updating the decision data model to support this communication back to the EHR</p>\n<p>I'm definitely in favor.</p>\n<p>I noticed, in the process, that our docs for <code>decisions.create</code> are missing something: they specify a list of ids, but what we actually need (and the way our test implementations work) is a list of resources. Does this match your expectations?</p>\n</blockquote>",

However, as we aren't the FHIR server persisting the resource, we'd have to figure out a way to reference them (in the <code>actions</code> structure). Perhaps the CDS service would mint an ID for each resource and use #anchor-tag style contained reference?</p>\n</blockquote>",
