For example, this field should contain: <code>Practitioner/123</code>. This was done to explicitly support scenarios other than provider-facing, for example, the user could be <code>Patient/456' or </code>Person/789` (following the <a href=\"https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/smart-on-fhir.github.io/issues/148\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/smart-on-fhir.github.io/issues/148\">user-to-FHIR mapping</a>) that SMART negotiated.</p>\n<p>Because of this change, the prefetch example of <code>Practitioner/{{context.userId}}</code> would translate into <code>Practitioner/Practitioner/123</code> as issue #410 points out. </p>\n<p>This PR simply removes the \"Practitioner/\" string from the example, in lieu of the alternative, breaking changes suggested in #410.</p>\n</blockquote>",
