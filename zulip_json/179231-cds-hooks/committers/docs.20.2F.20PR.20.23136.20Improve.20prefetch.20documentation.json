I suggest having one section contain all the discussion about why we have (actually 2) performance enhancements, and about the EHR's ability to choose, and reserving the other section for technical specification of the prefetch template.   Toward this objective, I have:<br>\n1) Clearly separated the two \"prefetch\" sections, with the first discussing both performance enhancement options for providing data (i.e., prefetch and passing bearer token), and the 2nd a technical specification of the \"prefetch template.\"  <br>\n2) Renamed the 1st \"prefetch\" section \"Providing FHIR Resources to the CDS Service\" and the 2nd \"Prefetch Template.\"  <br>\n3) Moved \"discussion\" content out of \"Template\" section and into \"Providing FHIR...\" section.</p>\n</blockquote>",
