For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>What does \"instance level read interactions\" mean? I'm guessing this <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#read\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#read\">read</a> in FHIR? If my understand of that is correct, what does the further qualification of \"for the Patient resource only\" mean?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Does \"type level search interactions\" only mean <code>search</code> and not <code>create</code> or <code>history</code>? Why is <code>GET</code> called out? The EHR can satisfy the prefetch data however it sees fit and I'm not sure what GET vs POST would mean</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Are these similar restrictions defined similar to how you have documented then here somewhere in Clinical Reasoning? If so, where?</p>\n<p>My questions here are just an attempt to ensure that I and everyone else understands very clearly what we're proposing is &amp; isn't allowed in prefetch queries. <img alt=\"ðŸ˜„\" class=\"emoji\" src=\"/static/generated/emoji/images/emoji/unicode/1f604.png\" title=\"ðŸ˜„\"> </p>\n</blockquote>",

There might not be the possibility for the cds-hooks server to pull further information from the EHR at all, for instance. </p>\n<p>I'm not opposed to being able to make - or even recommend - these restrictions (though they need more clarity as Kevin says) but they can't be applied always</p>\n</blockquote>",

I was trying to describe them in terms of the HTTP level FHIR API only, so that was the reason for the reference to GET, but after reading your updates to the prefetch on the other pull, I agree, and I've removed the references to HTTP verbs.</p>\n<p>I've also expanded the Patient request to include resource for which an id is known (so it could include Practitioner or Encounter, for example).</p>\n<p>As far as documentation about how these restrictions are used within Clinical Reasoning, there is documentation on the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/metadatatypes.html#datarequirement\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/metadatatypes.html#datarequirement\">DataRequirement</a>, are you thinking a link there would be helpful?</p>\n<p>@grahamegrieve, agreed, I've relaxed the language to make them 'recommended', rather than 'required'.</p>\n</blockquote>",
