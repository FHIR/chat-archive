By having the yaml, will we need to synchronize that definition whenever things change, or is there a way to drive the specification docs from the yaml?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@brynrhodes - We're always going to have the Markdown + YAML. The YAML allows you to have some documentation as well but mkdocs/Markdown allows a lot more flexibility in the documentation that just isn't possible with the YAML.</p>\n<p>The big benefit of moving the <code>api</code> repository that held this YAML here is that now when we make a change to the specification, we can be sure that both the Open API specification and the mkdocs content is updated together.</p>\n</blockquote>",
