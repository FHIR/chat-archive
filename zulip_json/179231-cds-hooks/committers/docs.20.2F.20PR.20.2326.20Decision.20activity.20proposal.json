I think that a decision returning an EHR activity is great functionality and we should try to make it happen.</p>\n<p>1. I'm not sure that a hook and an activity are actually the same thing. For example, take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Proposed-Hooks\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Proposed-Hooks\">proposed hooks</a>, these seem reasonable as hooks, but aren't specific enough to identify an activity.</p>\n<p>2. How does the decision define the activity's \"parameters\". I think that your example specifies a CarePlan as input to a medication-prescribe activity. What does that mean? Is there a medication that should be pre-populated into the EHR's medication-prescribe activity?</p>\n<p>Isaac</p>\n</blockquote>",

I was thinking we avoid having both a \"hook catalog\" and then another \"post hook catalog\". Especially after observing the contents both describe what I think of as activities. Instead, there would be a single catalog where the usage context would be as a \"hook\" or \"next action\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How does the decision define the activity's \"parameters\".

Have a look and see if this addresses your questions.</p>\n</blockquote>",
