There will be no business arrangement for the diagnostic service to have access back to the EHR (it's technically possible to set it up, but not feasible in practice). So I guess the EHR knows that this is the case ahead of time - by onfiguration, presumably. And i think that the things that cds-hooks can do will make it really compelling to use in spite of complex network topographies, and circumstances where lack of trust is a real impediment to work</p>\n</blockquote>",
