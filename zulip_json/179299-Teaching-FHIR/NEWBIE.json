I have joined as I am wishing to learn FHIR so that I can help the Mental Health Providers in my community better receive and communicate clinical data is a safe and private manner.  My son suffers from a mental illness so this has become a passion of mine.  I have developed restful WCF services using C#, built web and windows applications and know SQL well.  All of my experience is on the Microsoft stack.   I am hoping that some of you can provide guidance on how I could best get started and come up to speed on development with HL7 FHIR.    Thanks,  Dylan</p>",
