        "content": "<p>I helped teach a semester long FHIR Practicum at the Univ. Of Utah’s Biomedical Informatics Dept. It’s geared to graduate informatics students. We lead them through the software development lifecycle. The students form teams led by a mentor. They use use what they learn about SDLC to create a FHIR application. At the end of the semester, they present their application to an informatics evening networking event with academic and industry attendees. I was planning to post a copy of the syllabus on <a href=\"http://FHIR.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://FHIR.org\">FHIR.org</a>.</p>\n<p>We also teach a 2-Day workshop during the summer where we give an introduction to FHIR, use clinFHIR, and create a simple app to demonstrate how resources and operations are used. We try to be very hands-on.</p>",
