From the discussions and from the implementation guide it appears that this layer should be at a covered intermediary(or multiple intermediaries). So is it mandatory that every payer needs to have an intermediary? Or can the intermediary sit with in the payer's network which can accept FHIR resources and transform them into an X12 278 and 275 requests and send them to the payer's edi end point which accepts x12?</p>",
