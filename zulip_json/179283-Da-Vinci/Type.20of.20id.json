I am a bit confused with it since there is an id type that should be used for ids <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resource.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resource.html</a></p>\n<p>It seems that the core of this issue is us-core-practitioner profile <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-practitioner.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-practitioner.html</a> that is used as a base type for plannet-Practitioner. When you open the full view for the practitioner you can see that type of id is a string, not the id.</p>\n<p>Does anybody face the same issue? Why does this id override take place?</p>\n<p>P.S.<br>\nThe same issue takes place for other resources such as PractitionerRole, Organization, etc.</p>",
