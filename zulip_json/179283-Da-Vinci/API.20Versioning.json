Our solution was to change all APIs using the Patient Access base URL to v2.  Going forward anytime we move to a new version with one API we will ensure all other APIs using that same base URL are also moved to that version.  However, this should only occur when there is a breaking change within an IG.  When discussing with this particular 3rd Party Developer they stated there shouldn't be any versioning since there shouldn't be any changes.   We decided to keep versioning of APIs to allow developers the time to adjust to the changes.  How are other payers and 3rd party applications handling API versioning?</p>",
