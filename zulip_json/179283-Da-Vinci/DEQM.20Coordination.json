I saw a commit that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191401\">@Eric Haas</span>  made in Oct last year that increased the section level by one (added a '#') for all sections on several pages. In response to <a href=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=17897\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=17897\">GF#17897</a> I was about to reduce it by one. But I can't figure out why the page titles are sectioned, but only on the build site. For example, <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-deqm/guidance.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-deqm/guidance.html\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-deqm/guidance.html</a> has '2.1' as the title above the ToC. The 2018 Sep version of that page looks like I would expect <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-deqm/2018Sep/STU3/guidance.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-deqm/2018Sep/STU3/guidance.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-deqm/2018Sep/STU3/guidance.html</a>.

Therefore, an individual measure report will not contain data for these data elements. For example, if a CQM has a criterion for “blue eyed patients” and the source system does not capture eye color, then the corresponding report for that patient will missing that observation.</p>\n<p>Whereas individual measure reporting scenario defines this consistent approach to missing data, specifications of CQMs define the logical processing of missing data (e.g., how to classify a patient into various populations in the absence of an eye color observation). In other words, the CQM addresses how it factors in missing data when calculating criteria, and it is the job of the individual measure report to include relevant data that was present in the EHR, and to not include data that was missing from the EHR\"</p>\n<p>This suggests the measure definition defines what to do when the data is  missing and not the profile...which makes sense because the measure author is going to have to deal with the missing data.</p>",
