I was looking further into the Example Use Cases (for example <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-deqm/col.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-deqm/col.html</a>) and was curious if there is a repo or other work available that explores more of the common quality measures? Historically the HEDIS IG (<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/cqframework/hedis-ig/index.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/cqframework/hedis-ig/index.html</a>) documented the common Payer Measures. Any chance anyone is working on expanding the DEQM Example Use Cases and wants to share and/or collaborate? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191359\">@Bryn Rhodes</span>  any thoughts?</p>",
