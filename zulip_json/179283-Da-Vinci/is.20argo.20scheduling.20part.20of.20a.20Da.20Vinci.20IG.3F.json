Is there a Da Vinci project that builds on top of these Argonaut scheduling APIs? Or was the vignette simply capitalizing on this existing profile, in addition to showcasing all the new Da Vinci work?</p>",

I can say that the HIMSS Da Vinci vignette demonstrated the use of a Payer Patient Portal connecting to a Cardiologist's EHR.  The implication (to me) is yes, enterprise-to-enterprise and/or patient-to-enterprise. <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span></p>",
