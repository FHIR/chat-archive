The issue I encountered is for Comprehensive Diabetes Care Measure ,<a href=\"https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/measures/comprehensive-diabetes-care/\">https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/measures/comprehensive-diabetes-care/</a>, there are sub-measures criteria for that. I'd like to indicate in DetectedIssue that the patient needs eye exam or blood test based on measure report. My best option is to use ServiceRequest in 'contained' to indicate it. The other option would be to reference a specific group in Measure but there is no official published Measure for Comprehensive Diabetes Care yet. Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>",
