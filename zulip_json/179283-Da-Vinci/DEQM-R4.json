I have several questions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what should the repro name and package name be?  ( repro:  davinci-deqm-r4?  package  fhir.davinci.deqm.r4 ?)</li>\n<li>But how will the links resolve before and  after publishing when Grahame does his magic. - I think this means they are they dependent on each other?  In DEQM, I am referencing  3 different guides * 2 versions  +  2 different versions of the spec = 8 different igs and specs using page level variables in the front-matter.  I can manage that manually but I don't think grahame is going to be happy with that arrangement when if comes to publishing .</li>\n<li>I have no idea how this is going to work  for the different published versions of DEQM  - will need to create table.  ( i.e.,  does the current version of DEQM reference the current version of DEQM-R4 ( yes) what about  HEDIS and QICORE ( I think no))</li>\n</ul>",
