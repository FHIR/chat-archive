We're not dealing with the assigning/requesitng piece yet, but we may eventually<br>\n- this is not a procedure that was done on the patient.  It's not something we'd want listed alongside their surgeries, training, physio-therapy, etc.  It's an administrative action, not a Procedure as defined by the scope of the Procedure resource.  (Nor would we want it listed beside vitals, lab results, assessments, etc. as an Observation)<br>\n- Task makes it easy to point to the original medication list (the discharge medications) and the resulting medication list using the <code>input</code> and <code>output</code> elements if we wanted to<br>\n- Task is the resource we would use to contain other \"to dos\" we'd want practitioners to look at - e.g. \"please renew prescription XYZ\", \"please review lab result 123\", \"please cancel order abc\"<br>\n- It's true that argonaut hasn't implemented Task yet, but that's because they've focused on resources that a  primary part of the patient's clinical record.  They haven't dealt with sharing administrative information.  They'd be able to share the reconciled med list, but not that \"reconciliation was requested\" or \"reconciliation occurred\".<br>\n- Task captures the necessary elements including what was done, what encounter it was done for, who did it, when, etc.<br>\n- Task.code can capture CPT codes too if that's what we decide to standardize on.  None of the resources have any constraints on what terminologies can be used<br>\n- We've indicated that we want to identify the \"proper\" resource for R4 and then back-track as necessary for previous versions or to reflect limitations of what systems are willing to do.  It seems pretty clear to me that Task is the \"proper\" resource.</p>",

Different solutions/approaches may map best to Procedure (using CPT perhaps) or Observation (using SNOMED perhaps) or Encounter (using a flap perhaps) or a List (using status/presence perhaps).  Others may have used an approach that uses another resource.  Each of these can be aggregated towards a measure without having to first map everything to one resource (e.g., Procedure) as that would create unnatural/unnecessary transformations.

He is not looking for any electronic trail of the discharge meds list, etc, he wants a hard copy medical record, so I need to know which location to call and get that record. The fact that the medication reconciliation was done in an inpatient setting doesn't necessarily disqualify it from meeting the measure specs for compliance, but the documentation it was done MUST be in the outpatient record. I know this sense of the \"physical location of a hard copy medical record\" gets fuzzy for our health systems that use the same EHR in the inpatient and outpatient settings, so I hope that was clear.</p>",

The  short version of the original use-case was \"When a medication reconciliation has been completed, if the reconciliation is relevant under the \"30 day medication reconciliation\" rule based on past recent admission, the EMR will send a notification to the relevant provider. \" That's since been broadened to \"When information has been collected that's relevant to a particular quality measure, that information will be forwarded to the aggregator responsible for calculating that quality measure\".  The trick is that different EMRs (and even different instances of the same EMR) may have small or large differences in how they represent the measure information internally.  My proposal is to use CDS Hooks to bridge that gap.  The hooks would link into the workflow and query data as relevant for that EMR and would generate 'standard' notifications for the aggregators</p>",
