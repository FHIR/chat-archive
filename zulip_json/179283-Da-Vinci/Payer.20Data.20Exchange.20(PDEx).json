Health Plans may historically have referred to these individual members as:<br>\nMember<br>\nSubscriber<br>\nBeneficiary<br>\nDependent<br>\nGroup Member<br>\nPlan Member<br>\nCovered Party<br>\nSubject of Care\"<br>\nHowever, these IDs are not consistently used across product lines (i.e., Medicaid, Medicare, commercial). For example, Beneficiary usually refers solely to the CMS assigned Medicare ID, and this can be used concurrently with a unique HP member ID. Commercial members usually roll up to subscriber with a dependent ID suffix, and can change if there is a family status change (e.g., divorce) and there is no reference to Medicaid ID, which is commonly used by Medicaid plans as the unique identifier.</p>",
