        "content": "<p>Hi, Paul. We have an internal use case in the Population Health Management space where we provide gaps in care operations to our clients, but with override capability so that they can tweak parameters of the care gap definition to fit the clients needs. Typically, these are things like patient age threshholds, lab threshholds, etc. This adds a lack of precision in the measure report because it isn't possible to know exactly which measure logic was applied without knowing parameter values, so we also added a place in the MeasureReport to store the parameter override values. All the current extension details are in the <a href=\"https://alvearie.io/alvearie-fhir-ig/index.html\">Alvearie FHIR IG</a> definitions. The folks that own that process are <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"285362\">@Stuart Cox</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"312728\">@Kimberly Kenna</span> and can speak better to the specific client needs as needed. I don't believe any of those profiles extended from Davinci profiles right now. There were conversations about it, but the work was deferred. So, if the question is do <strong>we</strong> need it from Davinci, the answer is no. If the question is whether or not we think it is a good idea to add those, then the answer is yes.</p>",

You make a good point about having the returned resources contain some indication of the input parameters used to create it.  If we can do something to make it easier to extend DEQM IG profiles in your IG, let us know.</p>",
