Based on <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-deqm/gaps-in-care-reporting.html#:~:text=A%20report%20calculated,of%E2%80%9D%20previous%20dates.\">this statement in the IG</a>, it seems like the periodStart and periodEnd only serve to identify prospective (current year) vs retrospective (any prior year) measures. The MeasureReport and DetectedIssue resources returned for a retrospective measure would be the same regardless of what month and date is passed in the period dates as long as the year part is the prior year. So the FHIR server could have a single instance of each MeasureReport per patient per measure per year and keep updating its \"group\" element as new evidence is evaluated. However, a MeasureReport for a group of patients would need to be put together on the fly based on the data in each patient's persisted MeasureReport. Does my understanding align or oppose the intent of the IG? Given that our current evaluation of evidence to determine measure outcomes and care gaps happens in commercial third-party software that runs on scheduled batch cycles, we can't technically do on-the-fly calculations anyway. At least not until the FHIR server is fed with CQL for each measure.</p>",
