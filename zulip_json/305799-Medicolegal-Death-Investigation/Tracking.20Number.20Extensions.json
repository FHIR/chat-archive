If not, is the 15075 equivalent to our edrs file number and if so, does this mean the examples are updates to an existing case within the edrs system as opposed to a new case?</p>",

So Yes, I think having an example that shows this binding would be very helpful. And the the valueSet system has three options to choose (refer to <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mdi-ig/ValueSet-ValueSet-tracking-number-type.html#expansion\">https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mdi-ig/ValueSet-ValueSet-tracking-number-type.html#expansion</a>).</p>\n<p>And, it wouldn't be a bad idea to restrict the values to this binding.</p>",
