Here's an example:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Error @ Bundle.entry[0].resource.ofType(Composition).subject (line 36, col56) : Unable to find matching profile for Patient/2019++05806 among choices: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/fhir-vr-common-ig/StructureDefinition/Patient-child\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Are these errors safe to ignore? Will those links be added in time? Are the links to the profile definition incorrect? Thanks!</p>",

In the live birth jurisdiction bundle (and possibly others), the Organization's identifier system is: \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org.fhir/sid/us-npi\">http://hl7.org.fhir/sid/us-npi</a>\", which I am guessing should be identical to the Practitioner's identifier system: \"<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-npi\">http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-npi</a>\" (note one is \"org/fhir\", one is \"org.fhir\"). I adjusted my code to work around it, but just wanted to get that cleared up - thanks!</p>",
