The lhncbc/fhirpath.js repository will be deleted and recreated as a fork of HL7/fhirpath.js.  I will work on copying issues from the old repository to the HL7 one; unfortunately there seems to be no way to directly transfer issues between the two \"organizations\".  Also, the latest two GitHub \"releases\" (counting the new one that I will announce below) have been published on HL7/fhirpath.js, but I am not planning to re-publish the earlier ones, although they could be recreated if needed.</p>",
