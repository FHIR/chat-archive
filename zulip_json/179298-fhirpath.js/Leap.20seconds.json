In particular, \"60\" is now allowed as a value for seconds, and ideally one would have 00:00:59 &lt; 00:00:60 &lt; 00:01:00 .   JavaScript does not like 60 as a value for seconds, and seems to have no support for leap seconds in general.  I am thinking about just replacing \"60\" with \"59\" when I see it.</p>",
