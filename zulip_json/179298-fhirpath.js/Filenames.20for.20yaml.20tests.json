I think I started that practice initially, but then I found that the section numbers can change from one version of FHIRPath to the next.   (Compare <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhirpath/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhirpath/\">http://hl7.org/fhirpath/</a> with <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhirpath/2018Sep/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhirpath/2018Sep/\">http://hl7.org/fhirpath/2018Sep/</a> and you will see a new section \"7\", among other changes.  So, in my last pull request I removed the section numbers.</p>\n<p>I am assuming that in general the master branch of fhirpath.js will be the latest version of FHIRPath we support, and we can tag a particular commit with a FHIRPath version number (and document it) so people can continue processing old FHIRPath if necessary.</p>",
