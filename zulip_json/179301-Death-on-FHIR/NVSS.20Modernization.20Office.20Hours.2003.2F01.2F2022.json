We are dotting the i's and crossing the t's on the VRDR IG, so its current state should be very close to the version published as STU2.   There has been significant addition of documentation.  See for example the <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/vrdr/branches/master/StructureDefinition-vrdr-decedent.html#usage\">Decedent profile</a>.<br>\nWe expect a release of IGs and associated software around mid April 2022.   </p>\n<p>We invite your feedback on the latest builds of the two IGs.</p>",

Note that the new proposed date for the NCHS testing event is June 27-28th (and not May 16-17th, 2022) This is to give jurisdictions and their vendors more time to update their systems and work with the tools leading upto to the testing event. NCHS will organize TA calls with jurisdictions that want to participate in the June testing event approximately 4 weeks prior. If you would like to participate, please send an email to <a href=\"mailto:nvssmodernization@cdc.gov\">nvssmodernization@cdc.gov</a></p>",
