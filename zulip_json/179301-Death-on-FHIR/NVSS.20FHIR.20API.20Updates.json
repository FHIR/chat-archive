If you continue to use the \"lastUpdated\" parameter, the time based filtering will not be applied.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The API server has been updated to resolve the timezone bug. If you use the <code>_since</code> parameter and provide a timestamp, you will receive all response messages created after that timestamp.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
