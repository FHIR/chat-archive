However, we have not tested against canary yet, so I have labelled the release as \"BETA\" to denote that there could be some validation errors to come. If you find any issues, feel free to email me directly, or create an issue on the github project here: <a href=\"https://github.com/gt-health/VRDR_javalib/issues/new\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/gt-health/VRDR_javalib/issues/new\">https://github.com/gt-health/VRDR_javalib/issues/new</a> I'll receive the issue, and will resolve it with you.</p>",
