The issues address in this release are related to the testcases tested during connecatathon, so updating is encouraged. However, it mainly just addresses helper functions that are optional to use, so if you're comforatable with your release right now or are locked in to a previous version for connectathon, that should be fine as well. <a href=\"https://github.com/MortalityReporting/VRDR_javalib/releases/tag/v1.2.2-R4-STU1.2\">https://github.com/MortalityReporting/VRDR_javalib/releases/tag/v1.2.2-R4-STU1.2</a></p>",
