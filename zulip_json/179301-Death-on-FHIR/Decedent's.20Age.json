Here's what I wrote there: I believe we've addressed it via a pull request to the .NET libraries (which Canary uses): <a href=\"https://github.com/nightingaleproject/vrdr-dotnet/pull/165\">https://github.com/nightingaleproject/vrdr-dotnet/pull/165</a>. Once the team has reviewed and merged this change and updated Canary to use the updated .NET library this will be included in the next release of Canary.</p>",
