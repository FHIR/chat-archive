Should we use Birth Record Identifier or Patient for these elements?</p>",

There was a comment made about it during balloting, so I'd expect it will be fixed (<a href=\"https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=20713&amp;start=0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=20713&amp;start=0\">https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=20713&amp;start=0</a>). The UML diagram above actually lists ISO 3166-1 as the code system instead, but I think that is also incorrect, as I'd expect something more like ISO 3166-2 (3166-1 is country level, 3166-2 is state/province level). For now, the way I am using the \"Birth Record Identifier\" resource is by just populating the valueString as the Decedent's Birth Certificate number (if available) - I think it is acceptable to only worry about that for now, and update as the IG changes in future.</p>",

In my opinion, a valueString is good enough for country/state name, it should be up to the implementer to map it to their data element.</p>",

        "content": "<p>That's definitely a great point, but I think that case is captured correctly by having the birthPlace extension on the Decedent profile (which is a FHIR Address, not a CodableConcept - which doesn't limit you to a USA or Canada place of birth). My understanding of the \"Birth Place Identifier\" profile is really to try to map the record back to a state birth certificate (if the decedent even has one, so you can think of the entire resource as optional). Perhaps a bit of context may help for understanding the difference between what's already on Decedent and what is represented by Birth Place Identifier: it is essentially a FHIR version of what is captured by fields 88 (Infant Death/Birth Linking - birth certificate number), 89 (Infant Death/Birth Linking - year of birth), and 90 (Infant Death/Birth Linking - State, U.S. Territory or Canadian Province of Birth - code) in the IJE mortality format.</p>",

The terminology binding for BirthRecordIdentifier.BirthState.valueCodeableConcept will be modified to be code system ISO 3155-2. It designates any one of the 50 states, 1 district, or 6 outlying areas that comprise the United States of America. This is the jurisdiction that assigned the referenced birth record identifier. It is used for US-issued birth records only.  Place of birth makes use of the birthPlace extension defined by the VRDR IG. However, consideration is being given to dropping the extension and instead slicing patient.address to include a birth address slice.</p>",
