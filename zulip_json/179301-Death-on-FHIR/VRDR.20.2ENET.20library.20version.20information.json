Hopefully the following guidance (which we'll be adding to our documentation) is helpful:</p>\n<p>General guidance for .NET versions: To check wether your .NET version supports a release, refer to this .NET matrix <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support</a> First, note whether you are using .NET Core or .NET Framework - see here for distinctions between the .NET implementation options <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/september/net-standard-demystifying-net-core-and-net-standard\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/september/net-standard-demystifying-net-core-and-net-standard</a> Once youâ€™ve determined your .NET implementation type and version, for example you are using .NET Framework 4.6.1, refer to the matrix to verify whether your .NET implementation supports the targeted .NET Standard version. By looking at the matrix, you can see for instance that .NET Framework 4.6.1 supports .NET Standard 2.0 so the tool would be supported.</p>",

        "content": "<p>In the VRDR .NET library, for fields that require a dictionary to be passed when specifying a code (such as Marital Status) the code, display, and system fields all need to be set. The system field can typically be determined by looking at the value set bound to the field in the IG, but figuring out the correct value for the system string can sometimes be challenging. We do currently have helper methods for some fields that used to be booleans (e.g. ResidenceWithinCityLimitsBoolean) that automatically set the code system; we'll investigate how practical it is to add helper methods for other coded fields in order to remove the burden of having to determine the code system.</p>",
