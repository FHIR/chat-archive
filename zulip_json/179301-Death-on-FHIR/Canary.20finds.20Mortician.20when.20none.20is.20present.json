Where is Canary getting the \"Sam Jones, MD\" information that it's displaying? Is there perhaps some field name overlap, since \"Sam Jones, MD\" appears as a name in other parts of the file? <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/KRe9Pcr90-pU8garxj7kjwU4/Janet_Page_86759-20210528-fhir-1.json\">Janet_Page_86759-20210528-fhir-1.json</a></p>",
