You can find the new versioning here. <a href=\"https://github.com/MortalityReporting/VRDR_javalib/releases/tag/v1.2.0-R4-STU1.2\">https://github.com/MortalityReporting/VRDR_javalib/releases/tag/v1.2.0-R4-STU1.2</a></p>\n<p>Note: as a rule going forward we are going to practice a version scheme of \"v&lt;source_version&gt;-&lt;fhir_version&gt;-&lt;ig_version&gt;\" and we will try to mirror the source_version and ig_version when possible.</p>",
