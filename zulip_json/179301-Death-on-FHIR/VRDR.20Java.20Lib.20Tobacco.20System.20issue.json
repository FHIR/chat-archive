We moved to oid representation of snomed/loinc where applied by the IG and support what the IG states as much as possible. It's unclear where the guide is unintended on these valuesets vs intentional, so it's hard to deviate from what the guide states.</p>\n<p>Looking at this issue specifically, it's VRDR_Javalib that is wrong for sure.</p>",

The PHINVADS OID, and the correct HL7 defining URL (for things like DeathCertificateDocument.code).    Given this ambiguity, Canary  and VRDR .NET library consistently refers to SNOMEDCT by the HL7-sanctioned codesystem defining URL.</p>",
