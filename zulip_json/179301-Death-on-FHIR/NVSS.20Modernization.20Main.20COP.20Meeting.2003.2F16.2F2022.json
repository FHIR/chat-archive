Canary is primarily for learning FHIR and validating if your system can produce valid FHIR records. It also provides context and examples of data in the IJE format compared to FHIR. It was built with the EDRS to NCHS data exchange in mind</p>\n<p>Raven is a reference implementation of a medical examiner/coroner case management system. Its not a vendor system but a testing and training system. It is used by  those without a Medical Examiner/Coroner Case Management System for getting FHIR into their workflow. But not intended to replace a case management system. It will help with the lift when testing the IG quite easily. You can deploy to your environment with help from GTRI or with your IT<br>\nRaven happens to be more expansive for handing case information using VRDR IG and MDI IG (also to be in similar structure to a case management system which helps with testing and training).  GTRI is building additional features that will have similar testing components in Raven as Canary does (ie. A validator). Raven is Free. Itâ€™s open source. </p>\n<p><strong>2. Does canary testing validate all FHRI standards including cross validations?</strong> </p>\n<p>It does not validate the content against the standard in the IG but checks the format. There are test files to validate the content but it is limited to those particular test cases.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What are our testing options outside of canary for other validations?</strong></p>",
