I thought that all instances of Entered in Error should have similar definitions. Same for Cancelled. Shouldn't definitions be worded as consistently as possible? </p>\n<p>To take a better look at consistency, I added the entries for the various Status CodeSystems found in my three docs to a spreadsheet to look and see their consistency for Codes, Display, and Definition. </p>\n<p>I emailed David Hay about this.
