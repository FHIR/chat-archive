With patient identity, demographic information, race and ethnicity, and clinical diagnoses, it presents the necessary case data needed for state, local, and federal public health agencies (PHAs) to manage cases, provide patient situational awareness, support reporting, enable contact tracing, as well as to coordinate isolation and other response measures. eCR can contain point of care and local lab results from clinical care sites as well as connect with electronic laboratory results when they arrive at PHAs.</p>\n<p>Trigger codes and case definitions to support eCR have been authored by state and local PHA staff and are being rapidly updated as they change during the course of the outbreak. In addition to automatic reporting without disruption of provider workflow when a diagnosis or problem list item is recorded, eCR can be triggered from laboratory and medication orders. As such, while eCR is faster and more complete than ELR natively, cases can also be generated on suspicion before a result is even achieved.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Context</p>\n<p>Electronic case reporting (eCR) involves “the automated identification of reportable health events in electronic health records and their transmission to state and local public health authorities for review and action.” Reporting is a legal requirement for COVID-19 and many other conditions, but the specific laws vary by state. Triggering case reports out of EHRs does not, by itself, definitively establish that something is reportable or which public health agencies should receive it if it is.</p>\n<p>To address the complexity of reporting requirements, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) have implemented shared eCR services on the APHL AIMS platform including provisioning, decision support, routing, and delivery infrastructure to provide electronic case reports to public health agencies for integration into their surveillance systems. The eCR Now App is constructed to connect to, and take advantage of, this existing infrastructure to support appropriate reporting even though neither it, nor public health agencies, currently support production HL7 FHIR services.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Integration Points</p>\n<p>The eCR Now App is intended to run as a background process during patient encounters, report automatically to appropriate public health jurisdictions though the APHL AIMS shared service infrastructure, and not disrupt healthcare provider workflows. On the EHR side, the App is built to leverage the work of the Argonaut Project, HL7, and ONC that has implemented a level of FHIR API that is now in implemented EHRs. As such, the App is both enabled and restricted by the status of that API. The areas of:</p>\n<p>obtaining patient and encounter context;<br>\nlaunching the background app process;<br>\nobtaining up-to-date trigger codes and parameters from the electronic Reporting and Distribution (eRSD) system;<br>\nimplementing specific trigger and loading queries;<br>\ntransporting electronic Initial Case Reports (eICRs) out to the APHL AIMS platform;<br>\nlocal storage of eICRs that have been sent;<br>\nreceipt, processing, and local storage of the Reportability Response that comes back to the EHR for each eICR that has been sent;<br>\nall require consideration as integration points with other EHR infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Some of these integration points are well developed and essentially complete in the App that is being developed such as accessing up-to-date trigger codes from the eRSD system and some of them will require additional EHR activities and teaming with the eCR Now team.</p>\n<p>Teaming and Release Process</p>\n<p>The eCR Now App is being developed with the intent of sharing, with its source code, for implementation by EHR vendors and other implementors. The planned schedule represents phased delivery and hand-off to implementors over the course of May 2020. The following draft schedule may be subject to change in accordance with shared refinement and development priorities:</p>\n<p>eCR Now App Schedule</p>\n<p>First Release (Pre-Alpha) - May 1, 2020<br>\nSecond Release (Alpha-Pre-Connectathon) - May 8, 2020<br>\nImplementor testing in HL7 Connectathon Public Health Track – May 13-15, 2020<br>\nThird Release (Post-Connectathon) – by May 29, 2020</p>",
