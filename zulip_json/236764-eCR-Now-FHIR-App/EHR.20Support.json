So, I believe the app will be pushed on Cerner  App Gallery soon. But what about Epic, eCW, Allscripts, Meditech, etc? Is there a plan to push the app for the respective EHR vendor app store as well? If yes, Do you have a timeline of when you see that happening? Thanks</p>",

Are you aware of others who do as well or are close to doing so?</p>",
