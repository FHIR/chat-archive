I know there was talk of integrating CONNECT with eCR Now for this purpose but I'm not sure if you would package CONNECT with eCR Now?  If a package with CONNECT is the approach, maybe Docker could be used to bundle the two?<br>\nFor reference, the eHealth Exchange specification: <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/seqprojectehex/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/28215240/nhin-document-submission-production-specification-v2-0-a.pdf\">https://s3.amazonaws.com/seqprojectehex/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/28215240/nhin-document-submission-production-specification-v2-0-a.pdf</a><br>\nThanks,<br>\nMike</p>",
