Simplifier is great and allows to list resource definitions, extensions, etc. on various FHIR servers , but it doesn't help solve one of the issues we face. </p>\n<p>If we follow the advise of using a resolvable NamingSystem for URLs of our identifiers and code systems, we need a stable FHIR server, which is not going to change in the future, e.g. something like <a href=\"http://fhir.ontario.ca/NamingSystem/ca-hc-din\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhir.ontario.ca/NamingSystem/ca-hc-din\">fhir.ontario.ca/NamingSystem/ca-hc-din</a>. Unfortunatey, this is not under our control and our FHIR server's base URL is pretty flexible. It's not a problem for posting and getting resources (clients just need to update their configurable base URL), but it creates a real problem with defining permanent URLs to replace OIDs. </p>\n<p>So one option for us is to define permanent URLs for identifiers and jursidictional code systems, which are not tied to a FHIR server and are not resolvable, and to maintain a published list of these URLs, same as we did with the OIDs in the past. Apparently, we are losing the benefit of using URLs over OIDs with this approach. Another option is to find a permanent FHIR server that would allow us register our URLs in its NamingSystem, but I don't see how Simplifier can help with this. </p>",

So it seems to me the NamingSystem approach is the most straight-forward.  The NamingSystem is a useful thing to resolve to because it lets you translate to the OID, lets you identify constraints on the values and can be updated to point to the current \"source of truth\" for the codes, whether the code system is available as a FHIR-defined/published CodeSystem resource or not.</p>",
