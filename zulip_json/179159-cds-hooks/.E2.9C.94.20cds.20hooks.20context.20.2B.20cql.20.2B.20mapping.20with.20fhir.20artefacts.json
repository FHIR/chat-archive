I have not been able to find information about this endpoint and it is cited in one of the tutorials by hl7 as a CDS Service sandbox...</p>\n<p>my second question is, how can I access CDS Hooks Context \"artefacts\" especially regarding order-select hook using CQL code ?</p>\n<p>Thanks for your help</p>",
