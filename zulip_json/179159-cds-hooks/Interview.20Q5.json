In other words, does a CDS Service developer need to translate its logic into a common language that EHRs can execute, or does it just communicate a set of <em>results</em>. CDS Hooks focused on the latter. This open up the possibility for CDS Services that continuously improve, or services that base their decisions on machien learning models, or external data sources like Health Information Exchange databases, or Prescription Drug Monitoring databases. In other words, a CDS Service can execute \"interesting\" logic, but can also join/combine EHR data with other \"interesting\" external sources.</p>",

From our understanding, CDS Hooks is not a solution to the curly braces problem. Instead, it offers a different approach entirely that is able to bypass the “curly braces” because the external CDS systems may use FHIR APIs to obtain any institution/patient specific information. Are we correct in our thinking here?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's exactrly right, as I hope I've highlighted in the prior answer, too. CDS Hooks focuses on standardizing the API call and response, rather than the expression of logic.</p>",
