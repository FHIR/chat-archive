For example, this particular CDS service supports the \"medication-order\" action. A discovery service would expose this metadata via a searchable CDS REST interface and a user-friendly UI.</p>\n<p>If there is interest for such a cds discovery service, we could try and implement a concept version as part of our <a href=\"http://simplifier.net\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://simplifier.net\">http://simplifier.net</a> platform.</p>",
