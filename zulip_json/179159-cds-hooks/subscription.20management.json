If so, there hasn't been any implementation work around FHIR Subscriptions until fairly recently. There is a <a href=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201801_FHIR_Subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201801_FHIR_Subscriptions\">track at the upcoming New Orleans Connectathon</a> that will focus on Subscriptions. Though I'm not aware of the details around access, authentication, and status of Subscriptions, my guess is that there would not be anything unique to CDS Services (as compared to other systems interested in Subscriptions)</p>",
