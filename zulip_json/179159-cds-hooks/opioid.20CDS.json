In particular, I am wondering if there is a way for me to see which systems already implement/use <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/cqframework/opioid-cds/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/cqframework/opioid-cds/\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/cqframework/opioid-cds/</a> and if there is any research/evidence about the success of the system in yielding better prescriptions in places it has launched. I see that at least UW and Swedish hospitals have FHIR endpoints already -- curious if they are being used and if so for what purposes (e.g., <a href=\"https://fhir.epic.medical.washington.edu/FHIR-Proxy/api/FHIR/DSTU2/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://fhir.epic.medical.washington.edu/FHIR-Proxy/api/FHIR/DSTU2/\">https://fhir.epic.medical.washington.edu/FHIR-Proxy/api/FHIR/DSTU2/</a>).
