Since most all EHRs support the patient-view hook you may want to start there for testing at the Connectathon. Writing a Clinical Note can be done currently without the SMART Web Messaging using the DocumentReference resource and targeting an existing patient. Our EHR is focusing on using the SMART Web Messaging for in-progress items like orders that have not been placed yet. At the connectathon our EHR will be able to receive and display the SMART Web Messages. So we could test whichever approach you wanted to pursue.</p>",

If for the purposes of the connectathon, you wanted to start with patient-view, that'd be a broadly supported hook.  Depending on the use-case, if you're wanting to write back a clinical note, you'd do that by either returning it as a suggestion in your service's card, or your service would write the note itself w/o user interaction.  <a href=\"https://fhir.cerner.com/millennium/dstu2/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://fhir.cerner.com/millennium/dstu2/\">Here</a>'s a link to Cerner's FHIR sandbox if you want to peruse it, as well as <a href=\"https://fhir.cerner.com/millennium/dstu2/infrastructure/document-reference/#create\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://fhir.cerner.com/millennium/dstu2/infrastructure/document-reference/#create\">DocumentReference</a> details.</p>",
