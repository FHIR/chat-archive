For example, for discharge-view, I'd like to assert that the only contexts needed are patient id and encounter id.  What's the correct way to have such a discussion?  Just edit the hook?  Add an alternative version of the same hook?  Add discussion to the wiki page?  Discuss things here?  Something else?</p>",
