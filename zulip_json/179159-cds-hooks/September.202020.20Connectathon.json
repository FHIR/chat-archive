The <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2020-09+CDS+Hooks+Track\">CDS Hooks Track</a> contains the usual scenarios around 1.0 specification integrations, but also scenarios around 1.1 candidate functionality.  With the CDS Hooks 1.1 ballot (<a href=\"https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/ballots/2020Sep/index.html\">content snapshot</a>) running 8/14-9/14, this is a great opportunity to try implementing what's proposed so that good feedback can be provided.</p>\n<p>Head over to HL7's <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/events/fhir/connectathon/2020/09/\">registration page</a> to formally sign up for the event.  Additionally, we'll continue using a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/cds-hooks-connectathon-tracking\">Google Spreadsheet</a> to coordinate clients and servers, so please start indicating your intention to participate out there (and details later when you have them).</p>",
