Overall, FHIR's RequestGroup is very powerful, but it also introduces a lot of complexity as well as a dependence upon STU3. </p>\n<p>How to pragmatically and simply incorporate the best parts of RequestGroup into CDS Hooks, while also allowing for compatibility with this FHIR resource? Here's the direction that @brynrhodes, @kpshek, and myself landed on:</p>\n<p>An array of actions should be added to the CDS Hooks suggestion, such that a card can return multiple suggestions, of which the user can select one. Each suggestion contains a list of actions. When a user selects a suggestion that contains multiple actions, the user is selecting all of the actions within that suggestion. Here's what this looks like in json:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>“suggestions”: [\n  // EHRs should render suggestions to the user as\n  // ANY suggestion can be selected\n  {\n    “uuid”: “abc1238hdf87sh”,\n    “label”: “Add &amp; remove”,\n    “actions”: [\n     // Actions are ANDed together\n     {\n      “type”: “create”,\n      “description”: “Add this new order for X”,\n      “resource”: { resource X }\n     },\n     {\n      “type”: “delete”,\n      “description”: “Cancel the existing order”,\n      “resource”: “MedicationRequest/123”\n     }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    “uuid”: “n9d89hsdg8h”,    \n    “label”: “Modify warfarin”,\n    “actions”: [\n     {\n      “type”: “modify”,\n      “description”: “Change warfarin dosage to 10mg/day”,\n    “resource”: &quot;MedicationRequest/abc&quot;\n     }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Note that each suggestion is implicitly OR’d and that the actions within a suggestion are AND’d. This intentionally does not support the additional feature and complexity of Clinical Reasoning’s RequestGroup selectionBehavior. Additionally each suggestion is implicitly a “visual-group” in the same way as Clinical Reasoning's RequestGroup’s groupingBehavior.</p>\n</blockquote>",

In the implementation I'm working on at athenaHealth, we are using a combination of create and delete to describe a modification to the order (e.g delete a specified order and create an identical order with modifications to it). I like how the RequestGroup resource allows for the updates to be explicitly described.</p>\n<p>In the FHIR <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-action-type.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-action-type.html\">action-type</a> documentation, it mentions RequestGroup action types of _create_, _remove_, _update_, and _fire-event_. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do we want the naming scheme to match FHIR?</li>\n<li>Would the cds-hooks spec support the _fire-event_ action type?</li>\n<li>What might some _fire-event_ use cases be?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",

Each suggestion includes list of changes (the things that are \"AND'd together\" in the form of <code>create</code> + <code>delete</code> arrays), which correspond to the <code>actions</code> array you're describing. On a quick read, it seems like the only difference is whether these arrays are merged into a single \"actions\" array (with the create-vs-delete distinction bubbling down into a property on the actions).</p>\n<p>In terms of the use cases you'd want to make sure we support, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"isaacvetter@gmail.com\" data-user-id=\"558\">@Isaac Vetter</span>, can you highlight the gap?</p>\n<p>(Also, I should say: we could of course just add a <code>modify</code> array next to our current <code>create</code> + <code>delete</code> — but I originally figured that it was clearer to let the EHR manage the question of whether to preserve or reassign ids, and just let the service express a modify as create-and-delete. Are there more kinds of actions besides create/delete/modify that you'd want to make sure we can handle, which would steer us toward the more generic model?)</p>\n</blockquote>",
