        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191315\">@Josh Mandel</span> this is great. I'm fine changing the response from CDS Hooks actions to FHIR operations since it'll accomplish the same thing. The only issue I can see is the need to have some guarantees about which FHIR operations will be supported. In other words, if an EMR has a CDS Hooks implementation which supports actions for add/create/update order, CDS service should be able to assume that the same implementation will support FHIR update/create/delete for unsigned orders as well.</p>",

No strong feelings on config vs. runtime, both could be useful depending on context.<br>\n- You're right in that we can't guarantee which actions are supported by an EMR. That said, if an EMR <em>does</em> support a specific action (like add order) then we should be able to depend on it also supporting the same operation via FHIR. So, it's really symmetry I'm after.</p>",
