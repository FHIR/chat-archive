You recently posted on GitHub that decisions and the redirect field will be excluded from release 1.0 (<a href=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/116\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/116\">https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/116</a>). The official documentation now has a \"1.0\" sub-section, which still references decisions and redirect. (e.g. <a href=\"http://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/#redirect\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/#redirect\">http://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/#redirect</a>) <br>\nCould you clarify what the guidance is around that? The redirect seems to be required in order for the CDS service to notify the EHR that the interaction is done and the EHR can ask for the results.</p>",
