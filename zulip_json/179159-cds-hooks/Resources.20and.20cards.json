For example, suppose an app allows a Practitioner to create a MedicationRequest proposal for a patient; the CDS service could do dosage calculations for the patient and return a MedicationRequest plan with details filled out (which the Practitioner could then choose to turn into an order, or not).  In the Card model, that's not possible, correct?  Also, out of curiosity, why aren't Cards FHIR Resources?</p>",
