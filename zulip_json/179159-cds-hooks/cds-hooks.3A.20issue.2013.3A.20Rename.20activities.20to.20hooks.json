This is because it's awkward to say \"CDS Services offers services...\"<br>\n- Hooks, not activities (see above). Activities imply user action and certainly today our hooks are invoked as a result of explicit user action. However, I'm certain we'll see hooks in the future which are purely passive (eg, the EHR offers a hook into an *area* of the application that is always visible; like a notification bar / system tray)</p>\n<p>This terminology would have the following ramifications:</p>\n<p>- POST /$cds-service for invoking a service in the CDS Provider<br>\n- GET /$cds-service-metadata to get the metadata for all services offered by the CDS Provider</p>\n<p>Thoughts <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"jmandel@gmail.com\">@Josh Mandel</span>?</p>\n</blockquote>",
