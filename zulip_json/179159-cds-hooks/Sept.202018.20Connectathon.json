The default CDS Hooks sandbox FHIR server only returns \"use\" and \"value\" for the identifier (and sometimes not even that). We need to identify the user appropriately for future downstream authorization and patient privacy related aspects.</li>\n<li>Will the EMRs attending support changing the user for the testing? E.g. so different users are presented in the CDS hooks that are published? We've got a PR up for changing the CDS Hooks sandbox to support this.</li>\n<li>What resources will the vendors have data for? We're currently looking to use Allergies, Conditions, Procedures, MedicationOrder, MedicationStatement. Which of those resource would support prefetch vs post fetch.</li>\n<li>What JWK signing certs will be used. We ran into an issue with our JWKS library not supporting ES key types which we're still to resolve.</li>\n</ul>",

The original service without dynamic content is now at <a href=\"https://fhir.cygni.cc/opencds-2/hooks/cds-services\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://fhir.cygni.cc/opencds-2/hooks/cds-services\">https://fhir.cygni.cc/opencds-2/hooks/cds-services</a>.  Would appreciate input on whether the service works or does not work in an EHR.  P.S. these services are CDC-sponsored, there is ongoing funding for further development, and are available free and open-source.  They also support average MME (vs. only the max MME typically supported), as well as natural language processing of free-text Sigs (affects ~20% of opioids at our institution). Thanks! Ken</p>",
