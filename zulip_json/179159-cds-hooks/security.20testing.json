(I haven't implemeted the JWT yet). Here's the version of the CDS Hooks spec that I'm following: <a href=\"https://cds-hooks-docs-pr-72.herokuapp.com/#fhir-resource-access\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://cds-hooks-docs-pr-72.herokuapp.com/#fhir-resource-access\">https://cds-hooks-docs-pr-72.herokuapp.com/#fhir-resource-access</a></p>\n<p>I implemented a dummy client_id of \"6c12dff4-24e7-4475-a742-b08972c4ea27\" that any CDS service  can use. </p>\n<p>Anybody interested in testing pre-connectathon? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191581\">@Kalyani Yerra</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191644\">@Raj M</span> ? Shoot me a pm.</p>\n<p>p.s. Everybody that I've been testing with via Argonauts is already getting the fhirAuthorization in my request  as of a 1/2 hour ago.</p>",
