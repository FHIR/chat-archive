Our patient-view hooks service responds with applicable pathways (as app link cards) for users to interact with based on the patient context. The use case we wanted to try out is as a CDS service provider, present bunch of app link cards (with out suggestions - example below) and let user override the same if they think that the app link card is not applicable</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>{\n  &quot;cards&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;indicator&quot;: &quot;info&quot;,\n      &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;UpToDate® suggests Osteoporosis and osteopenia: Initial management in postmenopausal women&quot;,\n      &quot;detail&quot;: &quot;This UpToDate Pathway will help guide clinicians in the initial management of low bone mass (bone mineral density T-score &amp;lt; -1.0) in postmenopausal women.
