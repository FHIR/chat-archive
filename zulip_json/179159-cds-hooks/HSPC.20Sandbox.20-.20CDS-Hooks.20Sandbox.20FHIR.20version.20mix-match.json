Interesting enough, if we ask for a MedicationOrder resource in the prefetch,<br>\nwe get an error, which is correct, stating MedicationOrder is not supported.  This seems<br>\nlike a bug in one of the Sandboxes.  Is that correct or is this expected behavior?</p>",

I can log an issue for this soon here, and you can track it on this page <a href=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/sandbox/issues\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/sandbox/issues\">https://github.com/cds-hooks/sandbox/issues</a>. Thanks for catching this!</p>",
