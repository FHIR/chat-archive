The reason why I ask is because by making CDS Hooks fit into the FHIR design, it affects several things: the URI ($cds-hook), request/response (Parameters resource), and advertising capabilities via Conformance. While I understand the desire &amp; value to communicate prefetched data as FHIR resources (I agree this is a good thing), I'm struggling to understand the value in coupling the rest of the CDS Hooks design with FHIR's model/design.</p>",

SMART apps have the exact same need as DecisionSupportModules with respect to declaring the FHIR resources and attributes they need.</p>\n<p>With SMART, there is no declarative model for this information; rather, this information is communicated in documentation or verbally between the EHR and app. In spite of this, SMART has flourished and as someone who has spent a lot of time working on integrating many different SMART apps into my EHR, I can say that this lack of declarative model has not been a hinderance to our implementation or adoption of SMART.</p>\n<p>However, with CDS on FHIR, they are trying to model these data requirements declaratively. While that is an admirable goal, I don't see it as being required and think that successful adoption is predicated on having such a declaractive model. One of my concerns with CDS on FHIR is this declarative model and it's complexity for implementors.</p>\n<p>What does this have to do with CDS Hooks? I like that this isn't a strict requirement right now on the prefetching of data. I think CDS Hooks will be adopted and successful without such a model. And, since you were in the last quarter on this topic, Josh, I thought you might be interested in this analogy.</p>",
