I would imagine if we did it would require extra implementation on the client side.</p>\n<p>The basic flow of events would be something like:<br>\nWhen a patient is about to have a medication administered<br>\nThe clinician starts the administration process<br>\nOnce the administration details are entered the application triggers the hook to process CDS<br>\nThe hook services check for issues with the administration e.g. overdose/underdose and sends cards back to the client.</p>",

The <a href=\"https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/1.0/#hook-maturity-model\">Hook Maturity Model</a> in the CDS Hooks spec describes the process for proposing and maturing hook definitions, I'd suggest writing up a hook definition with the proposed workflow there and submitting that as a PR for folks to comment on.</p>",
