For PAMA, CDS-hooks would not only need to communicate an appropriateness score for an existing order, but would also need to provide suggestions with better appropriateness scores. One way that this could be achieved within in the hooks standard to support PAMA as well as many other things is by introducing the _data_ field (naming suggestions are welcome).</p>\n<p><code>data: An array of JSONs or FHIR resources that provide additional information in a software consumable format</code></p>\n<p>To support PAMA, the data field would probably need to be added to the card top-level as well as individual suggestions. I think such a field would also make sense in the context of links and decisions as well.</p>\n<p>For individual cards:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>{\n    summary: &#39;PAMA Suggestions&#39;,\n    indicator: &#39;info&#39;,\n    data: [\n        // This is an example of what data could look like,\n        // not a proposal of what it should look like\n        {\n            type: &#39;PAMA Appropriateness Score&#39;,  // identifies what kind of data we are dealing with\n            identifier: FHIRResource/123,  // identifies the order to which the score applies (id or FHIR resource)\n            score: 37\n        }\n    ],\n    suggestions: [ ... ]\n}\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Likewise, for individual suggestions:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>{\n    label: &#39;Replace Order&#39;,\n    uuid: &#39;abc-123&#39;,\n    delete: [ FHIRResource/123 ],\n    create: [ FHIRResource/456 ],\n    data: [\n        // This is an example of what data could look like,\n        // not a proposal of what it should look like\n        {\n            type: &#39;PAMA Appropriateness Score&#39;,\n            identifier: FHIRResource/456,\n            score: 79\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The same could work for links and decisions.</p>\n<p>Introducing a generic 'data' field raises some questions:<br>\n- How do we define what the data looks like?<br>\n    - Is there a standard that we can use within the spec?<br>\n    - Does the hooks community define a bunch of supported data types?<br>\n    - Do EHR and Vendor come up with their data structures outside of the spec?<br>\n- How do we handle different code sets and units of measure?<br>\n- Does a generic data field make sense in the hooks spec?<br>\n    - Does it introduce too much flexibility and uncertainty?<br>\n- In addition to PAMA, what else could this field be used for?</p>\n</blockquote>",

One more question to add to the pile: what is the \"meaning\" of this kind of <code>data</code>? In other words, what is an EHR expected to do with them? Display them? Log them?
