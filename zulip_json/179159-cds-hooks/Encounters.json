Are they always available when seeing a patient?  Are there scenarios where a clinician might not have an active encounter ?  Are there scenarios where the <code>User</code> will actually be a mid-level or other user who is recording data or acting on behalf of a physician?  If so, how is the attending physician identified?  How do you determine what to fill the <code>reason</code> with?  Are the <code>diagnoses</code> populated?</p>",

Users cannot act on behalf of a physician per se, but might not have the ability to do something until another user (eg, physician) signs off on their action (for instance, ordering certain types of meds). Fields like reason and diagnosis are populated by the user and whether these fields are documented depend upon how the hospital configures their system.</p>",
