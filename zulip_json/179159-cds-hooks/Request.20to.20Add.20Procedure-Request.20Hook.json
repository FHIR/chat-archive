The CDS service modifies the scheduled procedures based on the modified procedure request.<br>\nContextual data: Required Patient, procedure request being created.<br>\n{<br>\n\"name\": \"context\",<br>\n\"resource\": procedurerequest/123;<br>\n}</p>\n<p>1. Patient comes out of an operation and is sent to a nursing care or t home (cost reduction)<br>\n2. Clinician requires scheduled vitals collection hence created procedure request for the vital collection<br>\n3. Above hooks invokes a cloud server, which obtains the details and Timing of the procedure request<br>\n4. The cloud server coordinates with the gateway at home to collect the Vitals.</p>\n<p>We look forward to your comments.</p>\n<p>Copied here  from: <a href=\"https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/search/proposed.20hook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/search/proposed.20hook\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/search/proposed.20hook</a></p>",
