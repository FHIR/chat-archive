Yet in the data model in Swagger, it is specified as an array of Objects. In my implementation I chose to follow the second approach as I would like to provide a list of valid FHIR resources. In the 'CDS-Validator' implementation in the Github,it is checking whether the datatype is String though. Can you provide feedback about this? Many thanks..</p>",
