In other words, a hospital that experiences CDS Hooks as just another (helpful, slick, modern) built-in features within their EHR will be the quickest to adopt. There's always a chicken and egg problem here, but in some cases we're seeing EHRs adopt CDS Hooks not as a replacement (or even a complement) to existing vendor-specific CDS APIS, but as their <em>first</em> externally-accessible CDS API.</p>",
