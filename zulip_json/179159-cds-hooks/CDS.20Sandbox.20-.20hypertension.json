Looks like the Sandbox has a default configured for the <code>patient-hello-world</code> and <code>cms-price-check</code> services only, and the <code>pediatric-dose-check</code> service, which is what I believe you're referring to, was not included. I think there's some work still needing to be done to uplift that <code>pediatric-dose-check</code> service to 1) conform to the latest spec changes and 2) fix the decision workflow (an existing issue). But technically, if you re-add the discovery endpoint for the new default CDS services, it should populate as expected. However, I'd wait till the fixes to that service are in place. I'll log an issue for this.</p>",
