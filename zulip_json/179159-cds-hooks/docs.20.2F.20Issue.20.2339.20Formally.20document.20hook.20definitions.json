Strengthen our documentation around our currently predefined hooks. The key data here is the value of the <code>context</code> in the CDS Service request.<br>\n2. Clearly document expectations for how future hooks should be defined.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Although the spec currently only defines three; there are many potentially standardizeable hooks. As part of the standardization of each of these events, we should identify the data that describes the event and define which FHIR resources best fit.</p>\n<p>The medication-prescribe hook occurs when the user is in the process of prescribing a new medication<br>\n1. What's the purpose of the EHR calling the hook?<br>\n - Identify the workflow in which the event occurs.<br>\n - Identify the intent of the EHR for calling the hook. E.g. The EHR solicits feedback about the prescription-in-progress.<br>\n2. Clearly and authoritatively identify the FHIR resources that are included in the context attribute from the EHR to the CDS service.</p>\n<p>The content in <a href=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Proposed-Hooks\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Proposed-Hooks\">Proposed Hooks</a> is a good start, except that each proposed hook should identify its required context.</p>\n</blockquote>",
