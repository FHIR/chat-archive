In the cdshooks specification it talks about CDS providers or external CDS providers.  It seems I would want my CDS Service to live in one of those but there arent any except for the cdshooks sandbox - or are ehr vendors also providing the server side for cds service discovery?  reference to spec: <br>\n\"Call discovery endpointÂ¶<br>\nThe CDS discovery endpoint provides the list of services a CDS provider supports, and the hooks a service should be invoked on. A CDS Client may configure their system to support a set of hooks at a certain location in their users work flow, or build a dynamic capability to interact with a CDS Service provider within a work flow. For the best end-user experience, this guide recommends a business analyst configure which hooks a CDS Client will support.\"</p>",
