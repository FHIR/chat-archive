I know there is specific instructions on batch create operations using FHIR Bundles, I'm wondering if there has been any discussion about this in CDS-Hooks. The references to the existing resources would probably take the same Resource/123, should the new references do this too, just with a temporary ID assigned by the CDS-service?</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>",
