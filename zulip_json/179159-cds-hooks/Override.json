In addition, there is a proposal for <a href=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Acknowledgement-reasons-for-1.1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/wiki/Acknowledgement-reasons-for-1.1\">acknowledgement reasons</a> that we've been looking at. How the actual override gets persisted in the CDS Client and/or Service is something that would be up to the implementations, but it would be great to get some ideas about how to represent those. Can you provide a little more detail about your use case for an \"order check override\"?</p>",
