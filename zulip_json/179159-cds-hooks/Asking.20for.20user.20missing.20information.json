If I can't though, I'd like to be able to ask the user for it. This could involve asking for a number, string, date, or a list of choices. Asking the user for more information doesn't really seem to be handled by CDS hooks right now all that well, so I was thinking of abusing links for the list of choices - but then how would I get input on a number/string/date?</p>",
