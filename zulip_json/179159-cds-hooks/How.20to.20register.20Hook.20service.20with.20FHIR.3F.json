Therefore, I am unsure what you're confused about.</p>\n<p>Will server1 always use server2 for processing hook requests? If so, then just hardcode your cds hooks service endpoint. If it is dynamically set with a request, then make the cds hooks service endpoint a parameter. Like <code>fhir.ourserver.org/$some-operation?patient=Patient/example&amp;cdsEndpoint=otherserver.org/cds-services</code>.</p>\n<p>Does that help?</p>",

Today, EHRs are the predominant entity/actor that are registering CDS Services. This is being done based upon each individual EHR's implementation and organizational practices/processes. Put another way, how a CDS Service is registered with someone is not standard (it is not something that really can be standardized).</p>\n<p>As <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191897\">@Christopher Schuler</span> noted, the Discovery API in CDS Hooks facilitates this registration.</p>",
