I'd say leaving this to an offline process feels right to me.</p>\n<p>In practice (as a CDS-service), we would probably put some logic into our Discovery endpoint that can quickly enable/disable services for different clients. Then during our discussions with the client team about getting our CDS-service online we'd naturally be having a conversation about what FHIR resources they support - if the minimum requirements weren't met, we'd go in and disable the service for that client until a future time. That doesn't feel unduly arduous to me.</p>\n<p>Maybe this can be revisited further down the line if it's causing big headaches, but in the interest of not making the standard more confusing or challenging to implement I'd vote for staying with a manual/offline process.</p>\n</blockquote>",
