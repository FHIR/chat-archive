Doesn't feel like there is a strong need to add anything to the standard to cover this.</p>\n<p>In regards to EHR responsibility for possibly tracking errors/timeouts SLA levels. I think it's okay to trust that the client and the CDS vendor can manage this as per their existing contractual obligations without needing to address it in the standard.</p>\n<p>During scheduled downtime, I don't think the standard needs to define how the EHRs handle a resulting 503. Perhaps some suggestions or a best practice guide would be okay, but it's up to the EHR's discretion on what gracefully handling a 503 looks like. The CDS vendor should be communicating with the client well ahead of time to minimize the impact of any major workflow disruptions anyways.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If you get back a 500 without any additional info the only recourse to try to figure out what's wrong is to ask the server owners to check their logs. If there are some details about what's going wrong maybe it is possible to fix it directly, or at least not having to start the troubleshooting from square zero.</p>\n</blockquote>",

To that, I don't see the EHR parsing the 500 error response and doing anything with it.</p>\n<p>So, why define/constrain the CDS Service to return any particular data in the body of a 500 response?</p>\n</blockquote>",
