Currently, this is either not possible or requires proprietary EMR configuration. </p>\n<p>From a CDS service perspective, we prefer not to have to use EMR specific configuration. Instead, we'd like a standard mechanism where, as part of the hook itself, we can specify when we want to be called.</p>\n<p>As far as the mechanism itself, the options range from a CQL based specification to a simple list of relevant resources (ex. Imaging Appropriateness service can specify list of imaging orders as part of <code>order-sign</code> hook). My personal preference is to keep it as simple as possible, in order to encourage EMRs to support it. So, I'd be happy with just a list of orders associated with a hook.</p>",
