We've seen multiple examples using the FHIR<br>\nHAPI server with synthetic patients and CDS Sandbox, but we were hoping to<br>\nsee something in production at a health system.  Our operations folks are<br>\nhoping to see how a health system's knowledge management division/team<br>\nauthored a CDS tool and then served as data stewards to coordinate with<br>\nenterprise analytics and devops/data engineers for a real production item<br>\nthat met their quality care needs. Any help or offer from a health system<br>\nis much appreciated.  Thank you</p>",

To be clear, these are feasibility pilots, not production implementations. I will reach out to the pilot sites and let them know that you may be interested in engaging with them. There is a fifth site that utilizes a SMART app to launch an interface with a CDS service, and this approach is in production. I can reach out to them as well. I ask for your patience as I am at HIMSS this week. However, be assured that I will follow back up with you once I have a response from the sites.</p>",
