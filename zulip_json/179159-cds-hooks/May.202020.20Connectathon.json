Sign up on our <a href=\"https://bit.ly/cds-hooks-connectathon-tracking\" title=\"https://bit.ly/cds-hooks-connectathon-tracking\">Google Spreadsheet</a> if you plan to participate, indicating who you are, what <strong>time zone</strong> you're in, and information about your CDS Client/Server + what you're wanting to test.  Coordination across time zones will bring a new dynamic to the event, and having yourself in this spreadsheet will help immensely.</p>\n<p>Reach out if you have questions, or feel free to start chiming in here if you want to start setting up your integrations!</p>",
