        "content": "<p>The CRD specification has references to a number of hooks, but none of the ones we need are actually published as a 'stable' balloted specification.  Our challenge is that when we formally publish the CRD spec, we need to have a permalink that refers to the hook definition (and ideally that points to a 'frozen' view of the hook definitions).  With the HL7 core spec, we create frozen snapshots for connectathons and ballots every 4-5 months and - occasionally - we create special ones for a particular publication.  However, there doesn't seem to be an equivalent process for the CRD spec.  We really need something like this.  We can't reasonably hold off CRD until every hook we care about passes STU and we can't publish a spec where the links either break or the names of parameters, cardinalities or even types of what's linked to differ from what the specification assumes.</p>\n<p>So: can we institute a process where the draft CDS Hooks spec (including hook definitions) can be occasionally snapshotted and those snapshots made available at a permalink site?  E.g. <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/cds-hooks/2020-May\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/cds-hooks/2020-May\">http://hl7.org/fhir/cds-hooks/2020-May</a> or something like that?<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191864\">@Isaac Vetter</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191315\">@Josh Mandel</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191316\">@Grahame Grieve</span></p>",
