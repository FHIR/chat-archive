Im not too worried about this  right now, but you should keep this open for improvement in the future. Second, how do you assure that the CDS gets only the data that the user would have access too? For example a scenario where a Patient consent has blocked some data from a provider; where a decision using that data would have exposed the data; for example where the provider is knolwdgable that a specific decision could only have been made by CDS if X data was available.</p>",
