If Markdown is optional, it would be nice for EHRs to advertise their support for it so that CDS Services can return cards accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>Markdown Flavor</strong><br>\nWhat flavor of Markdown should CDS Hooks support? Eg, <a href=\"http://commonmark.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://commonmark.org/\">CommonMark</a>? <a href=\"https://github.github.com/gfm/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.github.com/gfm/\">Github Flavored Markdown</a>? etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks with Embedded HTML in Markdown</strong><br>\nMarkdown allows for any embedded HTML. Should this be allowed? If so, we need to document how EHRs must mitigate against risks of cards that now contain executable code (JS) or conflicts with CSS classes/names.</p>\n<p>Risks with embedded HTML is actually no different than risks posed by embedding SMART apps in an EHR. However, we should probably call out good practices (like usage of iframes).</p>\n<p>A potential difference between integrating SMART apps and CDS cards into the EHR is the level of integration we expect with CDS cards. The intention is that since the majority of a CDS card is structured data rather than UX (or entirely if there is no embedded HTML), then the rendering of the card should be close or indistinguishable from the native EHR.</p>\n<p>Another point of consideration is that allowing for embedded HTML in the Markdown starts to veer CDS cards in the direction of mini SMART apps.</p>\n<p>And finally, another option could be allowing for embedded HTML but only a subset of HTML functionality/tags (a whitelist). This would offer CDS cards the ability to style themselves somewhat but perhaps disallow them from incorporating app-like functionality.</p>\n<p>Thoughts &amp; discussions from the community is welcome!</p>\n</blockquote>",

We need to be quite careful about embedded HTML, but I think we need a way to reference at last images (possibly with a restriction to only allow inline base64 data-url images, if we want to avoid calls out to an external server) and tables (I know Markdown enables tables without HTML, but it's kind of a pain IMO). </p>\n<p>There's some relevant discussion at:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/narrative.html#2.4.0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/narrative.html#2.4.0\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/narrative.html#2.4.0</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/security.html#narrative\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/security.html#narrative\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/security.html#narrative</a></p>\n</blockquote>",

The EHR in most cases would do actual formatting and styling (after all you cannot assume this is displayed in a browser - and it is highly likely that there are space constraints), while what they need is the structure of the text and links. The alternative of plain text doesn't work well in practice. For real cards provided via hooks today, I have primary statements, secondary statements (long), and supporting evidence (citations with links), and a few other items. All of this is pushed into the detail as there is no better place for it.  An alternative might be to move it all to the smart app, but that would mean suggestions are of little use in a real CDS application. </p>\n</blockquote>",
