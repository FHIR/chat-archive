Can you all take a look at let me know if it looks good?</p>\n<p>@robcz - Thanks for pointing out the discrepancy on the source type (string vs object) documentation typo. You mentioned that <code>name</code> was referenced in the source examples instead of <code>label</code>. I think I fixed all of those in 927d5a8. Can you let me know if I missed any?</p>\n</blockquote>",
