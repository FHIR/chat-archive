This is the first I've heard of this use case (everyone else has just been defining prefetch templates that are correlated to the current patient). With that being said, I don't see this going against the CDS Hooks spec.</p>",

Eg, the EHR already has the requested data in memory or multiple CDS Services want the same data so the EHR can just grab it once and give it to each of the CDS Services requesting it</p>",
