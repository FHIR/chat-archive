This would be the first hook to fire when a clinician browses an order catalogue, allowing a decision service to make recommendations.

The order-select hook is able to avoid this because the selected order that is passed has a specific type, meaning decision services that apply to MedicationRequest selections need not fire if a bundle contains ServiceRequests. The proposal suggests adding an orderType parameter to provide that same functionality.</p>",

For a specific decision support service implementation I'd expect it to query (or prefetch) whatever additional data it might need. It could definitely be argued that the ability to do that makes the orderType parameter redundant. I think it remains relevant because it allows a first-pass filter on the types of services that run. The type of data included in the order-select hook allows similar functionality.</p>\n<p>I did consider using something like useContext to provide this functionality. That would allow much more granularity in the filter. However, the initial feedback I had was that that would be very difficult to implement on the EHR side.</p>\n<p>I also considered creating hooks specifically for device-search, medication-search, etc. but that seemed to run counter to current efforts to represent orders generally.</p>\n<p>Trying to cover the breadth of possibilities for orders and clinical contexts when browsing a catalog is pretty challenging. I'd welcome other suggestions. The \"all-in\" approach of extensively using useContext (or similar) to scope the services seems onerous for EHR implementors, while the \"run all the services\" approach seems extremely inefficient when many \"order\" hooks have no chance of being relevant.</p>",

Having more of the pre-conditions known and conveyed up front for the order (medication and specific serviceRequest) can help (maybe) reduce these iterations?</p>",

The initial feedback I had was that it would prove to be difficult from an EHR implementation perspective since they'd have to provide appropriate context when invoking the hook. That may not actually be the case, but that's the feedback I'm working from. If there's a better way to specify and track that context from an EHR's perspective I'd like to know and incorporate that into the hook definition.</p>\n<p>Let's consider an alternate proposal for a \"medication-search\" hook that has a useContext parameter. That would provide sufficient granularity to only invoke the hook specifically for the \"medication prescription for diabetes\" scenario. The \"medication-search\" aspect runs counter to the consolidation of the order-* hooks (medication-prescribe is being retired), and the additional useContext has the same supposed difficulties for EHR implementation.</p>",

And at that point, you're good to go with your first firing of the \"order-select\" hook.  If dealing with ServiceRequest, the EHR might be able to tell whether the clinician is about to order a lab vs. imaging vs. make a referral, but I doubt they'd know more than that until, again, the user had started to fill out the form (and order-select would be viable).  My question was for a concrete example of a couple of useful cards you would expect a service to provide back with the current design for the hook.  It may be there would be useful things you could say that would need to be said before you'd started filling out the order form/selecting from a care plan/bunch of order sets.
