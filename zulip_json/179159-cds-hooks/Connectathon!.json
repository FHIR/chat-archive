We could resend the information to the source later (similar to how we're treating failed hooks), make an API call for the source to just get actions taken as they want, or use scheduled reports.  Since most of our stuff is around the ordering workflow, I think for us this is  largely about making sure we're taking the right level of action and providing an audit not just giving the source feedback.</p>",
