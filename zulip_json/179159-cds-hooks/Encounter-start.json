It was initiated as part of the Da Vinci Coverage Requirements Discovery (CRD) project, but is intended to be generally applicable. It allows decision support services to provide recommendations at the start of an encounter (e.g. when patient is admitted, when patient arrives at the clinic,  when practitioner first sees the patient during a visit).  The objective is to provide a filtered hook that is more granular than patient-view such that hooks related to evaluating what actions should happen during the encounter can provide that guidance during the time such decisions are being made, but not pop up continuously on the screen each time a clinician or other individual looks at the patient's record (which in some cases can occur outside the scope of an encounter entirely).</p>",
