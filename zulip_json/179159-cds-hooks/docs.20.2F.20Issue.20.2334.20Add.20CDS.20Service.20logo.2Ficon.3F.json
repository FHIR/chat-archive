This is fraught with UX issues as the CDS Service developer doesn't know how big to make the image since how it is rendered varies by EHR.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we should add first-class support for a logo/icon either in the card itself (via a first-class attribute) or in the CDS service definition in the Discovery endpoint.</p>\n<p>We should be prescriptive on the size and format of the logo/icon. Additionally, we should be clear if this is a logo or an icon (there is a difference from a UX perspective).</p>\n<p>I'd like to explore first if we can put this in the Discovery endpoint for each service rather than an attribute on the card.</p>\n</blockquote>",
