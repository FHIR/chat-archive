I've read most of the github discussions, including here: <a href=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/26\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/26\">https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/pull/26</a></p>\n<p>Is the spec's intention to return complete resources, or just an array of ID strings to resources hosted by the CDS service? I'm Trying to make an example response for an EMR hoping to implement CDS-Hooks, I know this isn't solidified yet, I'm just wondering if theres been any further discussion on it that I may have missed.</p>",
