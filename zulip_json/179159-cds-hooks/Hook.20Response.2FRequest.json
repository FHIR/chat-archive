There's a separation of concerns, such that the CDS Hooks request is <strong>not</strong> \"re-played\" when a SMART app is launched from your CDS Hooks <code>card</code>. Rather, the SMART app launch follows the <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/#smart-launch-sequence\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/#smart-launch-sequence\">standard SMART launch sequence</a> and does not receive the CDS Hooks request, including context and pre-fetch.</p>",
