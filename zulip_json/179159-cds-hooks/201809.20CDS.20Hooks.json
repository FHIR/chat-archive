Thank you. </p>\n<p>\"===Implement Potential Drug-Drug Interaction check using 1.0 spec===<br>\n:'''Action''': With the medication-prescribe hook, the EHR sends a request that may include prefetch data to the CDS Service. The CDS Service may request additional data from the FHIR server then returns an array of Card(s) with associated suggestions. <br>\n:'''Precondition''': A prefetch or FHIR server query for contextual data element (below) resources (e.g., MedicationDispense, MedicationAdministration, MedicationRequest, MedicationStatement, Patient, Observation, Condition). Preference for obtaining medication resources with prefetch query. <br>\n:'''Success Criteria''': The EHR displays the appropriate Card response for the specified indicator element.<br>\n:'''Bonus point''': The EHR supports Card actions (i.e., create, update, delete) relevant to drug-drug interactions that may include canceling the current drug order, substituting the current drug order, discontinuing a historical drug, and adding an additional non-drug order (e.g., lab). The EHR supports parsing the DetectedIssue resource as an extension to the CDS Hooks Card Attributes. The EHR supports medication-select â€“ defined as the step when the provider selects the drug product (i.e., ingredient and strength) during order entry. <br>\n''Specific data elements for Connectathon use case include: Current medications, Historical medications, Age, Serum digoxin, Serum creatinine, Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium, and History of Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed.''\"</p>",
