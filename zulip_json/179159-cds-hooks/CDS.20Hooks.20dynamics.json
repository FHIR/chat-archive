Order-select CDS services are recalled when the order changes. The new cards will replace the existing ones.<br>\n(2) CDS services are ordered in a list. The first server is called and the cards are shown. When the user closes this card, the next CDS Server will be called <br>\n(3) All CDS Services are updated when the context changes. </p>\n<p>Card behavior<br>\n(1) All cards remain in place, additional CDS calls will add new cards to the list.<br>\n(2) Cards are only removed when this is explicitly done by the end-user<br>\n(3) Cards are removed when a suggestion is followed.</p>\n<p>The specification does not state what the expected behavior is. What is the expected behavior?</p>",
