One of the requirements is to provide the proof/justification that the elements satisfying the rule that triggered the alert have to be conveyed back in the CDS Hooks response. To do this we intend using a 'contained' resource which shall act as a bucket to showcase the resources that triggered the alert. e.g. If the patient is suffering from Diabetes for the past 10 years and and is above 50 yrs then trigger an alert for something. So while conveying the alert in CDS Hooks I want to show case the resources that triggered this alert which might be 'Condition containing Diabetes code and Condition-onset date along with Patient resource containing the age of the patient. We intend using the 'Contained' resource in the 'Plan Definition' so that CQL when executed brings back a list of resources against a given expression as an output which can be placed in the 'contained' resource. In order to do this, I am assuming we'll have to add it as an extension on the Plan Definition. Is that the correct approach to be taken, or there's a better way to do that.</p>",
