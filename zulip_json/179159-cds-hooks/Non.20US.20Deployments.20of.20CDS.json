The architecture is described here, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037018303507\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037018303507</a>.</p>\n<p>We have deployments of cds-hooks based CDS-services in Sweden and New Zealand. Some of our cds-service development as part of 2018 Scotland National CDS Programme is also based on CDS-hooks.
