We weren't discussing the decision workflow. I mention this because I did not see the <code>redirect</code> field being used just anytime a user follows a link in a card and wants to come back to the EHR.

I'm guessing in nearly every <code>absolute</code> link case, we cannot follow the redirect (since those likely aren't apps). Additionally, my assumption here is that EHRs aren't going to want to change navigation to a link in a card. Rather, I'm assuming that EHRs will likely want to open the link in a new window or component/tab within the EHR itself.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"jmandel@gmail.com\" data-user-id=\"9\">@Josh Mandel</span> - Did you think we were using <code>redirect</code> when a user is done visiting any link on a card or did some wires get crossed here?</p>\n</blockquote>",

That's part of handling a \"return\" operation. Of course, we could add on a parameter (<code>&amp;refetch=yes-please</code>, or whatever) to save the extra work.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm assuming that EHRs will likely want to open the link in a new window or component/tab within the EHR itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, this is up to the EHR to decide. But in the event that the EHR opens a new window and doesn't receive \"return\", the EHR is basically saying \"You don't get to make decisions\". That's okay...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"jmandel@gmail.com\" data-user-id=\"9\">@Josh Mandel</span> - Did you think we were using redirect when a user is done visiting any link on a card or did some wires get crossed here?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think <code>redriect</code> <em>can apply</em> any time a user clicks a link on a card. Now, there could always be _additional_ (out of band, from the CDS Hooks perspective) ways to \"finish with an app\" (e.g. the EHR might also display a big \"X\" next to the app view, or might just open it in a new window that's totally disconnected from the user session). But as an in-band way of \"returning\", the <code>redirect</code> works equally well for SMART apps and other linkable services.</p>\n</blockquote>",
