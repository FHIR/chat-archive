        "content": "<p>Hi everyone! I have some updates on the Sandbox that I wanted to bring everyone's attention to. This also important for those attending the Connectathon this weekend in Cologne!</p>\n<p>First, the Sandbox that has served us well over the past three years has been retired and is now available at <a href=\"http://legacy-sandbox.cds-hooks.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://legacy-sandbox.cds-hooks.org\">http://legacy-sandbox.cds-hooks.org</a>. We will keep this Sandbox around indefinitely, both the deployment and the source code which now is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/legacy-sandbox\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/legacy-sandbox\">https://github.com/cds-hooks/legacy-sandbox</a></p>\n<p>Next, we have a new Sandbox that has been written for the ground up for CDS Hooks 1.0! This new Sandbox  retains the same look &amp; feel from the legacy Sandbox as well as supporting the CDS Hooks 1.0 specification. This Sandbox is what is deployed when you go to <a href=\"http://sandbox.cds-hooks.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://sandbox.cds-hooks.org\">http://sandbox.cds-hooks.org</a> (note that HTTP also works!). The source code for our Sandbox is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/sandbox\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cds-hooks/sandbox\">https://github.com/cds-hooks/sandbox</a></p>\n<p>Why the change?</p>\n<p>The legacy Sandbox was originally written as a demo prototype by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191315\">@Josh Mandel</span> to illustrate the the idea of CDS Hooks. We got a ton of mileage out of this original codebase (thank you Josh!) but as we approached our 1.0 release, we realized that we needed to formalize and harden the codebase. The new Sandbox is built using the same technology (React JS app) but using the latest version and a design for (internal) testability in mind. That means our new Sandbox has a complete test suite so we have a lot more confidence in our changes. And finally, we split out the default CDS Services out into their own project to keep a nice separation of concerns between the Sandbox and those default CDS Service.</p>\n<p>I want to thank <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192599\">@Zach Plata</span> who has been working tirelessly on enhancements to the legacy Sandbox over the past year as well as writing our new Sandbox from the ground up!</p>",
