In general, profiles should avoid limiting the upper cardinality for elements as it essentially says \"if you have data that I don't need, you have to spend money to remove data that I could ignore for free\" - which isn't the ideal statement to make if you are genuinely interested in interoperability.  (If you only want one element and an element could potentially repeat, best practice is to instead enforce a limitation such as \"one instance must have this special use code or extension\" rather than saying \"there can only be one instance\" - that way a system can emit a single instance that can consume both your \"single element\" requirement as well as the needs of other consumers who may need multiple or different occurrences of the same element.</p>",
