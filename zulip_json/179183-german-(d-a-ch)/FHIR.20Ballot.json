If, by midnight Eastern tonight we don't have at least a 50% response, the ballots will fail. We do have the ability to do a one-time extension to allow additional submissions to come in, but doing so will make it difficult to triage the comments for consideration in Baltimore which in turn puts other aspects of the publication timeline at risk. (And if we don't make 50% by the end of any extension period, we fail with no further recourse.)</p>\n<p>TL/DR: Get your ballot responses in ASAP!</p>\n</blockquote>",
