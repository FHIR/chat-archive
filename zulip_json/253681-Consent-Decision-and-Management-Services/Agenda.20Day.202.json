Guessing that none of the the sample resources have more than one security label.  Typical security label would have one confidentiality code, 1..* sensitivity code, 1 policy code, e.g., 42 CFR Part 2, and 1..* purpose of use.  Some will also have 1..* obligation or refrain codes.  Mohammad and I are working on the FHIR DS4P IG to help implementers figure this out.  It gets complex when there are more than one policy being conveyed by the label.  But not atypical - in US, information governed under 42 CFR Part 2 and HIPAA can be in one resource or bundle.</p>",

Everything seems to be dropped, like a grab bag of stuff, in 'securityLabel'. But the cdsHooks response seems to split it out - some how ...<br>\nI have assumed any with a 'v3-Confidentiality' is an \"id\" - each in it's own \"id\" and everything with a 'v3-ActCode' is a 'parameter'.<br>\nSo, if there's two 'v3-Confidentiality' and four 'v3-ActCode' in a securityLabel, then that's two 'id's, each with four 'parameters'.  And then you have to keep the logical OR of all of that across all actors, across all Consent resources, across all FHIR servers ...</p>",

With out 'class' it's just an ambit claim for access, with the hope that if the patient has ever lodge a Consent, then the caller can get back knowledge that there is a Consent out there somewhere, and what the 'secuityLabel's are ... My Consent Decision Service rejects ambit/fishing exercises, but I haven't found any guidance as to whether that is correct, or incorrect.</p>",
