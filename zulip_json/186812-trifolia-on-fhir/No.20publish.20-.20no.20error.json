Hi Folks,<br>\nAngst. Need IG to publish for connectathon...<br>\nMy IG is not publishing today. Last successful publish was Friday afternoon.<br>\nI'd hoped it would fix itself over the weekend.<br>\nThough TBH, it may have been a different error Friday. It was after I had done some markdown reformatting on one of my narrative pages (again no error)<br>\nNow it is just stopping here (see below) without an error report:<br>\nFetching:<br>\nInstalling:<br>\ndone.<br>\nChecking Output HTML                                                             (04:47.0643)<br>\nfound 2125 files                                                                 (04:47.0670)</p>",
