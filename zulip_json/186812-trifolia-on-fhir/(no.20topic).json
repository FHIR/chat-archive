I have modeled the settings in PDex for a resource after the CDexTask resource in the CDEX IG. When I try to publish I get an exit code of 1. This is probably because of the following warnings:<br>\nwarning ImplementationGuide/davinci-pdex    A resource should have narrative for robust management [text.div.exists()]<br>\nwarning ImplementationGuide/davinci-pdex    A resource should have narrative for robust management [text.div.exists()]<br>\nwarning StructureDefinition/pdex-medicationdispense A resource should have narrative for robust management [text.div.exists()]<br>\nwarning StructureDefinition/pdex-medicationdispense A resource should have narrative for robust management [text.div.exists()]</p>\n<p>How do I fix these warnings? Do I need to copy a StructureDefinition into place or is that handled by Trifolia.</p>",
