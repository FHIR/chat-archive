Last week, we updated the production installation with the latest changes from the DEV environment. Please resume using the production environment as your primary environment, as we want to resume using DEV as a dev-only environment. Sometime near the end of next week we will be updating DEV with some <em>potentially</em> breaking changes. Please ensure that you are using the production (stable) environment by then.</p>",
