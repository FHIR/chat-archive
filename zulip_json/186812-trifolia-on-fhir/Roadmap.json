Looking at the \"Resource UI Support\" in the README (<a href=\"https://github.com/lantanagroup/trifolia-on-fhir/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lantanagroup/trifolia-on-fhir/blob/master/README.md\">https://github.com/lantanagroup/trifolia-on-fhir/blob/master/README.md</a>), most resources are shown to only be \"DSTU3\". Is this table out-of-date? In not, what are the roadmap plans for updating these resources to FHIR R4? Is any of this related to Lantana's fork of HAPI FHIR meaning are there R4-related dependencies on Lantana's fork of HAPI FHIR?</p>",
