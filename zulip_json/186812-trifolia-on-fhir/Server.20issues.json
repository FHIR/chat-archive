I renamed the ID of the R4 Coverage profile from \"carin-bb-Coverage\" to \"CARIN-BB-Coverage\" to conform to an existing ID pattern. I made sure that the profile wasn't referenced by the carin-bb IG and it seems the rename completed without any error. However now I can't seem to find that profile using the new or the old ID. Also, when I try to recreate the profile (same new ID) using Import, I get a server error. Any idea what may be going on? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"243554\">@Pat Taylor</span></p>",
