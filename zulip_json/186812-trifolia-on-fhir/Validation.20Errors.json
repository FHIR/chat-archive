In the qa.html file, I see that for many errors, there is a reference to org.hl7.fhir.r5.model. I'm wondering if the validator is using R5 rather than R4 models, which might be the reason for many errors. Maybe the new version of the validator runs R5 by default and there is a need to supply a parameter to use R4?</p>",

Before I ask at the IG Creation stream, I just wanted to confirm if Tirfolia uses IG Publisher with the correct FHIR version (R4 in this case). Because of the \"org.hl7.fhir.r5.model.Coding\" errors, I suspect that a version  parameter might be missing. For example, if in the past, R4 used to be IG Publisher's default, but in the recent version the default has changed to R5, Trifolia might need to supply R4 as a version parameter when running IG Publisher. Again, this is just my speculation, but I thought it would be worthwhile to check with you before raising my questions on another stream.</p>",
