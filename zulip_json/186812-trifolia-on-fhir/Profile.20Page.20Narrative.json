As a work around, I had tried to add narrative to the \"StructureDefinition.description\" element - this looked fine, though it appears at the top of the Profile page, but then the overall Profile &amp; Extensions page looked ugly with very long descriptions of the profiles.</p>",

Another option would be to create a page <em>on</em> the implementation guide that has your additional details, and then link to it from the description of the template. For example: \"Read this {page} for more information.\"</p>",
