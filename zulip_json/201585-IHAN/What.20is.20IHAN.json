We store health and wellness data into various accounts, and should be able to transfer it between those accounts, hence the need for an International Health Account Number. Then things momentarily got a bit out of hand, and the scope was expanded to cover more than just health and wellness data (International Human Account Number), and also the operational model (International Human Account Network). It all became a bit too much, so now it’s called IHAN - Human-Driven Data Economy.</p>",
