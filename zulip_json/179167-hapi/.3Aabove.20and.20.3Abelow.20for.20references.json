When I tried in 3.7.0, there were no errors on the search, but it didn't return the additional results.  I tried it on <a href=\"http://hapi.fhir.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hapi.fhir.org\">hapi.fhir.org</a> as well with no luck.  I didn't find any configuration options for it, but I certainly could have missed it.  Thanks!</p>",
