This is a result of two things: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The HAPI server died over the holidays, and getting it back on its feet has turned out to be more of a challenge than I expected.</li>\n<li>For some reason I've had a deluge of HAPI related emails, zulips, skypes, pull requests, and bug reports over the last 2 weeks, and many of the HAPI related things have been on topics that require a fair bit of investigation just to get through one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you've sent me something and I haven't responded yet, please don't take it personally. :( The public HAPI server is now fully back on its feet (websockets were the last thing to get working again and that just happened last night) so I'm slowly chipping away at the backlog now.</p>",
