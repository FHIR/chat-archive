I thought it is used as the canonical URL of the ValueSet, the one to which bindings point, for example, but it seems that the server looks at the binded url as an actual resource address.<br>\nIn profiles on the other hand, the server finds the local StructureDefinition resource by it's url attribute, even if the this url leads to nowhere.<br>\nWhat is behind this defference in bahaviour, and what the value set's url attribute is used for?</p>",
