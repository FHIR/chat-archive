But I don't know why that is. Seems to be working well enough for our purposes so far. Davera suggested that I could discover more about why that is the case by asking here on Zulip.</p>",

The point that I made to  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"340004\">@Davera Gabriel</span>  is that 'vanilla' HAPI is an all-purpose FHIR Server and, as such, requires a certain degree of additional customization to be used as a dedicated FHIR Terminology Server.  Several of the existing FHIR Terminology Server developers (e.g. OntoServer) have taken this approach.</p>\n<p>It might be informative to look at the  Vocabulary WG’s proposal for a set of minimum FHIR Terminology Server capabilities. The relevant Jira CR Ticket can be found <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-24698\">here</a>.  My understanding (and please correct me if I'm wrong) is that HAPI does not support all of these capabilities 'out of the box'.</p>",
