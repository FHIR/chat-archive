As per FHIR spec, it should return a batch-response type bundle, having first entry as operational outcome and 2nd entry as 201 created. To surprise, it is returning operational outcome as a single response. Request and response attached. Any insights would be appreciated.</p>\n<p>I'm sending an invalid Patient.gender. As per spec, it should fail at Patient resource validation level rather than Bundle level.<br>\nRequest and response attached.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/yL-9Q3eKtyT4WeVTNab2uTUy/request.json\">request.json</a> <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/NtBHp_Qth7DYxsQrIyydVjc3/response.json\">response.json</a></p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",

The hapi server should return the result in a batch-response Bundle. Having the OperationOutcome inside the response backBone element</p>",
