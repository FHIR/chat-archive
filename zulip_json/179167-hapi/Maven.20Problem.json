        "content": "<p>Hi Grahame,</p>\n<p>Looks like the master branch has already revisioned to 5.6.22-SNAPSHOT while the  gg-202201-r4b branch has not. The build is running on the post-merge version of the branch so all the other maven modules are at 5.6.22-SNAPSHOT. R4B is not because it's new and wasn't updated on master, so it's looking for a non-existent (from the perspective of the post-merge branch) 5.6.21-SNAPSHOT parent pom. If you merge in the changes from master (or rebase onto master) and then update the rb4 version to 5.6.22-SNAPSHOT it should work. I debugged this by checking to see which branch was actually being built by the CI in the logs here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dev.azure.com/fhir-pipelines/fhir-core-library/_build/results?buildId=5363&amp;view=logs&amp;j=011e1ec8-6569-5e69-4f06-baf193d1351e&amp;t=28cbacfb-5312-5cce-4e9c-30e7286e4c6d&amp;l=648\">https://dev.azure.com/fhir-pipelines/fhir-core-library/_build/results?buildId=5363&amp;view=logs&amp;j=011e1ec8-6569-5e69-4f06-baf193d1351e&amp;t=28cbacfb-5312-5cce-4e9c-30e7286e4c6d&amp;l=648</a></p>",
