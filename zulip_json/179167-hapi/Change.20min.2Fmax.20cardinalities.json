Any profiling should stay within the limits of the base definition. e.g. 0..1 can only be changed to 1..1 or 0..0 while 0..* can be set to 1..*, 1..2, 0..1, and so forth, 1..1 can not be changed into anything else. The reason to this is that all FHIR messages (either with a profile or not) should still conform to the FHIR specification. If you would have more than one text element in any resource this would not validate against the base specification.</p>",
