In a <a href=\"http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-epr-term/ValueSet-DocumentEntry.confidentialityCode.html\">ValueSet</a> I have a compose with 2 snomed ct codes inside. SNOMED CT is not directly supported so the expanded ValueSets are not containing these 2 codes (the IG Publisher can handle this with the terminology server). An option would be to upload the snomed ct codesystem directly, however I would like to have a quicker development solution:<br>\nIs it possible to connect <a href=\"http://tx.fhir.org\">tx.fhir.org</a> to hapi for testing purpose? And if yes has somebody a sample how to add that to JpaValidationSupportChain?</p>",

I found out that you can defer the ValueSet Expansion by not setting setDeferIndexingForCodesystemsOfSize. Then the InMemoryTerminologyServerValidationSupport expands the ValueSet and is not validating the codes and in addition it is possible to disable the task expanding the ValueSets. I have the example ig jpa validation server up <a href=\"https://github.com/ahdis/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter/tree/ig\">here</a> and can now validate with the $validate operation, time for the weekend <span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span></p>",
