For a generic client that connects to many servers, the complexity currently lies with the client. The various differences in support reminds me of the 'webbrowser specific code' that has/had to be developed. We may need a server-side profile which the community, the creators of clients, should demand the servers sign up to. According to the FHIR spec they don't have to do so, but they could volunteer  to sign up to it - it would give generic clients just more certainty that a certain set of functionality will be present.</p>",

It could do partial searches, fuzzy/phonetic searches, right and nickname searches even, but it needs to be set up with appropriate indexing.. and that indexing takes up lots of space if you want your searches to be very flexible.</p>\n<p>I've tried to come up with sensible defaults in HAPI for how Lucene indexes, but one thing that is annoying about Hibernate Search (which is how we currently use Lucene)- it is really hard to change the way it indexes without recompiling your code. So  it's hard for a hapi user to change it.</p>\n<p>Probably what we need to do is to switch over to using elasticsearch instead, which is much easier to configure without having to move the earth. This work is planned, although not yet scheduled.</p>",
