This server has been having lots of filesystem issues lately, so I think it's time to move off.</p>\n<p>So as of now, the server is deployed to AWS (instead of being hosted at UHN) and is now backed by a PostgreSQL 9.4 database instead of Apache Derby. I'm hoping this will go a long way towards improving performance on this server.</p>\n<p>This means that all 3 endpoints (DSTU1, DSTU2, STU3) are now empty once again. I'm in the process of uploading the example resources into each, but if you have tests that rely on your own resources being in there you'll need to re-upload that.</p>\n<p>I'm going to re-upload Snomed CT and LOINC definition files a bit later today.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nJames</p>",
