I assume I could do a hard write into the database, but wanted to check if this would mess with the search indexes or any other feature.</li>\n<li>If I want to allow a specific user to access data from multiple partitions (though not all), does the interceptor hook allow this?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

It is possible to move a resource manually by directly manipulating the various partition_id columns in the DB however. Nothing in the JPA design will break if you do this.</p>\n<p>2- Not currently, but this is on our very short term roadmap (ie probably weeks away).</p>",
