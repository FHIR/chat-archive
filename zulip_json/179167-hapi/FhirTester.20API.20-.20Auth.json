Are there in docs or examples for doing this? The method within ITestingUiClientFactory is just a method returning a generic client interface and I'm not sure exactly where I would add in auth for this to work.<br>\nIn order for simplicity I was just going to pass/copy any Authorization headers present from the browser when viewing the fhir tester server (using ModHeader extension to add the bearer token to headers of all requests from chrome)</p>",
