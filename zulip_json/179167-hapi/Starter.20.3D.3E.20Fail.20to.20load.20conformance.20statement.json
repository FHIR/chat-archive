I did not change anything. (We only need this server for demonstration, so there is no need for us to have the data on a persistent layer.) When I call the page in the browser, I get the normal overview, but with the following warning:<br>\n<code>Warning!\nFailed to load conformance statement, error was: ca.uhn.fhir.rest.client.exceptions.FhirClientConnectionException: Failed to parse response from server when performing GET to URL http://localhost:8080/fhir/metadata - javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target</code><br>\nDoes anyone know what I need to do to get rid of this warning? <br>\nThanks in advance for everyone coming up with a constructive idea.</p>",
