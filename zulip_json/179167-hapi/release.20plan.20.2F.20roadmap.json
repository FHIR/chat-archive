Because of the dependency we have on the FHIR specification itself, we haven't wanted to do much long term forecasting because changes to the specification have often required significant changes to the library and that has made it hard to predict where we'll need to focus our efforts.</p>\n<p>It does seem like the rate of change to the core parts of FHIR is slowing down, and that rate will probably come down even more one STU3 is final, so it'll probably be time to look at a more predictable release schedule in the coming year.</p>",

I will probably sync them again within the next few days since we're about to release HAPI 1.6.</p>",
