I've imported this TestScript resource for search parameter in my FHIR HAPI server. </p>\n<p>Basically one of the thing this TestScript resource validates is that it should test search using the parameter name <em>PatientSearchFamilyName</em> now, i understand that I cannot search using this parameter unless i create Search Parameter Resource and change the SD. So, currently I'm getting error when I try to search using  this <em>PatientSearchFamilyName</em></p>\n<p>But, my question is. I have multiple use-cases like this I wanted to know how to run these TestScript resources in my FHIR server?. I tried using Crucible but it seems like its running its predefined TestScripts on my FHIR server.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions or help is much appreciated here.</p>",
