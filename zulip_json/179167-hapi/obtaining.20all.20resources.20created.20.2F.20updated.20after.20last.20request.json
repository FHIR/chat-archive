Unable to handle this request, as it does not contain a resource type or operation name.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I know that something is wrong with my search, and I see, that normally you would specify what kind of resource you are interested in.<br>\nBut as I am interested in all resources, I am not sure what to do.</p>\n<p>Has anyone an advice for me? <br>\nThanks in advance! I really appreciate your help.</p>",
