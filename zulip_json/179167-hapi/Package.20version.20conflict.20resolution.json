That is, how to handle the case where distinct packages A &amp; B both have the same package C as a dependency, but use different versions of C so that there are, potentially, two different version of the same profiles from C available. As far as I can tell from <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Handling.20package-version.20conflicts\">this general thread about the theme from April</a>, there does not seem to be an agreed FHIR-wide strategy for handling this. But does HAPI have anything in this direction implemented in the package-loading modules (or is there HAPI-specific guidance on how to handle this)?</p>",
