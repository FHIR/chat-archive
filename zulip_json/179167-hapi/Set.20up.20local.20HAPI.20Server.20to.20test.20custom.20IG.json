We have implemented a FHIR IG to represent the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health Phenopacket (<a href=\"https://phenopacket-schema.readthedocs.io/en/v2/\">https://phenopacket-schema.readthedocs.io/en/v2/</a>). Here is the published IG (<a href=\"https://github.com/phenopackets/core-ig\">https://github.com/phenopackets/core-ig</a>). Now, I would like to start a local FHIR server, import the IG to this server, and validate some simulated instances of the Phenopacket against the server. I have found a few tutorials on how to do this with the FHIR Patient resource for example (<a href=\"https://nhsconnect.github.io/CareConnectAPI/build_patient_server.html\">https://nhsconnect.github.io/CareConnectAPI/build_patient_server.html</a>). However, I am struggling to figure out where to start to do this for our IG. Any suggestions/help would be most appreciated!</p>",
