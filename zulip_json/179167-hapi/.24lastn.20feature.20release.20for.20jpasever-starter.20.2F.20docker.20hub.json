However, on <a href=\"https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter\">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter</a> the latest release (5.2.0) was made on November 18, while the PR to support $lastn is was merged in december: <br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter/pull/187\">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter/pull/187</a></p>\n<p>So it looks like for the jpaserver-starter (which IIRC is the base for the docker hub release images?) the $lastn Operation is not yet released.</p>\n<p>Is my understanding correct? If so, are there plans to release a new version of the jpaserver-starter/docker hub image?</p>",
