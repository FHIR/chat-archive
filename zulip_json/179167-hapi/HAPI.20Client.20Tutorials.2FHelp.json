I was wondering if there is a site where there are further Examples and instructions on how to use HAPI Java Client other than the ones on <a href=\"http://hapifhir.io\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hapifhir.io\">hapifhir.io</a>. I'm currently struggeling to get a CodeSystem working. I'm using Java 8 and HAPI FHIR 3.4.0. I want to set up Codesystems (and various other Resources) before filling the server with patients and observations, etc to have a base of Metadata information available so that my patient resources can reference/use them. But even creating a CodeSystem with only one Code in it in Java proves to be hard enough for me to get frustrated at the task. Maybe you can point me to the right direction there. Regards, Kilian</p>",
