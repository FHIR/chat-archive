Now, when a certain patient-limit is exceeded for a patient reading, I need to send notifications to practitioners in the patient's <code>careteam</code>. </p>\n<p>What I did is, when I get a message from a device through a webhook callback, I lookup the FHIR device that has the device identifier, grab the patient ID, and then get the <code>careteam</code> and <code>practitioner</code>s in there. Once I have that, I am able to run some code that handles notifications (I fetch the practitioners, from the careteam too, since I store the notification IDs in the <code>Practitioner.identifier</code>). </p>\n<p>Now, for some of the questions I have. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a query that can directly return me the practitioners and the careteam, given device ID? I'm currently making 3 hops (<code>device</code> -&gt; <code>careteam</code> (using <code>device.patientid</code>) -&gt; <code>practitioner</code>s). I plan to use a bundle so that I can get this all in a single API call, but wanted to know if there was a better way</li>\n<li>I am storing the patent's limits in the device assigned to them as extensions, is that okay? </li>\n<li>I also need to update the code to facilitate preferences for <code>careteam</code> notifications, in the sense that when a measurement is out of bounds, I must send notif to only those practitioners in this <code>careteam</code> that have <code>yes</code>  stored somewhere. Where do I store this preference? I was thinking perhaps as a <code>base64</code> string  under the <code>careteam</code> as an extension, so that I need only fetch the <code>practitioner</code>s that have yes stored here.</li>\n</ul>",
