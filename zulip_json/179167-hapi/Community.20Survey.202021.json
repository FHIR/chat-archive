We'd really appreciate if you could take a few moments to fill this questionnaire out!</p>\n<p>The community survey helps us prioritize where we focus development, so it should be worth your while. We're also pondering when it'll be time to upgrade our minimum supported JDK from the current JDK 8, so if you have opinions on that we'd love to hear them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/hapi-survey\">https://bit.ly/hapi-survey</a></p>",
