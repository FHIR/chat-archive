I wish to define a RespRate resource provider so that my FHIR clients can access resp rate data by visiting the <a href=\"http://localhost:8080/RespRate\">http://localhost:8080/RespRate</a> endpoint, but I'm not sure how to do this with the given tutorial on Profiles and Extensions within Hapi FHIR: <a href=\"https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/docs/model/profiles_and_extensions.html\">https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/docs/model/profiles_and_extensions.html</a>. I'm using the starter code @ <a href=\"https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhirstarters/tree/master/java/hapi-fhirstarters-simple-server\">https://github.com/FirelyTeam/fhirstarters/tree/master/java/hapi-fhirstarters-simple-server</a>. </p>\n<p>I have a lot of metrics that fit within the Observation resource type so I need to distinguish them somehow. And should I be doing something with Structure Definitions too?</p>",
