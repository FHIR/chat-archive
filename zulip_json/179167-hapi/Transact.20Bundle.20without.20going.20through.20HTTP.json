My problem is that I have received a bundle over some other messaging channel and I now want to transact it. Right now I'm doing this by calling myself so to speak:</p>\n<p>client.transaction().withBundle(bundle).execute();</p>\n<p>This however is causing issues with the security layers on our platform. I have looked at the TransactionProcessor class inside the HAPI server, but this seems very much tied to the transaction happening due to an HTTP request.</p>",
