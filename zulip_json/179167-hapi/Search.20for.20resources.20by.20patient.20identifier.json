The dashboard must load quickly, and it runs hundreds of searches on the FHIR server to get the data. To speed up the loading, we try to have as many concurrent searches as possible and eliminate serial searches as much as possible. The dashboard is patient-centric, so all the data presented is for a single patient at a time. To avoid waiting to load the Patient resource, most of our searches look for resources using the patient identifier - such as \"/Observation?patient=xxxx\" where xxxx is the patient identifier (normally the MRN).<br>\nThe patient-identifier-based queries that we do work fine for Observations, reports etc. However, they do not work for Composition and QuestionnaireResponse resources. Is it possible we are using it incorrectly? Is there a different syntax for these resources, or is it not supported in HAPI, and why?</p>",
