See the changelog for a full list of changes. Notable changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HAPI FHIR now supports and requires JDK 8. Support for JDK 7 and below has officially been dropped.</li>\n<li>The R4 draft structures have been updated to the latest versions.</li>\n<li>Support for LOINC has been significantly improved thanks to a collaboration between the HAPI FHIR project and the Regenstrief Institute. The HAPI FHIR terminology service now imports LOINC parts, ValueSets, ConceptMaps, and all related artifacts.</li>\n<li>Support for the ConceptMap $translate method has been implemented, meaning that the terminology service now covers validation as well as translation use cases. Further enhancements are planned. A utility has also been added to the HAPI FHIR CLI for importing and exporting ConceptMaps as CSV files for external editing.</li>\n<li>Several index table enhancements have been made to the JPA server schema in anticipation of future changes that will improve performance and decrease index sizes. These enhancements consist of new columns that have been added and will be populated in HAPI FHIR 3.4.0 but will not actually be used until HAPI FHIR 3.5.0. Please see the changelog for an upgrade script that should be run.</li>\n<li>The HAPI FHIR CLI is now available for OSX users using Homebrew.</li>\n<li>The validation framework has been further harmonized so that DSTU2 resources will now also share the harmonized DSTU3/R4 validation codebase. This has resulted in a significantly more accurate validator for DSTU2 resources.</li>\n<li>A number of other enhancements have also been made, as well as several significant bugfixes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release!</p>\n<p>As a final note, I'd like to thank and introduce Diederik Muylwyk, who actually performed this release. Diederik will likely perform upcoming releases as well, so expect to see announcements from him.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nJames</p>",
