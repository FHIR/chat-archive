That seems reasonable, but I've left the ticket open on the FHIR spec because the section in question <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/conformance-definitions.html#Conformance.rest.operation.name\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/conformance-definitions.html#Conformance.rest.operation.name\">http://hl7.org/fhir/conformance-definitions.html#Conformance.rest.operation.name</a> isn't clear about this and could be better.</p>\n<p>However this means that HAPI should not include the $ prefix in <a href=\"http://Conformance.rest.operation.name\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Conformance.rest.operation.name\">Conformance.rest.operation.name</a></p>\n<p>FHIR Zulip chat</p>\n<hr>\n<p>implementers &gt; conformance</p>\n<p>Dion McMurtrie: FYI <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-email=\"grahame@healthintersections.com.au\">@Grahame Grieve</span> Grieve and @James Agnew, I just created <a href=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=9114\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=9114\">http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=9114</a> on <a href=\"http://Conformance.rest.operation.name\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://Conformance.rest.operation.name\">Conformance.rest.operation.name</a> inconsistency. The question is whether the \"$\" should prefix the name in this attribute - HAPI includes the \"$\", Health Intersections test FHIR server doesn't. Which is right?</p>\n<p>Grahame Grieve: DIon - I think that the docuemntation is specific, and that the name does not include the $</p>\n<p>Dion McMurtrie: Not from what I can see at <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/conformance-definitions.html#Conformance.rest.operation.name\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/conformance-definitions.html#Conformance.rest.operation.name\">http://hl7.org/fhir/conformance-definitions.html#Conformance.rest.operation.name</a> - it says \"The name of a query, which is used in the _query parameter when the query is called.\" and the comments are \"The name here SHOULD be the same as the name in the definition, unless there is a name clash and the name cannot be used.\"</p>\n<p>Dion McMurtrie: But maybe I'm not reading something into that I should be? Or perhaps there is another part of the spec which clarifies it?</p>\n<p>Grahame Grieve: \"Most Operations are a POST to a FHIR endpoint, where the name of the operations is prefixed by a \"dollar sign\" ('$') character\"</p>\n<p>Dion McMurtrie: OK, that works for me. I think a slightly more specific comment at <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/conformance-definitions.html#Conformance.rest.operation.name\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/conformance-definitions.html#Conformance.rest.operation.name\">http://hl7.org/fhir/conformance-definitions.html#Conformance.rest.operation.name</a> could avoid this inconsistency, even just a link to the text you just quoted. I'll raise a bug on HAPI.</p>\n</blockquote>",
