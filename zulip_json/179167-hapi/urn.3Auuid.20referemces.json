        "content": "<p>Hello,<br>\nI am running a FHIR Hapi server based off the JPA Example Server. I am loading data into it through a bundle which uses urn:uuid to reference resources. I am trying to query for ExplanationOfBenefit resource where the patient has a specific id (lets say \"1234\"). If the EOB resource in the server has the patient.reference = \"urn:uuid:1234\" then the query fhirBase/ExplanationOfBenefit?patient=1234 does not work. However, if I create a new EOB and post that to the server with the patient.reference = \"Patient/1234\" then the query works. Am I allowed to post bundles to the Hapi server which contain references using urn:uuid? Is there something in Hapi I need to do to automatically convert these? Or should this actually work as is?<br>\nThanks!</p>",
