It runs on a tomcat server and is available under https. </p>\n<p>When I try to simply search for a patient with hapi, I get a <code>NonFhirResponseException</code> with the message <code>Response contains no Content-Type</code>, but I don't know why. If I set up a new local server using the same database, tough not https but http, I don't get the error.<br>\nCan anyone help me please? Thanks in advance!</p>",
