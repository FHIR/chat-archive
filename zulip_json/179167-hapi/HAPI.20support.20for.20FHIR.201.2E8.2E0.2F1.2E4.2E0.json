In these builds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>hapi-fhir-structures-dstu3</code> has been updated to the FHIR 1.8.0 definitions</li>\n<li>Some new modules called <code>hapi-fhir-structures-dstu2.1</code> and <code>hapi-fhir-validation-resources-dstu2.1</code> have been added which now bring in native support for the FHIR 1.4.0 (Montreal) release.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our public server will be upgraded to use these new definitions within the next 12 hours, and I expect to push a final HAPI 2.2 release within the next few days.</p>",

I see that your public STU 3 server is now v 1.8.  There is no download for HAPI 2.2 on the project page, but as you indicated a few days ago, it has been pushed to Maven.  We'd like to set up a test server, just wondering when to do that?  Thx!</p>",
