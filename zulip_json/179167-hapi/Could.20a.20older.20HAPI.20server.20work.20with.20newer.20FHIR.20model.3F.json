We considered install new HAPI 4.1.0 server but we have many customization on the existing server and we don't want to start from scratch. So my tow questions:<br>\n1) Is it possible to run upgrade on existing HAPI server without losing all extensions, add-ons?<br>\n2) Is it possible to just upgrade FHIR model to 4.0.1 while using the existing HAPI FHIR server?<br>\nThanks</p>",
