Or fetch them from an API?</p>\n<p>Example: <a href=\"https://build.fhir.org/researchstudy.html\">https://build.fhir.org/researchstudy.html</a> has <code>status</code> which has a type in HAPI: <code>ResearchStudy.ResearchStudyStatus.INREVIEW</code><br>\nBut <code>primaryPurposeType</code> is a CodeableConcept and does not have a ready made type in HAPI.<br>\nHow can I integrate its definition (<a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-research-study-prim-purp-type.html\">http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-research-study-prim-purp-type.html</a>) without typing everything in code like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>val code = Coding()\n        .setSystem(&quot;http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/research-study-prim-purp-type&quot;)\n        .setVersion(&quot;4.5.0&quot;)\n        .setCode(&quot;supportive-care&quot;)\n        .setDisplay(&quot;Supportive Care&quot;)\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Thanks a lot in advance and hopefully have a good Monday :D</p>",
