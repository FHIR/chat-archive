However, I was wondering if there was a easier/faster way to be able to load all US Core Profiles at once, instead of one by one. Would a better route here be to load the US Core IG directly to my server? If so, how would one do this? Any knowledge here would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>P.S. I also saw in this chat someone talking about updating the HAPI FHIR application.yaml in order to validate against the US Core IG here:<br>\n<a href=\"#narrow/stream/179167-hapi/topic/HAPI.20RI.20support.20of.20latest.20US.20Core.20profiles/near/267010978\">https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179167-hapi/topic/HAPI.20RI.20support.20of.20latest.20US.20Core.20profiles/near/267010978</a></p>",
