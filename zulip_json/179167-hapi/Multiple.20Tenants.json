According to the snippet, adding multi tenancy capability requires adding functionality to the resource providers (filter on RequestDetails.getTenantId). </p>\n<p>As far as I can see, the included standard resource providers are generated from velocity templates. Should a project wanting to implement multi tenancy fork the HAPI FHIR repo and extend the vm templates accordingly? </p>\n<p>Trying to figure out what the best/ intended approach is to avoid too much hassle in the future when Hapi FHIR is updated. </p>\n<p>Thanks for any hint or for sharing your experience in this regard in advance!</p>",
