I am attempting to provide an HTTP endpoint.</p>\n<p>Looking at the documentation for HAPI, I don't see anything being mentioned for Subscriptions.</p>\n<p>Smile CDR's documentation however provides more information about subscriptions.</p>\n<p>Regarding the message channel subscriptions, the information is very limited. It looks like Smile CDR has message brokers that can be configured. I was wondering whether this can be achieved in HAPI (open source as well).</p>\n<p>Additional question: are the message channel types Subscriptions only limited to Smile CDR?</p>\n<p>How can I achieve publishing events to external event ingestion service using HAPI?</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191319\">@James Agnew</span> I would like to tag the HAPI guru.
