I'm trying to upload/update a CS in this way.  But HTTP code 400 (Bad request...) would be always returned from the JPA server when the size of loaded CS (i.e., a national edition of ICD-10, including more than 45k of concepts) part increase to a thredhold, such as nearly 20k and with about 40k properties.  Certainly, this method works for smaller CSs (e.g., thousands of concepts).  What do you think?</p>",
