To do that, we wrote out own validation support that feeds in the questionnaire and overrides <code>fetchResource</code> to return them. We chain it with a PrePopulatedValidationSupport and when we feed the answer value sets used by the questionnaires into the latter, everything works great. However, if the answer value sets are contained in the Questionnaire itself, the validator does not find it - it does not validate the code and emits the warning: \"ValueSet #valset not found by validator\". Here is an example of a valid Questionnaire provoking this: <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/P2zfJGw4DHfTE_Nw2kwxzYTl/test.json\">test.json</a> </p>\n<p>Is that a known limitation or is there a way to get it to work?</p>",
