I would prefer not to create another client within the project just to retrieve a streamed item (document, image, pdf...).</p>\n<p>Also how do you use the binary get resource to retrieve a stream.  When using something like this:<br>\nBinary binary = client.read().resource(Binary.class).withUrl(queryString).execute();</p>\n<p>I will receive an error for invalid content-type.  Is there a way to set the Binary to only accept a stream and not send the Accept header?</p>\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>-Conrad</p>",
