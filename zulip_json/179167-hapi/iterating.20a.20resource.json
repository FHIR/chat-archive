I have an api which in a nutshell takes a path 'Basic.meta.x' and returns whatever it finds at the point.  I'm having trouble though as I only seem to be able to access properties of a resource via the helper functions, which would mean for every property/resource I'd have to have a lot of special case code.  I've seen the function 'getAllPopulatedChildElementsOfType', but it takes a type rather than the name of the child.</p>\n<p>Thanks for any help</p>",
