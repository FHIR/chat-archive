I'm planning on making that change this week.</p>\n<p>HAPI 2.1 has been updated so that its client will accept both a <code>CapabilityStatement</code> or a <code>Conformance</code>. There is a <code>2.1-SNAPSHOT</code> build up on the global Maven repos with this fix now, and HAPI 2.1 will be release this week.</p>",
