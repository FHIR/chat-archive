However, I cannot figured out how to get the HAPI Generic client to NOT throw an exception when sending a POST to an endpoint that does little more than return 200 OK.  Is there something simple I'm missing?  It seems like telling the client that it's posting to $process-message in asynch way should do it, but I keep getting errors about no JSON in the response.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191319\">@James Agnew</span></p>",
