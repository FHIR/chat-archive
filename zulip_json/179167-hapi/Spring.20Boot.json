Sure, you're using the libraries, but I was looking more for example on how to run the jpa server from the <code>hapi-fhir-spring-boot-starter</code>. The samples located here: <a href=\"https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/tree/master/hapi-fhir-spring-boot\">https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/tree/master/hapi-fhir-spring-boot</a> unfortunately only stub out the <code>@SpringBoootApplication</code> with no additional context.</p>",

Curiously, do you know why using the <code>hapi-fhir-spring-boot-starter</code> isn't more documented? Seems like that would be a great launching point. Obviously the jpa-starter is fine too. I see it's just controlled based on the profiles.</p>",

The lack of documentation is probably due to how much you can do with Spring Boot. It would be time-consuming to document a lot of those use cases. Both Spring Boot and HAPI Fhir are huge tool kits and combining them is generates even more possibilities.</p>",
