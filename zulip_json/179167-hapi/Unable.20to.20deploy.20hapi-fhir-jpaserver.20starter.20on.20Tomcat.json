Using mvn clean install I have build the hapi fhir jpaserver starter project and copied hapi-fhir-jpaserver.war in the webapps directory of Tomcat. My tomcat runs on port 8080 and while trying to access the url <a href=\"http://localhost:8080/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/\">http://localhost:8080/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/</a> it gives 404 error.  On checking Tomcat Manager app the status for fhir-jpa-server project is false and on trying to start it I get error FAIL - Application at context path /hapi-fhir-jpaserver could not be started.</p>\n<p>I am able to run server using Maven and using command mvn -Djetty.port=8888 jetty:run but I want to deploy the project on external Web container(Tomcat)</p>\n<p>Is there some configuration changes that I need to make to deploy on an external web container like Tomcat?</p>",
