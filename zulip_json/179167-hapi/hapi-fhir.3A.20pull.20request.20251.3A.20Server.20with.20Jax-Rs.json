Looks amazing! I've also added you in as a committer so you can do any maintenance to it you need.</p>\n<p>In merging, I made one change to it. I don't think paging was working correctly as the patch stood. It required the URL to have the name of the resource in it, e.g.<br>\n<code>http://example.com/Patient?_getpages=foo</code><br>\ninstead of<br>\n<code>http://example.com?_getpages=foo</code></p>\n<p>A bunch of other things depend on the paging requests working from the root of the server so I fixed that.. but would you be able to look at what I did and see if it makes sense?</p>\n</blockquote>",

Thanks for merging and adding me as a commiter.</p>\n<p>I was struggling with the paging and the URL's (self, next, resource references, ..). It's good you found an elegant, working solution for the paging and the url's. </p>\n<p>You can remove the commented line 389 in Dstu2BundleFactory.java:<br>\n//          theServerBase = theCompleteUrl.contains(\"?\") ? theCompleteUrl.substring(0, theCompleteUrl.indexOf(\"?\")) : theCompleteUrl;</p>\n<p>Kind regards,</p>\n<p>Peter</p>\n</blockquote>",
