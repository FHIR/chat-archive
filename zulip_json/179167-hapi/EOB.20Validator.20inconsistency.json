I've been testing the hapi validator with the <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/explanationofbenefit.html\">ExplanationOfBenefits</a> resource type and ran into something a bit confusing. In my local 5.2.0 version of the hapi validator, the validator successfully caught an issue with my resource not having the <code>ExplanationOfBenefit.insurance.focal</code> field. When I sent that same resource through the test hapi fhir server <a href=\"https://hapi.fhir.org/\">here</a>, however, the resource was accepted just fine. Any idea as to why that might be?</p>",
