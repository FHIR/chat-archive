And yes, \"/fhir\" is in the web.xml, and to have it potentially be different in web.xml from the hapi.properties wouldn't be ideal. I would welcome a PR that re-introduced a hapi.properties property for server.base, and programmatically set the web.xml configuration dynamically based on the hapi.properties value. Otherwise, though, I don't think it makes sense to have it in two different places.</p>",
