We are trying to figure out how to meet the criteria of providing the end user with searchable access to both SNOMED and ICD9 and ICD10. I believe we have a handle on getting SNOMED into our FHIR server, however the additional requirement to support ICD9 and ICD10 has us spinning a bit. Has anyone added ICD9 and ICD10 as a CodeSystem to their FHIR server? Ideally we’re looking to build one field where the user can enter text or a code number and it returns a subset of results to choose from. Are we on the bleeding edge, or has someone implemented something like this successfully and can help guide our way? Thanks in advance.</p>",
