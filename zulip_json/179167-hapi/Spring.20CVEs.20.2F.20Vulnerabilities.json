That said, we do pull in the vulnerable library version so we're recommending people upgrade right away to be safe. HAPI FHIR users can just bump the spring dependencies up manually in their local project POM, so that's easy.</p>\n<p>CVE-2022-22963 is not a concern as we do not use Spring Cloud Function.</p>\n<p>CVE-2022-22950 is not a concern as we do not evaluate user supplied SpEL anywhere in the library.</p>",
