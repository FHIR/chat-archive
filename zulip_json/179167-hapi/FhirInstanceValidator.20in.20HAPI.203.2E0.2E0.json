I was following the documentation at <a href=\"http://hapifhir.io/doc_validation.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hapifhir.io/doc_validation.html\">http://hapifhir.io/doc_validation.html</a>. I started to write the code using HAPI 2.5 but switched to 3.0.0 and got compiler errors straight away.<br>\nTurns out FhirInstanceValidator has been removed in the 3.0.0 version of HAPI. That makes the above documentation obsolete.<br>\nBefore I start to dig into the HAPI source code to find out a new way of using our implementation of IValidationSupport can someone please help me how to do this in HAPI 3.0.0?<br>\nThanks!</p>",
