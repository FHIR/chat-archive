Roughly our goals are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ship a cross-platform UI so the user can run the validator.</li>\n<li>base that on a Web-UI so that in the background, it runs as web service</li>\n<li>the web service will be usable from another service as well - e.g. offer a validation web service for integration into * other FHIR servers (beyond the way it is already integrated into HAPI)</li>\n<li>we will make that available on the web at <a href=\"http://validation.fhir.org\">validation.fhir.org</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, integrate the web service into Zulip so you can ask for a validation report for resources in Zulip messages</p>",

We've been digging into using <a href=\"http://packages.fhir.org\">packages.fhir.org</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/inferno-community/fhir-validator-app/pull/29\">have a PR</a> that will make it able to support any IG on <a href=\"http://package.fhir.org\">package.fhir.org</a> (we use <code>FilesystemPackageCacheManager::listAllIds</code> to get the NPM package Ids).  That PR is ready, but it just hasn't been reviewed/merged yet (should be in by the end of the week).  We also have another branch in the works that will allow users to upload a <code>package.tgz</code> to support IGs not on <a href=\"http://packages.fhir.org\">packages.fhir.org</a>.</p>\n<p>The hosted version on <a href=\"http://inferno.healthit.gov/validator\">inferno.healthit.gov/validator</a> hasn't been updated yet with any of this yet.
