Everything Patrick and Jens describe work for the Profile <code>MI-I Patient</code> - I happened to click through to the source repository first and the logical model fit what I thought you were asking about.</p>\n<p>Loading the profile into HAPI will let the server support it and even validate it (using code such as the great example from Jens).</p>\n<p>If you want to access an element such as <code>versichertenId_GKV</code> in your code, it does not have a 'first class' way of accessing it, you need to look at the <code>Patient.identifer</code> values, search for one with the matching pattern, and go from there.  That is the part of the project I am working on - to hopefully make that layer easier.  It is unfortunately quite a bit of work to get that working though  =).</p>",
