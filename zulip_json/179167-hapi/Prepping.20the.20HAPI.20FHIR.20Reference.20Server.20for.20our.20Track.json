We were told we could add profiles to the reference server as well as search parameters.  How do we do that?<br>\nAlso, does the reference server support subscriptions?  Thanks</p>",

HAPI will then automatically consume the content and be usable for instance validation for your resources.</p>\n<p>Regarding the SearchParameters: under default circumstances a HAPI FHIR server can also be enriched with extra search parameters by posting instances of the SearchParameter to the proper endpoint - eg. <a href=\"https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/SearchParameter\">https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/SearchParameter</a>. It seems like this feature has been disabled on the global test server - and for valid reasons. You might be able to convince <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191319\">@James Agnew</span> to allow it for a short period of time, but I'll leave that between you two.</p>",
