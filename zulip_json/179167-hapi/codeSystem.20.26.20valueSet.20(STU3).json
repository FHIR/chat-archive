FHIR offers many of the facilities that we would require (such as querying via an API, auditing, distinguishing between code system &amp; value sets etc.). However, there are some challenges to overcome with the code sets we want to manage, which we are working through. Although 90% of the code sets conform to a code/value pair, which are straight forward to incorporate into a codeSystem, there are some code sets that have code/value/notes and some code sets that have structure within them, such as nesting of codes. I've put an example codeSystem of the nesting issue on the Canadian public FHIR server (<a href=\"http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu3/CodeSystem/111052\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu3/CodeSystem/111052\">http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu3/CodeSystem/111052</a>), and an example of a valueSet that includes this codeSystem (<a href=\"http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu3/ValueSet/111111\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu3/ValueSet/111111\">http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu3/ValueSet/111111</a>). The codeSystem has nested codes. When you expand the valueSet (do a GET on <a href=\"http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu3/ValueSet/111111/$expand\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu3/ValueSet/111111/$expand\">http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/baseDstu3/ValueSet/111111/$expand</a>) all the nesting in the codeSystem is lost, and the codes appear in a flat list.<br>\nIt was my hope that if you put nested codes into a codeSystem, you'd get out nested codes when you retrieved them.<br>\nHope that makes things clearer</p>",

That is not how a code system should do this - use additional space as the relationship that links a child to a parent. What I see is a visual metaphore for something that should be computable. In real code systems a hierarchy is a specialized type of relationship where the code system has defined content that uses a named relationship to link concepts AND then says that relationship is hierarchical (transitive is ussually what is meant.) So I don't see that information in the link <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"192158\">@Dave Barnet</span> has provided so I suspect the computability of the hierarchy is missing. I am not an expert on what FHIR supports for all this but is the code system shown somehow legally defining a hierarchy in FHIR? </p>",

An expansion is the resulting expansion code set PLUS any addition information about the concept (or information related to the concept) you need to use. Any number of value set definitions can result in the same expansion code set. The FHIR community is STRONGLY encourage to continue to align with this - as Graham has done (with some grumbling) to date - thank you Graham.

If we had captured \"transivity\" of the assumed relation I am definitely been in favor of identifying that. Let's not dwell on the past... However we can identify that the unstated hierarchy relation is transitive we should do that. But I'd say that we are likely VERY safe in assuming that anything you all make using such a notation will be transitive so this practice simply needs to be documented (I.E.: The FHIR default (un-named) nested hierarchy is always transitive.) </p>",

Are you saying that subsumption is a more general \"grouped by\" operation and transitive is limited to \"Is-A\"? I'm assuming that is not what you mean because if subsumption = \"grouped by” then subsumption means having a hierarchy.
