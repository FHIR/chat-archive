Any advice on this would be much appreciated.</p>",

The only exception to this is if the second is marked <code>version=true</code> then a VRead client call (e.g. <code>GET base/Patient/1/_history/1</code>) will be routed to the second.</p>\n<p>This kind of mirrors how FHIR works though. There isn't really a concept in FHIR of a \"read by profile\". When you do a read, you do it by ID and whatever profiles that read has are the ones that get returned. You can do a search by profile, is that what you're looking for?</p>",
