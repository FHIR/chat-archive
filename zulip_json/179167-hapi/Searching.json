I'm just trying to test out what works and as part of it I've performed the query '{{URL}}/Basic?_profile=http://stelar.org/StructureDefinition/stelar/profile/questionResponse', where we have about 370000 instances of basic.  The result is a 504 timeout however.  How do I increase the timeout time?  Is there a way to increase the performance of the query?  I'm not actually sure if it's trying to return all the matching resources, or just their id's, but either would be fine</p>",

Right now, one limitation of HAPI's JPA design is that it loads all results for your search into a staging table before returning. If you have a query that returns 300k results that is definitely going to be slow. We have a bunch of code in progress to address this limitation, so hopefully that will get a lot faster in the next release.</p>",
