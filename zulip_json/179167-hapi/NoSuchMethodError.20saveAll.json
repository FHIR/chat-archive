I've got the hapi server up and running and I've created a Patient resource in the database, which I can query using GET /fhir/Patient/1 successfully.  However when I attempt to execute a search on Patients, regardless of what query params I seem to supply I'm getting an error: </p>\n<p>java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: ca.uhn.fhir.jpa.dao.data.ISearchResultDao.saveAll(Ljava/lang/Iterable;)Ljava/util/List;</p>\n<p>That looks very much like a dependency versioning issue to my naive eyes, but I've confirmed that all the hapi jars are from the 3.6.0 packages so I'm not sure where else to look.</p>\n<p>Can anyone offer any insight or help as to where I might look for more info?</p>\n<p>Many thanks in advance!</p>",
