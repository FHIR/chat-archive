When looking at the collection of XClientParam classes I found that there is only a class DateClientParam but not DateTimeClientParam. Can the DateClientParam also be used for DateTimes or would I have to add a new coresponding ClientParam class ? Further classes I am unsure about which ClientParam class to use are: boolean, Identifier, Period, Range, CodeableConcept. Perhaps for some of them the CompositeClientParam should be used.</p>",
