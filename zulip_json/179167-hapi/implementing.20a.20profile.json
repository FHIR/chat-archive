If I did a code generator, it would be a facade to the resource, not a sub-class. Note that - it's a mistake to think of a profile as as sub-class. </p>\n<p>but more generally, the profile is set of rules that apply to the use of the resource and it's often relevent to be subject to more than one set of rules - so quite often it just turns out that the profile is a set of rules for your code too</p>",
