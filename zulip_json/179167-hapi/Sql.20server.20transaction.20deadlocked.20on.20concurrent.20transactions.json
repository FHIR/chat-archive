Each transaction has bundle of 100 resources being saved as a resource type batch. It seems to happen in SQL server, but not in HSQL db in-memory.  Is this deadlock issue  due to the unique way that Spring JPA deals with SQL server's transaction? Has anyone else run into a similar issue or the same issue?</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/3g07AeGTJTeIoCe87KqCzLWo/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pasted_image.png\">pasted image</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/3g07AeGTJTeIoCe87KqCzLWo/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pasted image\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/3g07AeGTJTeIoCe87KqCzLWo/pasted_image.png\"></a></div>",
