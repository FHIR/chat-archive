I've created some profiles using Forge and now want to use them in a fresh installation of the starter project.</p>\n<p>When I try to post a resource of one of these new profiles, HAPI is always telling me \"Incorrect resource type found\".  I was under the impression that I just have to put the xml structure definitions of the profiles somewhere and it would work. I have already posted the profiles to the StructureDefinition endpoint, but this does not seem to be enough.</p>\n<p>Can anybody point me in the right direction? Thanks a lot!</p>",
