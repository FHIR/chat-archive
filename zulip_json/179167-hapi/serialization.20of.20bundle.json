However when using this code:<br>\nFileOutputStream f_out = new FileOutputStream(\"myobject.data\");<br>\nObjectOutputStream obj_out = new ObjectOutputStream(f_out);<br>\nobj_out.writeObject ( bundle );<br>\nI get a <br>\njava.io.NotSerializableException: org.hl7.fhir.utilities.xhtml.XhtmlNode$Location<br>\nWhen looking at the class XhtmlNode I see that the class itself implements Serializable but the inline class Location does not. Is this some kind of bug or do I do something wrong/forbidden ?<br>\nGreetings</p>",
