Specifically, <code>/ValueSet/cn-condition-code/$expand?filter=blood</code> respects the filter, however the one we need to use does not: <code>/fhir-server/ValueSet/$expand?filter=blood&amp;url=https://ourdomain.io/api/v1/fhir/ValueSet/cn-condition-code</code><br>\nBoth work with normal valueSets, but the second one does not. Any suggestions on getting it to work, or is this a bug in HAPI FHIR 5.0.2?<br>\n(FYI the custom condition code valueSet is just a modified version of US Core Condition Code that excludes ICD-10)</p>",
