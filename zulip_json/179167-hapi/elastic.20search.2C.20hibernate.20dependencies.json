It looks like however that the hibernate-search dependency is still version 5.11.5 which supports up through elasticsearch 5.x. We're wondering if this is stating a sort of unofficial support of up to elasticsearch 6.5.4 in hapi 5.1.0-SNAPSHOT or is the 5.1.0 release hinging on hibernate search version 6.x which supports up through elasticsearch 7.x?</p>",
