For data retrieval, I need to map some of these classes to my model's resource classes using my own fhirversion.properties file instead of the default one. I have tried several methods within Gradle to replace the properties file with my own, but can't get it to work. I was wondering if there was some mechanism within Hapi to say \"hey the fhirversion.properties I want to use is here\". <br>\nThanks</p>",
