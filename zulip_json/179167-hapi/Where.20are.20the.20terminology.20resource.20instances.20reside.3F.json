Thanks for any hints.</p>\n<p>For a concept's properties of the various datatypes (i.e., valueCode, valueCoding, valueString, valueInteger, valueBoolean, valueDateTime, valueDecimal),  only the first three of them would be inserted into the table trm_concept_property.  It seems that the storage process would ignore processing the other types.  So for such types of concept properties, where to find their data? Using the resource XML/JSON instance blob? Then where are these blobs if yes?</p>\n<p>[Note] The answer has been found in HAPI FHIR's docs.</p>",
