There are 3 results each missing the mandatory elements.(subject and intent) . If I try to HTTP POST an entry with the mandatory items missing, I get the error that it is expecting the elements (\"minimum required = 1, but only found 0\") but it still creates the record. Is this meant to happen?</p>",

It does validate your POST (and you'll note that the OperationOutcome that is returned includes these validation failures) but the create isn't actually blocked.</p>\n<p>In a real system this can be tightened of course (most easily by changing the failure mode settings in RequestValidationInterceptor) but the public test server is lenient.</p>",
