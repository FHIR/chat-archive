However, when I expand the ValueSet the displays are not coming back as the custom display set in the ValueSet. When I make a manual CodeSystem with some fields and try out the same setup with another ValueSet it properly overrides the display. Is the uploaded CodeSystem different fundamentally/restricted in some ways? (Does it have to do with the content? The content is not-present on the uploaded SNOMED CodeSystem, while my custom ones are present)<br>\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/RingOfStorms/e90a406c15dd08cd8ea75925058e468b\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/RingOfStorms/e90a406c15dd08cd8ea75925058e468b\">https://gist.github.com/RingOfStorms/e90a406c15dd08cd8ea75925058e468b</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/Kh8y7H3DGIeQX7U0xE0Dsg9I/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pasted_image.png\">pasted image</a> <br>\nAs you can see the displays are not MMM... and FFF... as they should be.</p>\n<p>If I make a custom CodeSystem and test it manually it works as I expected&gt; POST CodeSystem: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/RingOfStorms/d587452b55c17c91b6fbe438f225d885\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/RingOfStorms/d587452b55c17c91b6fbe438f225d885\">https://gist.github.com/RingOfStorms/d587452b55c17c91b6fbe438f225d885</a><br>\nPOST ValueSystem: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/RingOfStorms/924d7d5496e3abe8921de67e9b4ce8ab\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/RingOfStorms/924d7d5496e3abe8921de67e9b4ce8ab\">https://gist.github.com/RingOfStorms/924d7d5496e3abe8921de67e9b4ce8ab</a><br>\nAnd then Expanding GET works: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/RingOfStorms/6b542136eba061bcedb68f7298f971e1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/RingOfStorms/6b542136eba061bcedb68f7298f971e1\">https://gist.github.com/RingOfStorms/6b542136eba061bcedb68f7298f971e1</a></p>\n<p>What am I missing with the uploaded CodeSystem?</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/Kh8y7H3DGIeQX7U0xE0Dsg9I/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pasted image\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/10155/Kh8y7H3DGIeQX7U0xE0Dsg9I/pasted_image.png\"></a></div>",
