For a long time the only way to have search parameters in a resource provider class was to statically compile them in. Then we added the ability to add them programatically to the server (which we needed in order to support custom search parameters via the SearchParameter resource). So now we support both ways. Continuing to maintain the code generated RPs doesn't add much at this point.</p>",
