Upon starting one of our services a searchparameter is initialized by entering it into my searchParameterDao (We currently do it by making a put request with a SearchParameter json). Our problem arise when we attempt to test a service using mvn clean test. It seems as if  the service doesn't recognize the parameter on first startup after a clean, as we get a \"Unknown search parameter subjectIdentifier for resource type CarePlan\" - however if the server is restarted before the search parameter is used it works fine.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to enter a SearchParameter into the SearchParameter dao and have it work immediately?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
