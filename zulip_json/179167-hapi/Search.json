I can see that there is a way to express allowUnknownParams=true to tell the URL parser to allow unknown parameters, so that seems like a good starting point.  What I'm wondering is if there is code I can reuse in the Server to parse the URL parameters given in search.</p>",

I'm certain HAPI already does this, and I can certainly find the code that does it.
