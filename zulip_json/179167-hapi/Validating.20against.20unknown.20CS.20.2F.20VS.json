But when I Parse the JSON String back to the Observation I cannot cast the Specimen in the Observation to the ExSpecimen class - in this case the problem is the Extension of Specimen in Observation cause problem, with the extension of the Observation is OK  if we use the function parseResource(Class&lt;T&gt; theResourceType, String theString)). You have any experience with that? I think this is a very common case in the Real World.  Thanks very much for your support</p>",
