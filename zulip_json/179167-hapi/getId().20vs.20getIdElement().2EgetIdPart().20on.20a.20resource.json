New to HAPI and trying to understand why, when trying to retrieve the id element (logical id not Identifier) of a resource, the getId() method is returning a URL (or perhaps more accurately, why the behaviour of the getId() is designed this way).</p>\n<p>If my resource looks like this: </p>\n<p>\"resourceType\": \"Patient\",<br>\n  \"id\": \"4af350f43c854fceacd4b920498b004e\",<br>\n  \"meta\": {<br>\n    \"versionId\": \"2\",<br>\n    \"lastUpdated\": \"2021-10-04T12:57:35.785-04:00\"<br>\n  },<br>\n  \"text\": {... etc.</p>\n<p>Calling patient.getId() returns <a href=\"https://wildfhir4.aegis.net/fhir4-0-1/Patient/4af350f43c854fceacd4b920498b004e/_history/2\">https://wildfhir4.aegis.net/fhir4-0-1/Patient/4af350f43c854fceacd4b920498b004e/_history/2</a> - not what I expected. </p>\n<p>To get the actual <a href=\"http://Patient.id\">Patient.id</a> element (i.e. return just \"4af3...4e\"), you have to call: patient.getIdElement().getIdPart()</p>\n<p>Looking through the HAPI javadoc it looks like this is intentional. What is the thinking behind this / what is the use case for .getId()? Why is the id an IdPart in getIdElement()?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
