The problem is that every resource can claim to be conformant in their meta tag. Or they can conform and not declare it in the meta tag. Profiles are meant to validate, not search on.<br>\nI couldn't follow your question 100% because I don't know with: \"profile contains resources\" Profiles don't contain resources, resources are conformant to profiles.<br>\nBut if i understand you correct, you want to GET <a href=\"http://test.fhir.org/r4/Patient/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://test.fhir.org/r4/Patient/\">http://test.fhir.org/r4/Patient/</a>  -  this will give you all Patients no matter to which profile they are declaring conformance.</p>",
