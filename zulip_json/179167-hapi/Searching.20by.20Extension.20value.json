To cut a long story short, all of my data is based on Basic, all of the data conforms to custom profiles I have created on Basic, and all of the data has 'custom' properties, which I've implemented by adding extensions to the profiles.  My question is, what are all of the steps to allow me to search through Basic and filter my result based on the value of an extension?  My data will live within an instance of the HAPI server</p>\n<p>As an example; Suppose I have a profile defined for capturing Speed trap data.  The data required is vehicle reg (String), and speed (Decimal).  I want to search for all Basic resources which have a _profile or 'SpeedTrap' and a speed of over 30.0.  p.s. This is just an example for clarity, I'm not actually capturing speed data.</p>\n<p>My resources look something like this:<br>\n-Basic<br>\n  -Extension[..../VehicleReg]<br>\n    -valueString: \"VXH88GH\"<br>\n  -Extension[..../Speed]<br>\n    -valueDecimal: 31.0</p>\n<p>In the implementer stream someone mentioned that I need to create a searchParameter for speed, so I've looked into doing that and think I have created something valid.  They also mentioned something about conformance rules.</p>\n<p>Could someone either give me (or link me to) a step by step of how to do this in HAPI?</p>",
