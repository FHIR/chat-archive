I have made some very minor alterations to the HAPI JPA starter including registering our IG (<a href=\"https://github.com/pnrobinson/hapi-pheno-server\">https://github.com/pnrobinson/hapi-pheno-server</a>; the IG is here <a href=\"http://phenopackets.org/core-ig/\">http://phenopackets.org/core-ig/</a>). I start the server on localhost for testing. Then I try to work with the server with client code (<a href=\"https://github.com/pnrobinson/hapi-pheno-client/\">https://github.com/pnrobinson/hapi-pheno-client/</a>). WHen I try to post a custom resource like this<br>\nPhenotypicFeature pf = new PhenotypicFeature();<br>\n        pf.setId(\"id\");<br>\n        IGenericClient  client = ctx .newRestfulGenericClient(this.hapiUrl);<br>\n        client.registerInterceptor(loggingInterceptor);<br>\n        MethodOutcome<br>\n                outcome = client<br>\n                .create()<br>\n                .resource(pf)<br>\n                .execute();<br>\n        return outcome.getId();<br>\nI get a 404: <br>\n ca.uhn.fhir.rest.server.exceptions.ResourceNotFoundException: HTTP 404 Not Found<br>\n...<br>\nThe resource has this -- <br>\n@ResourceDef(name=\"Observation\",<br>\n        profile=\"<a href=\"https://github.com/phenopackets/core-ig/StructureDefinition/PhenotypicFeature\">https://github.com/phenopackets/core-ig/StructureDefinition/PhenotypicFeature</a>\")<br>\npublic class PhenotypicFeature extends Observation {<br>\n///<br>\n}<br>\nANy ideas/tips would be greatly appreciated, Peter</p>",
