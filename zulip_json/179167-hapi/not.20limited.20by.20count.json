        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"194320\">@Srinath ramarathnam</span> , if you are using your own copy of HAPI server, look at the DSTU3 config file. From the answer of James to a similar question: \"If you want your client to get a huge page size, call \"setMaximumPageSize(5000)\" and then include \"&amp;_count=5000\" in your URL. Alternately you could certainly disable paging entirely on the server if you wanted by calling \"setPagingProvider(null)\". You're taking a risk then, since if a given search returns a million results the server will load them all into memory and potentially run out, but if you are controlling the entire stack that might not be a concern.\"</p>",
