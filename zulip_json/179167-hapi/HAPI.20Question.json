You could implement your own database layer using HAPI server (but not JPA). You could also find a way to give them a reliable ID so that you don't need to contain them.</p>",

Is this recommended or we shall define Custom operation that takes the bundle payload  ?<br>\nIf so then how we interpret meaning of CRUD operation for Bundle Resource  since its just collection of actual resource so there is no resource id or modeling in data represent the resource structure as is.</p>\n<p>Also since Bundle is collection of resource so does HAPI  server implementation provide out of box feature that allows to split the external request and  route individual resource request to respective resource end point internally ?</p>\n<p>Any information in this area will be helpful.</p>\n<p>Thanks !</p>",
