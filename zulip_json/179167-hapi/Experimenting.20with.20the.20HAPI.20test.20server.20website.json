One possible thing is the possibility to add parameters to the search. Via the drop-down-list elements of the resource can be additionallly contrained. But when I select \"birthdate\" the additional GUI parts vanish that let be define a desired birthdate (I would like to enter somthing like \"50\" or \"&gt; 50\"). When I select \"deceased\" there are additonal GUI parts that let me constrain the elements. But I can only define a code system and a code for the boolean value deceased.<br>\nHow is the search interface intended to be used correctly ?<br>\nGreetings<br>\nGeorg</p>",
