The new site is finally live at<br>\n<a href=\"https://hapifhir.io\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hapifhir.io\">https://hapifhir.io</a></p>\n<p>Among other things, the HAPI FHIR documentation has been completely rewritten, including an all new section on the new interceptor framework and lots of new detail on validation. We're now using a markdown-based format which should make it easier for people to contribute - See the docs sources if you're curious ( <a href=\"https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/tree/master/hapi-fhir-docs/src/main/resources/ca/uhn/hapi/fhir/docs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/tree/master/hapi-fhir-docs/src/main/resources/ca/uhn/hapi/fhir/docs\">https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/tree/master/hapi-fhir-docs/src/main/resources/ca/uhn/hapi/fhir/docs</a> ). The JavaDocs have also been fixed and modernized, as they have been broken for a while.<br>\nWe've also finally launched our Global Atlas on the homepage. If your project isn't already on it, we'd love for it to be! There is a link on the homepage showing how to submit.</p>\n<p>Finally, for the curious, we're open sourcing our style guide too: <a href=\"https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/wiki/Website-Style-Guide\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/wiki/Website-Style-Guide\">https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/wiki/Website-Style-Guide</a></p>\n<p>Feedback is welcome!</p>",
