Is this possible? Another wrinkle is that when called on their own they require the $expand command to get all the values. So ideally I'm looking to create a single network call that will return the $expand valueSets for ValueSet/condition-category, ValueSet/condition-ver-status, and ValueSet/condition-clinical. Any suggestions?</p>",
