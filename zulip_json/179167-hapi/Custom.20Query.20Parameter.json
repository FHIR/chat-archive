I'm talking about FHIR Server in the box form of HAPI, not the framework where you could build your own server.  I want to know if this can be done through configuration rather than code, and if so, where I'd find that documentation.  The SANER project is interested in learning if this is an available feature.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191319\">@James Agnew</span></p>",

I wrote up the process in a blog post here: <a href=\"https://blog.smilecdr.com/2017/02/08/custom-search-parameters-in-hapi-fhir/\" title=\"https://blog.smilecdr.com/2017/02/08/custom-search-parameters-in-hapi-fhir/\">https://blog.smilecdr.com/2017/02/08/custom-search-parameters-in-hapi-fhir/</a></p>\n<p>The post includes Java code to create the SP resource but that's not a requirement, it just needs to be uploaded via the REST interface.</p>\n<p>I know I have seen other IGs include SP resources as a part of their content. I am working on a package importer for HAPI, maybe getting this all wired together could be my contribution to SANER.</p>",
