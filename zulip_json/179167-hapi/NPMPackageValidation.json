I am currently not able to find a reference to this library in the global maven repository.<br>\nThe validation packages and resources can be included as expected, but the npm is missing.<br>\nAs it is stated in the javadoc, this is available since Version 5.5.0, but in the maven repository it is 5.4.9 I think this may be the issue. Do you have any hints how to use it right now?</p>",
