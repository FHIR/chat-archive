        "content": "<p>It looks like if you have multiple Resource providers that both implement the same Operation, what you get in the capability statement is a mixture of both. For example \"Patient\" and \"Encounter\" both support \"$everything\". This is what the capability statement looks like in <a href=\"https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/metadata\">https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/metadata</a> :</p>\n<p>\"operation\": [ {<br>\n        \"name\": \"everything\",<br>\n        \"definition\": \"<a href=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/OperationDefinition/EncounterPatient-it-everything\">http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/OperationDefinition/EncounterPatient-it-everything</a>\"<br>\n      }</p>\n<p>It shows up both under Patient and Encounter \"Operation\"s. And if you click through you get a union of the operation parameters of both resources. What's the logic behind this? Shouldn't the OperationDefinition be per resource?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",
