The @OperationParam annotation with the parameter in the operation method signature doesn't seem to do it.</p>\n<p>Similarly, is there a way to occasionally return a blank 200 response from the operation without manually handling the servlet response?  Most of the time we'll return a resource.</p>\n<p>(Use case here is implementing the $process-messages endpoint)</p>",
