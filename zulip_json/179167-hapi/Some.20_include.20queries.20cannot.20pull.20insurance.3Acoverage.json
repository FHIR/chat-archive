It works for an instance of DeviceRequest, but not for ServiceRequest or MedicationRequest. We've been running this on a local HAPI server on version 5.4.0.</p>\n<p>This example query features a DeviceRequest that tries to get the insurance coverage, and is successful.<br>\n<code>http://localhost:8080/test-ehr/r4/DeviceRequest?_include=DeviceRequest:insurance:Coverage</code></p>\n<p>This example features a ServiceRequest that tries to get the insurance coverage, but is unsuccessful.<br>\n<code>http://localhost:8080/test-ehr/r4/ServiceRequest?_id=servreq-g0180-1&amp;_include=ServiceRequest:insurance:Coverage</code><br>\nIt successfully pulls other _includes like Patient/Practitioner/etc and the resource in the insurance field is of type Coverage.</p>\n<p>The fhir resources for both are in the same structure with similar fields. Any idea why this might be working in some cases but not others? </p>\n<p>I also tried the same query to <a href=\"http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4\">http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4</a>:<br>\n<code>http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/DeviceRequest?_id=93947&amp;_include=DeviceRequest:patient&amp;_include=DeviceRequest:insurance:Coverage</code><br>\nBut didn't get back either the Coverage, Patient, or any other _includes even though they're in that 93947 resource.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>",
