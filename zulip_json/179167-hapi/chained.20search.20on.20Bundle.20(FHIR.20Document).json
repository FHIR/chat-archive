Same result.<br>\nThe same request, I tried on the vonk test server, with the result that it returned all bundles regardless of the subject.</p>\n<p>The bundle I used was the example document from the fhir specs, as well as several others. </p>\n<p>On Observation the parameter chaining works fine (eg GET Observation?subject.family=SMITH). Is this not possible with References?<br>\nOr did I missunderstand something and such a request is not valid/impossible?</p>\n<p>I would appreciate any support.
