I am trying to validate these profiles on their way through my system. So I've got two questions:</p>\n<p>1. Can I add my validation to the base validation - 'on entry'?</p>\n<p>2. How do you solve validating? I've tried loading the SD's from my resource folder etc, but I'm not able to make the system choose correct schema, and if I force it - it doesn't recognise it as a valid FHIR resource. Really frustrating.</p>\n<p>Hope I'm not the only one not getting this, and if I am not, maybe this should be further documented in the HAPI docs.</p>",

Grahame has developed a transform which produces a FHIR Bundle of type Document which contains the Composition Resource and any accompanying resources needed to compose the fHIR document from the supplied C-CDA.  I've attached one document bundle example.  Went I attempted to post this bundle on the HAPI server, I got a message that Bundles of type Document are not supported.  What  is the correct way to post a document to HAPI? <a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/88GQb9Y4uBkJFreX-Lqt7OUL/test-allscripts-iataug2018.xml\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"test-allscripts-iataug2018.xml\">test-allscripts-iataug2018.xml</a></p>",
