We have around 7 million unique records.<br>\nThe FHIR server is very slow at deleting them - we have tried multiple solutions. We have implemented every performance recommendation available in the docs.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Expunge - handles about 8000 records per a few minutes (very slow)</li>\n<li>Expunge delete - similar to 1</li>\n<li>We are thinking of updating the records on the database - the res_deleted_at element and expunging the deleted versions - this seems faster<br>\nIs there a way to speed up the process or any alternative solution to make the bulk deleting faster?</li>\n</ol>",
