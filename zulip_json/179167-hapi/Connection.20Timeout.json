It's getting a lot of timeouts connecting to the server. I have a connection timeout of up to 5-10 seconds, and a socket timeout of 60sec+, and the server is ready and  waiting, and none of my other clients (browsers, postman, etc) are having any trouble connecting. And I can't even debug this - it always works when I try to step it.</p>\n<p>So I'm kind of inclined to think that the problem might be in the java code. But I don't know how to investigate further. Does anyone have any magic knowledge here?</p>",
