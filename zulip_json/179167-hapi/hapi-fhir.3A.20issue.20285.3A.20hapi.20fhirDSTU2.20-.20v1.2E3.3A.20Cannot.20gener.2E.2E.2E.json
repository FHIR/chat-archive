Look at the ServerProfileProvider#getProfileById, in this read method, it get the id by theId.getValue() but it will return the id value like as \"StructureDefinition/id\" not the \"id\", so the resource \"StructureDefinition/id\" is not known. I think to get the id should be like \"theId.getIdPart()\".</p>\n</blockquote>",

Then, there is another issue related it that I want your comments. The profile of DSTU1 has been replaced with StructureDefinition in DSTU2. But it could only set the id into the structureDefinition, see the code of FhirDstu2#generateProfile, not like the FhirDstu1. Is it correct or something is still in progress?</p>\n</blockquote>",

I'm hoping we'll get this back soon, but unfortunately the profile/structure definition changed so much between DSTU1 and DSTU2 that the old code had to be scrapped. Hopefully we'll see this feature return in a new version of HAPI soon.</p>\n</blockquote>",
