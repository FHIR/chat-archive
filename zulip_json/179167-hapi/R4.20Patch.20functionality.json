I created the following bugs after those: <a href=\"https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/2897\">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/2897</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/2918\">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/2918</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/2919\">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/2919</a>.<br>\nThe links to the discussions are also attached to the bugs.<br>\nCould you confirm those are the issues? <br>\nOr at least maybe you could look at the last one, since it seems to be most critical, since I couldn't find any workarounds about it. (the first two could work with workarounds to use insert and timeDateTime name).</p>",
