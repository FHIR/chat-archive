The supplier I'm working with and at least two versions from another supplier (I used to work for) doesn't follow this model (a gp issues a drug, they may plan an issue but normally they dont). <br>\nThe only way of following the spec is to create synthetic issues with a status of plan (but note I will have real planned issues).</p>\n<p>As a consumer I will also need to filter out the synthetic  planned issues (wouldn't want to display/have duplicate/synthetic issues), however I only need to do that if I'm not using MedicationStatement.</p>\n<p>I believe the spec is wrong in enforcing this model and interested in views?</p>",
