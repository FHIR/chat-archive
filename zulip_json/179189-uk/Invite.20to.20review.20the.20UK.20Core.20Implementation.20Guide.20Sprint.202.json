This will then be part of a Minimum Viable Product release of a candidate ‘HL7 FHIR UK Core Implementation Guide R4’ which would be published via HL7 UK and would ultimately go through an HL7 UK ballot process. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key value of this Clinical and Technical Assurance process is to have a multi-disciplinary collaboration in an agile team and provide the ability to improve the quality of the product for all. It helps stakeholders, including vendors, to understand the rationale and details behind the design based on use cases. The vendors can raise implementation issues and resolve these issues before the specifications are published. The process promotes consistency in FHIR assets across different programmes and use cases to support interoperability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The current schedule for the Sprint 2 (all dates in 2021) is as below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proposed review pack review <blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial kick off call: 23rd February 11:00-13:00</li>\n<li>Second call: 25th February 11:00-13:00</li>\n<li>Third call (Contingency): 2nd March 11:00-13:00</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Publication of final review pack: 8th March</li>\n<li>Wider community review period of final review pack: 3 weeks, 8th - 26th March</li>\n<li>Consolidated feedback review and disposition call: 9th April 9:30-11:30</li>\n<li>Retro/Lessons Learned call: 16th April :10:00-11:00</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Option 1: Register interest in joining the three calls starting on the 23rd February, where you will be given access to the proposed ‘review pack’ at the first call and can input into a final ‘review pack’ with a planned release date of 8th March. You can also join the call on 9th April to discuss consolidated feedback on the final ‘review pack’.</p>\n<p>Option 2: Register interest in being sent details of the final ‘review pack’ that will be released on the 8th March and be part of a review panel where you can submit feedback on the specification by the 26th March. You will also be able to join the call on the 9th April to discuss the consolidated feedback.</p>\n<p>If you would like to register your interest to be involved, please email us with your preferred option at <a href=\"mailto:interoperabilityteam@nhs.net\">interoperabilityteam@nhs.net</a> and we will send you the invites.</p>\n</blockquote>",
