I am just trying to accurately process what the existing UK-based 'PAS' system is doing - which is sharing encounter data designed to fit the NHS / HL7v2 description of an Admitting Doctor (Responsible HCP).  So in that (Health Admin / HL7v2) context, ADM in the FHIR encounter doesn't seem too wrong to me (though in a plain-english context, its plain wrong!).  I guess my use case is quite narrow at the moment - make Hospital IP / OP / ED data that would normally be HL7v2 appear appropriately in FHIR resources.
