This page: <a href=\"https://github.com/HL7-UK/System-Identifiers\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/HL7-UK/System-Identifiers\">https://github.com/HL7-UK/System-Identifiers</a> mentions some identifier systems which should be used. They seem to have been agreed, but are not yet included in the list of Known Identifier Systems: <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/identifier-registry.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/identifier-registry.html\">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/identifier-registry.html</a>. Is that in progress? If not, is there any consensus on how I can know for sure that I'm using the agreed system? I see the link to <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/registry/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/registry/\">http://hl7.org/fhir/registry/</a> but that doesn't seem to be live yet. I'll assume I can use them, but any thoughts much appreciated.</p>",

Any ideas how can I know if it's correct for STU3? I can't see anything on the GH page which indicates it only applies to DSTU2; am I looking in the wrong place? I speculatively tried <a href=\"https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/NamingSystem\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/NamingSystem\">https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/NamingSystem</a> but that doesn't resolve either.

It seems then that each project/profile defines this Identifier System themselves, and relies on people collaborating when producing the profiles to ensure the same value is used (e.g. in GPConnect too) rather than having a standard registry somewhere? In any case, I can continue. (PS also thanks for link to <a href=\"http://yellow.testlab.nhs.uk\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://yellow.testlab.nhs.uk\">yellow.testlab.nhs.uk</a>, that's a handy reference server.)</p>",
