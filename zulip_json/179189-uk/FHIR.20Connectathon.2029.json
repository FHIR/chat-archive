We're running an International Patient Access track at the FHIR Connectathon in January, and are interested in collecting information on all international FHIR implementations.</p>\n<p>At the connectathon, our main goal is to test as many client and server implementations as possible, against each other. We're interested in all country-specific server implementations, <strong>even if people running those servers would not be able to join the connectathon or the IPA track</strong> - as long as there is a test server or a sandbox environment publicly available.</p>\n<p>More info on the IPA track is in <a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2022-01+International+Patient+Access\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2022-01+International+Patient+Access</a>.</p>\n<p>Beyond the connectathon, we're also interested in listing information on country-specific FHIR implementations in the IPA Implementation Guide.</p>",
