Main difference is naming of identifiers - we're (plus HSCIC) using different URI's identifiers to describe the same set of values (NHS Number, Organisation Type, specialty/treatment function codes, etc. Are you planning to align with HSCIC when they publish them (or is the the other way around).  </p>",
