The first two (draft, active) are included in cited-artifact-status-type at <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/valueset-cited-artifact-status-type.html\">http://build.fhir.org/valueset-cited-artifact-status-type.html</a> and the \"retired\" publication-status could be represented with any of withdrawn, rejected, archived or retracted -- so there are more specific codes in cited-artifact-status-type so it seems incorrect to have a less specific code that overlaps with existing codes.  If really needed the binding is Extensible.   (Having said that, if you have a strong case to add the \"retired\" code to cited-artifact-status-type please let us know and we can still consider it.)   Not sure there is a strong case to add \"unknown\" for a status marker that is an optional element.  Seems like a must-have for publication-status because the element is required and cannot be left missing when unknown.</p>",
