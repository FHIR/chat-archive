There is some objection to calling them \"Preferred\" because that depends on your point of view (if you are querying a database, you might prefer a fully post-coordinated model, but if you are a clinician, you might prefer a precoordinated model because you only need to enter one code). One proposal is \"Normal analysis form\" or \"canonical\" similar words to indicate the analysis-friendly form. Any other opinions?</p>",
