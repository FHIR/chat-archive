While I didn't get to spend as much time in the gathering space as I'd like, the track was productive and it was great to catch up with some others in distant time zones.</p>\n<p>In fact, the Connectathon went so well that we feel we're in a good position to hand off SMARTv2 to the FHIR-I and Security WGs (e.g., the remaining open questions will need to be discussed in those groups regardless, and we have good direction for them).</p>\n<p>So with that in mind, thanks to everyone who has participated over the past year to move this spec forward.  We appreciate all of the time, effort, and expertise that has been brought to the project, as well as the communication with other humans during this crazy year =).  The calendar will be updated shortly.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>",
