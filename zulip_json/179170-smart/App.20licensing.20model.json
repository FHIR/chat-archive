So he need to identify which hospital uses his app. One way is to add hospital identification to each app installation. But that part is not specified in SMART.</p>",

This log could be recorded in a proprietary way, or could be a pattern using the FHIR AuditEvent resource.</p>",

For example, <a href=\"http://smarthealthit.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://smarthealthit.org\">smarthealthit.org</a> simply provide an app registry. The actual app still  runs on our web server. So after user is authorized through <a href=\"http://smarthealthit.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://smarthealthit.org\">smarthealthit.org</a> and starts the app, we have no idea who the user is. We have to either ask user login again through our authorization server, which is totally against the idea of \"single sign-on\", or setup a b2b authorization channel between these two authorization servers.</p>",
