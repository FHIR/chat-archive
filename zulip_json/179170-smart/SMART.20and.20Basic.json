The main difference is that there's no proposed binding to leverage - it's a wild west, and is intended to be.  So long as the Basic.code terminology is appropriately sized and clear, it's a reasonable basis for granting access and will hopefully be clear to patients.  One of the challenges is that stuff in Basic will typically be somewhat \"weird\" so coming up with a name that will be intuitive to both patients and clinicians is going to be tricky.</p>",

You can use existing confidentiality and sensitivity codes, but you can define your own. This is already a consistent security mechanism across all resources.

However this model requires active management of these clearance values on all data constantly, which is possible, but puts much of the management on the data. Note that this clearance model is what one commonly sees in TV-shows and movies depicting military 'special projects'. Thus all the data for special project - opossum is tagged with the opossum tag, and all users that are on the project are given the opossum clearance. It must be defined if owing the opossum tag gives only read access, CR, CRU, or all of CRUD. If differentiation is needed between for example Read access from CRUD access; then I guess two clearance are managed with the same tag. <br>\nI think this model is also commonly used in internet services like wiki, blog, and possibly in github. I say \"think\" as it appears to work this way, but I don't have insider knowledge.  Where the end users are managed by project leaders who can bring other users into their project, and by being in the project you go from just read access, to CRUD access.  Note that in an ABAC model the tags that go on the data are called... \"compartments\"....
