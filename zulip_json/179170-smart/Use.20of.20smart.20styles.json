In my experience, it's really hard to base the design of the  app on just the specified SMART styles. We'd really need a suite of test harnesses, or even screen shots, of EHR implementations, to take all of that into account when designing the UI and UX of the app.<br>\nSure, when you've built a few apps and integrated them to several EHR's, you get the full picture and are able to design your apps to better match the overall experience. But when you're just building your first app, there's currently very little visibility on how the app would actually behave within the EHR once integrated.<br>\nApp developers would really benefit from exposure on the EHR GUI's where the apps will be integrated in.</p>",
