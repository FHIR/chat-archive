Eventually when you issue an access token, your authorization server needs to associate that with the audience named in that first step -- we don't specify exactly how you need to do this or what you need to consider to be a match, it's just a security issue for you to be aware of, to make sure that you are using tokens intended for the API endpoints where they are used.</p>\n<p>If your authorization server only protects a single fhir server, this check might be unnecessary; but if you use a common authorization server with multiple different API servers, this is just a reminder that you need to make sure the access that was granted is valid at the API server where it is being used.
