What should we be returning in the profile claim? Should it be relative to the FHIR server root so the client can choose what FHIR version to use. E.g. \"profile\"=\"Patient/1234567890\". The relative URL is convenient as it can then be used directly to get content from other resources, e.g. /fhir/1.0/Observation?patient=Patient/1234567890.</p>",
