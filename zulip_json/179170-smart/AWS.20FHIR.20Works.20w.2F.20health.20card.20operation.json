I'm helping build out a FHIR API that can serve the health-cards-issue operation (POST /Patient/:id/$health-cards-issue). We're leveraging AWS' FHIR Works solution and I know we need to extend the base setup to include the health-cards-issue Operation. Anyone have any luck doing this? Or can point me in the right direction to start?</p>",

So could you share your experience with AFW and or other FHIR server implementations</p>",

But so far my team really like AWS' FHIR Works. It's slowly providing most of what we need (allowing for SMART Health cards). The Support engineers are pretty active and helpful as well. One thing we're still trying to work out is auth. We're currently using the default cognito, but do want to move into a SMART auth server approach</p>",
