I also downloaded the docker based version of the SMART dev sandbox and have it running on localhost:4000. When I bring up the SMART App launcher page, I am able to select a patient and provider. When I specify the launch URL to my local Growth Chart app (<a href=\"http://10.129.10.201:9000/launch.html\">http://10.129.10.201:9000/launch.html</a>), the simulated EHR screen shows up, the patient's name is displayed, however, the growth chart data is unavailable - \"10.129.10.201 sent an invalid response.\".  However, when I specify \"<a href=\"https://examples.smarthealthit.org/growth-chart-app/launch.html\">https://examples.smarthealthit.org/growth-chart-app/launch.html</a>\" in the launch URL, it works as expected. Please let me know how I can get this to work. Thank you.</p>",
