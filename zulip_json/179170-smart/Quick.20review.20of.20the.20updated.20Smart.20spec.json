It really improved.  <br>\nIt is also a lot longer which makes navigation a bit tricky.</p>\n<p>I've copied the specification in a word document and added my remarks as comments. Most of them are editorial, there are a couple that are more content related. I suggest that we discuss the document before we file Jira tickets. This will save everybody a lot of work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/10155/DjQNg7YNEiNDYex0DY5n06h2/SmartOnFhir-v2.docx\">SmartOnFhir-v2.docx</a></p>",
