CapabilitySet</li>\n<li>It cannot support the launch scope or launch-based capabilities (i.e. most Capabilities)</li>\n<li>But AWS can support the SMART on FHIR resource scopes (<code>patient/&lt;resourceType&gt;.read</code>) and identity scopes (<code>openid profile</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any help from the AWS folks or others on when these might be supported would be extremely helpful for our CARIN members.</p>",
