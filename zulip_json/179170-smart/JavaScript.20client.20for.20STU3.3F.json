In theory the existing FHIR.js (<a href=\"https://github.com/FHIR/fhir.js\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/FHIR/fhir.js\">https://github.com/FHIR/fhir.js</a>) library should basically work (agreed @<strong>nicola (RIO)</strong>?) unchanged, as should the SMART wrapper library. That said, there's at least one known issue (there's a hard-coded list of resources in SMART's wrapper that can auto-fill a \"patient\" parameter), and I'm sure there are more in practice.</p>",
