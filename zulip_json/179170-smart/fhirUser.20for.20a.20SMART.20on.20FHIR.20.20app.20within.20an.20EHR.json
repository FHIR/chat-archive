According to the documentation - \" To learn more about the user, the app should treat the fhirUser claim as the URL of a FHIR resource representing the current user. This will be a resource of type Patient, Practitioner, RelatedPerson, or Person\". Since the user is not a patient, should we set the fhirUser to the URL of the Practitioner associated with the user in a visit/encounter? Thanks.</p>",
