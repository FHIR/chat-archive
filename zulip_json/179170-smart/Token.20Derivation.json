My take on the requirements is that you need to pass to the AS<br>\n- the client id <br>\n- the scopes you are asking for </p>\n<p>and then you get back a token to pass to another client. Obviously, the token can't (well, shouldn't) have more scopes than you do, but you would (often should) ask for fewer scopes).</p>\n<p>Can we prototype a profile on the relevant rfc for this?</p>",
