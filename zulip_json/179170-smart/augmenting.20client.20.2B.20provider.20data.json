We can create a mapping of clients using the iss and users by requesting the profile / fhirid and are currently looking at storing this additional licensing and training information in an external data store.</p>\n<p>Just curious if anyone else has gone down this path and has any lessons learned / hints / warnings to share.</p>",

The latter has the advantages that it's in your control (many EHRs don't support most writes), and that you might share this kind of licensing or training-completion data across systems (e.g., if the same physician uses your app in different settings).</p>",
