Can access token be just opaque or does it need to be JWT (Json web token). If JWT, does it need to have any fields at minimum within the <em>access_token</em> field?  From this link as I hear (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK0AKB5PqGM&amp;ab_channel=JoshMandel\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK0AKB5PqGM&amp;ab_channel=JoshMandel</a>), there's no such concrete rule mandating access token format or the minimum set of fields to be part of access_token attribute itself. Is that a correct understanding?</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"ZK0AKB5PqGM\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK0AKB5PqGM&amp;ab_channel=JoshMandel\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZK0AKB5PqGM/default.jpg\"></a></div>",
