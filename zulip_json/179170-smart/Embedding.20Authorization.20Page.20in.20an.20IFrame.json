I see a guide on smarthealthit on how to embed the authorization page into a \"custom popup\", rather than using a new tab: <a href=\"http://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-js/targets.html\">http://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-js/targets.html</a>. </p>\n<p>Do we have any best practices or guidance on embedding authorization pages within a single page application? The user experience of a new tab opening can cause issues, but I realize that a new tab/window allows the user to ensure they are entering credentials into the correct location and helps protect against clickjacking. Is there a way to achieve a similar effect, in a secure way? The OAuth guidance I found states that a new tab/window is best practice.</p>",
