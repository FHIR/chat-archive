If so, could I connect and learn more about what you did, and how that went?</p>\n<p>Also, I was curious if the vision is to one day have a general \"App Store\" where anyone can grab a SMART on FHIR app, and use it in their health system. I see this gallery (<a href=\"https://apps.smarthealthit.org/apps/featured\">https://apps.smarthealthit.org/apps/featured</a>) but also see that there are multiple \"App Stores\" like Epic's App Orchard, Cerner's, etc. </p>\n<p>Just wanted to better understand real life examples and also thoughts on app stores / app ecosystems.</p>",
