In that same context, I have read what SMART is from their website but to be honest its not helpful for someone like me. I really want to understand how it works, and how can I implement it and in what way it helps. Can anyone here help me out, please?</p>",

My usual starting point for drilling into a new FHIR-related technology is to do a web search for \"FHIR DevDays Videos\", possibly qualified by the technology of interest.  They're relatively short and a good way to dive in.  Then I read through the spec and play with the public sand boxes.  If I have more questions after that, I find the stream here that deals with that particular technology (or ask on #implementers if it's not obvious) and first search for answers and, if I don't find any, ask the question.</p>",
