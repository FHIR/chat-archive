I want to be able to make calls to rest endpoints in my backend service from the provider facing SMART app launched by the EMR. If the provider is authenticated by the EMR then  I wouldn't want them to login again into the backend service of my SMART app for my usecase. I was wondering if there are other folks who have thought about this and can advise on designing this authorization flow. It would super helpful to see any example app which such design.</p>",
