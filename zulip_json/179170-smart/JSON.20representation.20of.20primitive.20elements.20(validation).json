The MedicationRequest resources we're trying to add as an entry are leveraging the concept of prepending an underscore to the \"intent\" element name because there's no data to populate from the backend. The open hapi FHIR server validates the \"_intent\" field with an extension but neither SOF fhirclient nor fhir.resources will validate \"_intent\". Has anyone else experienced this issue or have a suggestion?</p>",

( I tried and failed with my my intermediate python skills to create a PR to fix.)  If I need a primitive extension I am left with no other option but convert to a dict at that point. :-(</p>",
