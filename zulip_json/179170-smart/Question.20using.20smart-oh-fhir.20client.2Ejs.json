We rolled our own client because we had need for multi-token OAuth support (among other things).  </p>\n<p>That being said, we've been careful to make our implementation modular, so we can swap out the underlying interop library.  Our implementation uses a somewhat esoteric package management system and hand-rolled schemas that are difficult to maintain, so I've been keeping an eye out for something on NPM that uses the published JsonSchemas.   </p>\n<p>Currently I'm tracking three javascript client libraries besides our own...  <code>fhir/fhir.js</code>, <code>smart-on-fhir/client.js</code>, and <code>vermonster/fhir-kit-client</code>.  And, as you can see from the <a href=\"https://github.com/clinical-meteor/software-development-kit/tree/master/utilities\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/clinical-meteor/software-development-kit/tree/master/utilities\">utilities page</a> of our SDK, we've begun the process of bringing them into the Clinical Meteor project.   I've also created a <a href=\"https://github.com/clinical-meteor/meteor-on-fhir/pull/47\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/clinical-meteor/meteor-on-fhir/pull/47\">pull request</a> to track the evaluation and integration of these libraries into our the open-source Meteor on FHIR project.  (Actually, now that I'm looking at NPM, there may be two or three new ones I need to look into also.</p>\n<p>Best I can say right now is that I'm hoping to get reference implementations of all three client libraries by the Montreal Working Group.  Or maybe it will wind up on the list of things to be done _at_ the Working Group.</p>",
