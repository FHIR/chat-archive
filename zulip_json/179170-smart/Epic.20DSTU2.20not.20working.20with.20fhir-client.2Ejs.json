I am using the non-production clientId, and have everything set appropriately (as far as I can tell). After doing some debugging, I noticed that the FHIR client is trying to call this URL: <a href=\"https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/api/FHIR/DSTU2/.well-known/smart-configuration\">https://fhir.epic.com/interconnect-fhir-oauth/api/FHIR/DSTU2/.well-known/smart-configuration</a> and it is returning a 404, and thus preventing me from being able to authenticate. Anyone know what the deal is with this or who I can contact to get some assistance?</p>",
