Some questions here:</p>\n<p>1) If the url is not a FHIR endpoint, for example, it is a pdf or png file, I don't think SMART has scope to request/grant. So  normally, how does EHR grant a client to access attachments of DocumentReference and DiagnosticReport?</p>\n<p>2) If the url is a FHIR endpoint, we know Binary could be used. What other resources could be used as attachment of DocumentReference and DiagnosticReport?</p>\n<p>3) Because we want to verify the existence of attachment, not the content of the attachment, we are considering HEAD request as specified in FHIR <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/http.html#head\">HTTP page</a> instead of using GET to download files. Does a client need access token to do HEAD request? If so, should client request using same 'read' scope?</p>",
