If the app requires a patient context, is the expectation that the app calls the \"authorize\" endpoint (assuming we are going with Authorization Code grant type in the oAuth flow) with launch/patient scope and the authorization server displays the patient lookup screen after provider authentication? My other question is - how will the \"authorize\" endpoint know if a provider or patient login screen be displayed for authentication. In the SMART App Launcher test page, I saw that \"login_type=provider\" or \"login_type=patient\" is being used.  Thank you.</p>",

Handling this is part of the job of the \"authorize\" endpoint (i.e., knowing how to authenticate users, and knowing which users are allowed to access which records).</p>",
