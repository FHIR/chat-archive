I've been fighting with oauth2 for a couple of weeks. I believe my app is a good candidate for a back end service. Do I get to call that or do I need some kind of special approval to implement that way. The documentation says testing back end in the sandbox allows you to authenticate and get an access token at the same time. I can't get that to work. I will try emailing those guys again.</p>",
