Specifically, the links <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/restful-security-service\">http://hl7.org/fhir/restful-security-service</a> and <a href=\"http://fhir-registry.smarthealthit.org/StructureDefinition/oauth-uris\">http://fhir-registry.smarthealthit.org/StructureDefinition/oauth-uris</a> generate 404s. You can see where these links are provided in the spec here: <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/1.0.0/conformance/index.html#example\">http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/1.0.0/conformance/index.html#example</a></p>\n<p>I recognize that there is a v2 of the spec now, but many servers in the US are likely still using v1. Particularly of note, the CMS Interoperability requirement requires use of the SMART on FHIR v1 (at a minimum) for US insurers who offer government sponsored health plans. Is there any way we can get these links back to working order?</p>",

That led us to test that link and the other one and found the 404s. I can follow up with Touchstone folks if this just needs to be fixed in their test scripts.</p>",

That sounds like a good place to start. <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/restful-security-service\">http://hl7.org/fhir/restful-security-service</a> notably is not something defined or required by SMART (v1 or v2), though it does appear in an example CapabilityStatement from the v1 spec. <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/valueset-restful-security-service.html\">http://build.fhir.org/valueset-restful-security-service.html</a> has the current ValueSet for <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.security.service\">http://build.fhir.org/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.security.service</a> (you'll notice the <code>system</code> has migrated to <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/restful-security-service\">http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/restful-security-service</a>) -- but again, populating this field is not required by SMART.</p>",
