Also, the Angular framework (on which we are basing our SMART app) has deprecated support for IE 11 and it will removed in the next version.  Microsoft 365 apps are <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666\">dropping support</a> for IE 11 in August.  That in itself is not a problem for SMART, but I think the number of development frameworks that support IE 11 will rapidly dwindle if not even Microsoft supports it.</p>\n<p>I am wondering what the expected timeframe is for EHR vendors to update their embedded browser component from IE 11 to Edge.</p>",
