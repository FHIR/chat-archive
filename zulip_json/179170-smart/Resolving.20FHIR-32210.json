I'm sure there are things we can do to improve clarity, but I'm also wary of committing to re-organizing the body of the spec without a very clear understanding of what it'd look like and what the advantages would be. Are there folks here who can speak in favor of these changes, or in favor of the status quo?</p>",

In IHE the technical specifications are always described as interactions, with each interaction described in terms of (a) trigger events, (b) message encoding, and (c) expected actions. These (a+b+c) patterns are repeated as much as possible.  Where each interaction is described in UML interaction diagramming. Typically the (c) from one interaction causes the (a) of the next; but it is flexible to enable the first interaction to potentially cause multiple things, or have alternative interactions based on (c).</p>",
