This parameter prevents leaking a genuine bearer token to a counterfeit resource server. (Note: in the case of an EHR launch flow, this aud value is the same as the launch's iss value.)</a></p>\n<p>Then in the example it appears that the aud param should be the url up to and including everything you would need to construct a valid query url when given a relative url. By this I mean <a href=\"https://fhir.server.com/R4\">https://fhir.server.com/R4</a> (use an R4 server as an example).</p>\n<p>So my question is should the aud param url be  <a href=\"https://fhir.server.com/R4\">https://fhir.server.com/R4</a> or  <a href=\"https://fhir.server.com\">https://fhir.server.com</a> ?</p>",

        "content": "<p>The <code>aud</code> parameter should be a valid FHIR server base URL. In other words, calling <code>${aud}/metadata</code> should return metadata for the server. FHIR imposes no rules on what a base URL needs to look like. So either of the examples you wrote <em>could</em> work, depending on the actual behavior. To give a specific example: <code>http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4</code> is a valid base and <code>http://hapi.fhir.org</code> is not, because the latter... isn't a FHIR server base URL.</p>",
