I have done a POC with HAPI, Firely, and Microsoft FHIR Server.  I am now at the authentication research phase.  I was wondering for an open source scenario what would people recommend if I need to support SMART authentication?  I know there is HAPI and I've heard about using KeyClock.  But does anyone have any recommendations, github repos, or blog posts they would recommend?  Thank you very much.</p>",

So understood on using IdentityServer for the Identity Provider.   follow up, what technology are you using for the FHIR Server?  HAPI?  or Microsoft FHIR Server?</p>",
