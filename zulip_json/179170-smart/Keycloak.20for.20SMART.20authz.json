That was my point, that if the resource server is  getting a request for patient/Immunization.read, but the scope being presented is patient/*.read, should it be the responsibility of the resource server to interpret the wildcard and allow/deny the request.</p>\n<p>In my architecture we have an API gateway layer on top of the resource server. The API gateway layer protects the APIs by applying security policies like OpenID token enforcement etc. </p>\n<p>Outside of SMART on FHIR, we haven't encountered the wildcard scopes, so the policy enforcement for scopes is verbatim.  The list of scopes can be configured for each API or a resource  endpoint when applying a policy.</p>\n<p>e.g. API security policy for /Immunization resource can be configured with scopes like <code>openid fhirUser patient/Immunization.read </code><br>\nWith this configuration when a SMART app tries to access the resource, it must present a token which proves that it has been granted access to these scopes. </p>\n<p>Since this validation/comparison of scopes at API policy level doesn't take into account wildcards, an app with these scopes <code>openid fhirUser patient/*.read</code> can't get past the security policy layer as the patient/*.read doesn't translate to patient/Immunization.read. </p>\n<p>I was wondering whether authorization server should interpret the wildcard scopes and translate/return the appropriate scopes accordingly.</p>",

AFAICT, this just prevents someone who snooped on the authorization code and was able to exchange for an access token from renewing it.  Is that correct, or am I missing something else?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, my local recording did work.  It's via Jitsi, so your recording is likely better quality if it worked, but all the text appears readable and the audio came through clearly.

I'll let you know if I have issues though.</p>\n<p>I appreciate the follow-up on the PKCE topic as well- I think your understanding there is accurate, in that both PKCE and confidential clients give us some confidence that the tokens actually wound up in the right hands (with confidential still being more secure if it's possible to be used).</p>\n<p>So it has been Okta's stance that given the sensitivity of the refresh token that it's not something we're minting without the client falling into one of those 2 buckets (confidential, or public w/ PKCE).  </p>\n<p>Part of my proxy architecture would allow me to bypass that requirement if needed, and it would do so by having the /token proxy performing client authentication on behalf of the public client that doesn't use PKCE (Okta wouldn't know it as a public client- it would know it as a confidential one).</p>",

Exactly how that is determined is left to the implementation.<br>\nIn my particular implementation, since I'm using signed JWTs for my access tokens, I am also including the selected patient id as a claim within the access token, so it will be easy for the resource server to determine what patient the token is scoped to during the introspection process.<br>\nFor the intent response in particular, seems like it can be anything you want, and so I'd think to derive any value from that at all, the organization hosting the resource and authorization server would need to publish what their authorization server might send for it, so application developers can account for it in their applications.</p>",

I found out on Friday that my recording only has my audio in it (so the conversations are very one sided- ha).  So if Gino's recording is better, I'm hoping we can use his, otherwise mine is better than nothing and I'll share it!</p>",

Thank you for your message and responses</p>\n<p>The question on device flow - I was interested in device flow as there mayn't be an option to key in login information. For example a patient may be equipped with a IoT device (a glucometer) and sync with patient's mobile app. The glucometer may have to post Observations at frequent time intervals to the app. How would the device authenticate with the patient app ? Or would that be M2M ? I am not an expert of M2M. So if you can offer some insights that would be of help</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"251824\">@Venu Gopal</span>,</p>\n<p>I see- so the device code flow is great in use cases where a headless device (or at least input limited device), has the ability to directly communicate with an API from your service. One of the best examples of this would be a smart TV- authenticating with your streaming service in a user friendly way by allowing the user to perform the actual login with a computer/mobile device rather than typing with their TV remote on a virtual keyboard. At the end of the device code flow process, the IoT device actually has OAuth tokens in hand that it can use for subsequent authorization directly to an API.</p>\n<p>A few considerations on that though:<br>\n1- For device code flow, the device does at least need to display a code to the user- perhaps 8 characters or so.  Will your device have any display at all? Even an old LCD panel like you might find on a 30 year old wrist watch will do- but it does require something.</p>\n<p>2- Also in device code flow, the device does need to communicate directly with the authorization service to obtain tokens and make API calls.</p>\n<p>I haven't designed a system like this personally, so please just take this as initial thoughts- but I think you should first start with who the actual OAuth2 client is (who/what is actually calling the FHIR API).  From your description, it sounds to me like perhaps your mobile app is the actual OAuth2 client to the FHIR API, and so the mobile app is the one that would do the SMART flow.</p>",
