With the current CRD specifications the prior auth determination should be populated within a card. However, CDS cards are not always order specific and are not intended to persist. Therefore, has there been any thought of populating the prior auth determination in a system action so it can be automatically populated on an order and persisted on an order?</p>\n<p>We would still think options such as a link to a SMART on FHIR app should be in a CDS card.</p>",

For example, a card that simply says \"No prior authorization needed\" when there are three orders in development isn't that helpful because it's not clear whether the statement applies to all the orders or a single order (and if only one, which one).  The next release will also include an expectation that implementers support a card action which updates an order to add a note about prior authorization (e.g. an assertion that none is needed, a prior authorization number if one was pre-emptively provided, etc.) so that information returned that should be persisted with an order will be.</p>",
