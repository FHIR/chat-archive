However looking though the spec I'm struggling to see where this is defined.</p>\n<p>There's some related language in<br>\n<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-crd/hooks.html#configuration-options-extension\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-crd/hooks.html#configuration-options-extension</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-crd/hooks.html#annotate\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-crd/hooks.html#annotate</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-crd/hooks.html#pre-emptive-prior-authorization\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-crd/hooks.html#pre-emptive-prior-authorization</a><br>\nbut nothing definitive.</p>\n<p>Also some related tickets:<br>\n<a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-33225\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-33225</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-34216\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-34216</a></p>\n<p>Are we currently in a state where provider and payer need to mutually define an extension, and if that goes well then it will later become a defined \"SHALL\" in the spec?<br>\nThanks</p>",
