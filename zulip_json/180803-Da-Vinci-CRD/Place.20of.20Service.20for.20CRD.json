We are planning to use the Location.type data element for Place of Service, however the binding currently is extensible but bound to (<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/v3/ServiceDeliveryLocationRoleType/vs.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/v3/ServiceDeliveryLocationRoleType/vs.html\">http://build.fhir.org/v3/ServiceDeliveryLocationRoleType/vs.html</a>). Should we map the CMS Place of Codes with the LocationRoleType codes ? Or is there a different data element that should be used to send this detail ?</p>",
