Do you have an example or code snippet where the output of <code>org = Organization.construct()...</code> in your example exports to a resource in JSON?  That would be example 5 in <a href=\"https://github.com/nazrulworld/fhir.resources\">https://github.com/nazrulworld/fhir.resources</a>.  <br>\nReason is that when I try to use json.dumps() to convert a class to a JSON string, I get an error: <code>TypeError: Object of type Organization is not JSON serializable</code></p>\n<p>BTW, great job on this python module!  I really like using it for extracting elements from FHIR instances. Thanks! :-) </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"197422\">Md Nazrul Islam</span> <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179218-python/topic/Data.20Export.20in.20FHIR.20format/near/222090793\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/fhir.resources/\">https://pypi.org/project/fhir.resources/</a> yes I think FHIR server is not relevant here,  you can construct each resource from your backend and if need export as JSON (it's easy)</p>\n</blockquote>",
