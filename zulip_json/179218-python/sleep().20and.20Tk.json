Structure is akin to the following pseudocode:</p>\n<p>ws = Tk()<br>\nWhile True:<br>\n      window.delete current rows<br>\n      use FHIR to get hold of new list of resource data, multiple rows<br>\n     window.insert new rows<br>\n     ws.update()<br>\n     sleep(30)</p>\n<p>..which works fine. On windows (not on Linux) the window quite often states (Not responding) in its title, which is probably caused by sleep(30) (?!). Polling every 30 secs makes sense in this context. Is this behavior caused by sleep() and if so, how to circumvent the issue ?</p>",
