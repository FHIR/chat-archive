There is no python FHIR client that supports asyncio yet. We are working right now on it. We use it in a closed source project, but it will be open-sourced soon.<br>\n2. Current implementation materializes each FHIR resources as classes. It uses code generations to be up to date. So instead of developing a python library for FHIR, you have to develop a code generator tool instead.<br>\nWe decided that FHIR library should work with dictionaries rather than with classes. We are using JSON schemas to validate FHIR resources. So to add support for new an FHIR release you don't need to regenerate a library source code, you just need to add JSON schema for a new FHIR release. Asyncio adapter is in on the way.</p>\n<p>If you find these ideas reasonable, contributions are welcome.</p>",

We use their schemas for validation. You can find a list of supported versions here <a href=\"https://github.com/beda-software/fhir-py/tree/master/fhirpy/schemas\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/beda-software/fhir-py/tree/master/fhirpy/schemas\">https://github.com/beda-software/fhir-py/tree/master/fhirpy/schemas</a>.
