Regardless, a value for this attribute should be accepted.<br>\nIs this a bug?<br>\nHere's the code snippet:<br>\n<code>import fhirclient.models.procedure as proc\nprocedure = proc.Procedure.read('SMART-Procedure-2', smart.server)\n</code><br>\n...and the following is a snippet of what's in the FHIR instance I'm trying to read...<br>\n<code>  \"meta\": {\n    \"versionId\": \"2\",\n    \"lastUpdated\": \"2020-06-09T01:32:45.000+00:00\",\n    \"source\": \"#xJ1vrEIvhALyICHv\"\n  }</code></p>",
