I'd really like to roundtrip and create a model instance after that, but it complains:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>WARNING:root:_searchRevInclude:\n  name &#39;self&#39; is not defined\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>and strips it out.   Is there a temporary solution to adding in  \"_[primitive-element]\" and still use the model.   I use the class and dot notation after this step and don't want to have to rewrite it all as dict.</p>",
