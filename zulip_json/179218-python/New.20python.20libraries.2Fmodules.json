I've been away from that for a while and now I'm getting back into the game and notice there are few other players on the field. I now see the beda software fhir-py, and also the fhir.resources module. Has a favorite emerged? What's your opinion of these? Is smart-on-fhir client-py still being developed? The last commit was 4 months ago, and the current models support R4, so it not exactly dead.  Just wondering if I should switch?</p>",

Importantly for me it supports FHIR primitives , YAML out of the box and has a sweet factory method <code>construct_fhir_element</code> </p>\n<p>IMO to gotchas are :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An open issue on having to scrub None-like objects  [] and {} when serializing </li>\n<li>Using datetime library instead of a fhirDate - but this turns out to work better and more 'pythonic' IMO</li>\n<li>integration with fast API   as mentioned above</li>\n</ul>",
