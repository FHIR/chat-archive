Our client wants a product where the storing and sharing of health care data is central. The team is proficient in Django and there is already a prototype frontend in Angular, so I'm thinking of using Django REST Framework as middleware API. I've done some research the last weeks, here and there, but I still have some trouble getting my head around some concepts. Mainly: What is a 'FHIR server', what does it offer?</p>\n<p>I've seen a few video's today like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbQcJj1GqH0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbQcJj1GqH0</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBAhIoArh80\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBAhIoArh80</a> which were helpful. I'm grasping the resource/data model part I think.</p>\n<p>So the stack I'm thinking of is something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Angular</li>\n<li>Django REST + FHIR-py (<a href=\"https://github.com/beda-software/fhir-py\">https://github.com/beda-software/fhir-py</a>)</li>\n<li>PostgreSQL database</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And somewhere in between a FHIR server (right?):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://hapifhir.io/\">https://hapifhir.io/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-api-for-fhir\">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-api-for-fhir</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/healthcare\">https://cloud.google.com/healthcare</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.health-samurai.io/aidbox\">https://www.health-samurai.io/aidbox</a> // <a href=\"https://fhirbase.aidbox.app/\">https://fhirbase.aidbox.app/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Preferably I'll have something I can run on our own data centers, so something open-source. But yeah, first need the get the concept.</p>",

But I know some guys from Germany who successfully use the sync version of fhir-py with Django.</p>\n<p>There are frontend tools from <a href=\"http://beda.software\">beda.software</a> but we more focused on React. <br>\nIf you need some help on the frontend please join <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"179169\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/179169-javascript\">#javascript</a> stream. We are discussing TypeScript annotations for FHIR right now that may be helpful for your Angular frontend.</p>\n<p>FHIR server provides you with FHIR API  that allows you to interact with resources from the healthcare domain.<br>\nEverything that out of healthcare scope you have to implement on your own. So when you start choosing across FHIR servers you should pain your attention on how you can extend it.<br>\nPersonally, I prefer aidbox from all other solutions.</p>",
