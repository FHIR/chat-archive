Essentially there are three questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Has the technology represented in the spec been implemented and do we have some sense it works</li>\n<li>Is the specification sufficiently clear that independent implementers can pick it up, write code, and successfully interoperate?</li>\n<li>Is there a set of folks who care about this IG enough that they're willing to write code to test it?  (because if not, why are we bringing it to ballot?)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You're probably fine wrt the first in terms of past experience with other implementations.  The real question is the second.  If the IG is largely copy &amp; paste from US core with a few minor changes, you're probably fine.  If there's any significant variation that might bring into question how implementable/well-written the spec is, then the FMG would have grounds for seeking a connectathon first or seeking justification on why there was urgency to go to ballot before there was implementation experience with this particular spec.</p>\n<p>I'm assuming that for #3, you have sufficient evidence of intention to implement that the lack of a connectathon before start of ballot wouldn't be a barrier.</p>\n<p>In short: certainly wouldn't reject it out-of-hand, but might have some questions and need some justification.</p>",

And that will lead into problems later on.</p>\n<p>Having a specification with a higher status would be an important signal for the implementers here that this is something that is worth adopting, and help them commit to following the international specification.</p>\n<p>I'm sure we can find people to write code to test the specification, from the local community. But the governmental organization actually responsible for implementing the patient access API for the national healthcare IT infrastructure have indicated they'd need more than just a draft of a spec in order to commit to adopting it.</p>",
