As far as I remember the outcome was that support for response Bundles is implied, as you can search.</p>\n<p>How do we feel about the Composition resource? Given that we have <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/ccda-on-fhir/index.html\">http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/ccda-on-fhir/index.html</a>, it could be nice to support it. I see many areas benefiting from such an approach.</p>\n<p>However, I'm not really pushing for it to be included in the base version of the IPA. We could also have a \"CDA\" profile building on top of IPA, and requiring support for the ccda-on-fhir IG.</p>",
