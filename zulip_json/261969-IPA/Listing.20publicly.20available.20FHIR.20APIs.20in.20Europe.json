There are several sources on FHIR Servers, from the official HL7 website to more practical “how-to” guides, which can prove to be a useful resource on their relevance for hospitals. Any hospital offering HL7 FHIR APIs through a FHIR Server will be able to “self-declare” their server to HL7 Europe, via an online submission form, wherein they can indicate where and how the FHIR server metadata information can be accessed, status (production, test, or demonstration), and what services are offered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191415\">@Giorgio Cangioli</span> do you have an idea on where we can track the progress?</p>",
