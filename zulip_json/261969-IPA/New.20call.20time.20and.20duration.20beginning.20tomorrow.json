The IPS call will be immediately following the IPA call at 11:00 AM EDT, also for 60 min.  I've made these adjustments on the HL7 Conference Call Center <a href=\"http://www.hl7.org/concalls/CallDetails.cfm?concall=56760\">calendar</a>.  Since I did made these changes today the automatic reminder that was sent was for the previous combined call (beginning at 10:30), but future reminders will be sent correctly starting next week.</p>",
