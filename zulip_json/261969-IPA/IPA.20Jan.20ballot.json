I am leaving on a vacation this evening, so I leave it up to Floyd on how he wants to handle this.</p>\n<p>As an aside, I don't think it is appropriate for a non-co-chair to create agenda pages for WG calls.

You indicated the WG but did not assign the ticket to anyone so Jira did not notify anyone in CGP to look at it and NO ONE in all of our meetings indicated there was such a task. So if you didn't specifically email a co-chair or assign the ticket to one of us and no one indicated a task during any of our calls, how were we to know about the task?  We have a significant failure of process here and I am concerned you indicate a failure of action on CGP's part. I do not accept that assumption.  I agree with Jean that we can send an email and request and e-vote - we do need to give the WG time to review.   So are we just approving the PSS? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191410\">@Brett Marquard</span> I don't doubt the team has been working but we had no information about it.</p>",
