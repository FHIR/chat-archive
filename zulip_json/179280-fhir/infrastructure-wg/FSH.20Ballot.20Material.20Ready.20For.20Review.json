The vote for going to ballot is scheduled on 3/30.  What's up there now should be close to the final product, but suggestions are welcome. For one thing, we are only officially voting on the Language Reference portion, and there is a lot of informative material. Suggestions on how to communicate this to voters would be appreciated.</p>",
