The security label can be applied to the elementsâ€™ layer rather than resources.<br>\nFor example, the consent of the owner of the health information only applies to the part of the CONDITION resource instead of the entire resource.<br>\n2.  A separate triage tag can be specified out of the meta.tags for priority and time sensitivity of patient safety resource information. This triage tag can enable the system to push the information to the registered endpoints instead of waiting for the pull.<br>\n3.  A guideline should provide suggestions on the number of reference layers to leverage smooth message exchanges without triggering a storm.</p>",
