So although IHE welcomes double visibility, it is overhead that is hard to keep consistent.<br>\nThe question is if we think there will be a need for the confluence method, or if everyone can get into the registry easily enough? Right now getting into the registry is not as easy as editing a confluence page. I think it should be considered far better to make the registry singularly the place.</p>",
