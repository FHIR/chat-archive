Question: I have a list of Jira issues and their resolutions that I posted to the <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179229-subscriptions/topic/R5.20Feedback\">Subscriptions</a> stream.  Since the changes have all been merged in and nobody had any other feedback, I assume the next step is to mark the issues as 'applied', which I cannot do.  Is there a process for requesting that, or is this message as much 'process' as exists for this?  Thanks!</p>",
