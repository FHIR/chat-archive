Presumably that may be because it's a code datatype and required binding, but maybe it would make more sense for the value set to be owned by Vocab?  Or, if not, then we have a proposal for updating the value set definition based on the final conclusions reached yesterday for updating ConceptMap overall, as the culmination of a significant review that we've undertaken over several cycles.</p>",
