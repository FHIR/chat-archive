But I think it's not as simple as multiple specimens - I think OO should define a SpecimenGroup resource, and add it as a choice to the specimen reference - this is backwards compatible and solves the problem, and also allows for grouping semantics, since in most cases, the multiple specimens are grouped in some way (shared container, or shared identifier, or shared handling)</p>",
