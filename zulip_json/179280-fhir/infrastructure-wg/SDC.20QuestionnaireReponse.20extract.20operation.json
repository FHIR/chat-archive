Is this supposed to be based on Questionnaire or QuestionnaireResponse for doing the extraction?  I see the Response can be passed as an optional parameter.  It appears this is an artifact from an older version that was Questionnaire extract, but I wanted to verify if this the intended case or not.</p>\n<p>If it is meant to be Questionnaire, is there supposed to be validation of the questionnaire field in the response if it's set to make sure it matches what is given if it's Questionnaire/[id]/$extract?</p>\n<p>Thanks!SDC QuestionnaireReponse extract operation</p>",
