Would you attend? The other option  is to wait until we have a mock-up how FSH would look for a small-ish IG. That might be more digestable.

I assume you might not end up with exactly the same FSH file after a round trip? But you would always end up with the same StructureDefinition after a round trip? Maybe some words can be added on this in the Wiki.</li>\n<li>Is a FSH Tank roughly the FSH content + configuration file of one IG/Package / Simplifier project?</li>\n</ul>",

It doesn't look like I can add you. </li>\n<li>We are playing with names and bad puns, hence the inconsistency between Sashimi and Hatchery.  I think Hatchery is more descriptive: Hatchery -&gt; FSH -&gt; Sushi -&gt; StructureDef.  We've called our \"smart slicing\" algorithm \"Ginzu\" (get it?)...</li>\n<li>Regarding round trips, we have introduced an escape syntax that in theory should allow round tripping from any SD. Anything that we can't render in \"core FSH\" could be addressed in the escape syntax. If you take a \"wild-type\" SD and run Hatchery, you should get FSH that subsequently can be round-tripped without further changes. In other words, FSH -&gt; SD -&gt; FSH should preserve the structure of FSH.</li>\n<li>FSH Tank  is exactly as you describe... FSH content plus configuration that can produce an IG, and the content of one repository. I think it equates to a FHIR package (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191469\">@Chris Moesel</span> can correct me if I'm wrong).</li>\n<li>FSH Farm is a collection of FSH Tanks.  <span aria-label=\"grinning\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f600\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning\">:grinning:</span></li>\n</ul>",

For example, it's pretty prominent in the description of strengths (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>required</strong>: To be conformant, the concept in this element SHALL be <em>from the specified value set</em>.<br>\n<strong>extensible</strong>: To be conformant, the concept in this element SHALL be <em>from the specified value set</em> if any of the codes within the value set can apply to the concept being communicated. If the value set does not cover the concept (based on human review), alternate codings (or, data type allowing, text) may be included instead.<br>\n<strong>preferred</strong>: Instances are encouraged to draw <em>from the specified codes</em> for interoperability purposes but are not required to do so to be considered conformant.<br>\n<strong>example</strong>: Instances are not expected or even encouraged to draw <em>from the specified value set</em>. The value set merely provides examples of the types of concepts intended to be included.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, there are also references to <code>binding</code> all over the place -- so it really is a question of what Shorthand users would prefer and/or find most natural.</p>",
