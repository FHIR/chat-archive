For anyone not following closely, there are now to additional resources in R4B: <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/branches/R4B/subscriptiontopic.html\">SubscriptionTopic</a> and <a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/branches/R4B/subscriptionstatus.html\">SubscriptionStatus</a>.  With the new resources, the <a href=\"https://argonautproject.github.io/subscription-backport-ig/\">Backport IG</a> (note: currently on <a href=\"http://github.io\">github.io</a>, because of build dependencies) has been refactored quite a bit - e.g., many things that were in the IG are now in the core spec.</p>\n<p>Other recent changes of note are the resolutions to some long-open questions, specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SubscriptionTopic has a way to use event triggers (in addition to the previous resource-based triggers)</li>\n<li>SubscriptionTopic includes a <code>notificationShape</code> backbone element, which describes related resources that MAY be included with notifications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We'll be focusing on this at the Connectathon, but I know that many people interested in this are committed to other tracks.  Cheers!</p>",
