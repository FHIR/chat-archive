If we're copying the CDA thing, what I would do is add \"url\" to the types for the originalText extension (<a href=\"http://build.fhir.org/extension-originaltext.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://build.fhir.org/extension-originaltext.html\">http://build.fhir.org/extension-originaltext.html</a>) - it explicitly says that it's the same thing as CDA. But if w're asserting a more general 'this is the narrative for this object' without claiming that the object is derived from the text... then that's a different extension. The language associated with the task and the discussion have been indecisive on this... <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191407\">@Rick Geimer</span></p>",
