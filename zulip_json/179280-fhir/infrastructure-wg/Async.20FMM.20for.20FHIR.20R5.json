Now, with respect to use in Bulk Data operations, it makes sense to call this FMM4. But we don't have experience working with this async pattern for arbitrary FHIR interactions, and I think we probably will want more/different techniques in that context ... because if we're going to call it FMM4, we should try to apply that maturity level to custom operations like $export where we actually have experience with it, and not for interactions like FHIR CRUD (see <a href=\"#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/Async.20use.20cases.3A.20delay.20vs.20data.20deluge/near/249984936\">discussion</a>).</p>",
