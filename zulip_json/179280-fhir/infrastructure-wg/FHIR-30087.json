One such comparison can be found (Todo: bring this into the build) between DAF  and QICore . Note that this comparison is generated by tooling under ongoing development, and is purely draft content to demonstrate the idea of profile comparison.\"<br>\nQ1: The resolution is \"Will fix\". My understanding from the ticket is that the \"real\" resolution is \"will remove _(Todo: bring this into the build)_ from the sentence\". Is that correct? Or the resolution is actually \"bring this into the build\"?<br>\nQ2: As my understanding, DAF is replaced by SDC. Should \"DAF and QICore\" be changed to \"SDC and QICore\"?<br>\nQ3: \"One such comparison can be found between DAF and QICore\" Where can I find such comparison?</p>",

        "content": "<p>Yeah, that's a little sparse for a resolution.  We should drop the reference to DAF, given that it's retired.  I think the correct solution is to grab one of the comparison pages between a couple of US Core profiles - ideally one that shows a few interesting differences.  I think the original text envisioned actually copying the 'compare' page into the spec, but I'm not sure we need to do that so long as we're pointing to frozen releases of the US Core spec.</p>",
