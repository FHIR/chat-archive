But in terms of finalizing the deliverable, we need to retain a persistent, professional document that can both be shared with the community, delivered to ONC as a completed deliverable, and retained on file so it can be available for future US Government audits.  As such, it needs to be formatted with author, dates, background, etc. so the document can stand on its own.  We proposed the HL7 white paper template, because that was created especially for documents of this sort, and addresses what we need.</p>\n<p>I personally don’t care whether we publish officially as a white paper or not, but that’s the only mechanism I know of under the HL7 process.   But we do need to send a finished, polished, approved copy to ONC, share it with the FHIR community, and reserve a copy to support audits so need to polish it up so it looks like a completed deliverable rather than work in progress.  </p>\n<p>Wayne</p>",
