(the upper cardinality change on this has also been approved in another tracker also)<br>\nAs that change had nothing to do with the original request of the tracker, PA would like someone to create a new issue specifically for this issue, along with the reasoning/use cases on having no connection type value, and what that would mean.<br>\n(these notes are also in the tracker above which is marked as duplicate)</p>",
