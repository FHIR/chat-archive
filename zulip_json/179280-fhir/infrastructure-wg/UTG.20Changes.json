As far as I can see, only <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-19977\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-19977</a> and <a href=\"https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-20698\">https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-20698</a> would need to be applied in UTG. Because the process is rather time-consuming (especially finding UTG voters), I would propose to do this in a single batch. Maybe someone can double check if I've missed any ticket? Happy to do the changes for the ValueSets and CodeSystems, but I would appreciate any support for getting it through the whole process.</p>",
