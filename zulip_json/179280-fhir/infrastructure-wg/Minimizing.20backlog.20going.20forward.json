I think the main reason for the backlog is that no-one is on the hook to 'apply' a change once it's agreed - and we don't even necessarily think about the 'size' of the work involved in applying a change.  I'm wondering if it might make sense for us to establish a rule that we don't agree to make a change without identifying someone who agrees to make the change - and assigning it to them as soon as the resolution is stored.  We can then check the backlog each call, or even each month, of \"assigned but not yet committed\" issues that are older than, say, 4 weeks and figure out whether we need to re-jig who's responsible.</p>\n<p>Does that seem workable?  Obviously it doesn't make the current backlog disappear, but it might help with ensuring it doesn't get so big in the future.</p>",

It is not a problem for tickets that get 'nominated' for review manually, since the person asking is a logical assignee, but I have doubts about the general 'oldest open ticket' view.  If the process is 'find ticket, read, understand, ask if someone is going to work on this', it is not much less time than the current voting process.</p>\n<p>For reference, my thinking was a possible process of defaulting to the 'mover' being on the hook for resolution (don't move things you aren't willing to do!  =).  But I realized that generally people would just... not make motions.  In that scenario, it would be fewer steps and less time wasted to mark everything 'not interesting' and only take up issues that people move out of that state.</p>\n<p>After more reflection, I think an issue is that a lot of tickets do not meet the bar of 'interesting enough to <em>volunteer</em> doing' - similar to how it is easier to find volunteers to hand out refreshments than to pick up garbage.  Would that be something HL7 could fund (e.g., assign to 'someone getting paid to fix this type of thing because nobody else wants to')?</p>\n<p>I think there is also a related issue that people ( <span aria-label=\"raised hand\" class=\"emoji emoji-270b\" role=\"img\" title=\"raised hand\">:raised_hand:</span>  =) do not have the bandwidth to consistently troll the open ticket lists and try to sort/find tickets - work I would put under the Project Manager umbrella..

If it's not identified as a) a prioritization, and b) an expectation for certain people to do the job, then \"triaging on calls\" becomes the default.</p>\n<p>I <em>think</em> we have enough interested &amp; technically capable people on the FHIR-I calls that we could keep up - if we have the right processes in place.</p>\n<p>My proposal would be something like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have an agreement amongst the co-chairs to perform triage of FHIR-I items on a regular basis (every 2 weeks?  every 4 weeks?).  Triage would look for issues that can have resolutions pre-defined, make sure that change request vs. technical correction is properly set, distinguish tooling from non-tooling and prioritize based on broken/enhancement/normative-impacting/whatever and (if determinable), identify the amount of effort/skill type needed to apply the proposed change.</li>\n<li>Our review filter would ensure we only look at items that are triaged, based on priority.</li>\n<li>We review all issues, however before we can vote to approve something we would need the resolution completely clear in terms of the wording or resource change (no hand-wavy stuff) and have a volunteer to make the change.</li>\n<li>If we have agreement on appropriateness of a change, we can tag those issues as \"needs-volunteer\" and let them sit for a month or two.  If there are no takers in that period, we can resolve as not-persuasive</li>\n<li>We review the list of items that have been assigned and no updates in 4 weeks as part of our call to see if something needs to be re-assigned or re-opened and marked as \"needs-volunteer\".</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The biggest issue is making sure we continue to stay on top of things.  If we stay on top, triaging shouldn't take more than an hour a month and, amongst the 10 or so regular participants we have that know how to apply changes, probably not more than 1-2 hours outside calls per month to apply changes.  It's possible that there'll be the odd major change that involves a mass change of resources and/or significant tooling work that will take some time to get to, but at least then those will be known 'BIG' items that can be scheduled by the volunteer and that we can monitor to see if they're happening when scheduled or not.</p>\n<p>I'm certainly not suggesting that funding doesn't help.
