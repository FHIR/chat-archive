        "content": "<p>I'm trying to set up a way of having users describe valid \"clinical usecases\" - using local site systems and the data they contain. My working definition of clinical usecases is twofold:<br>\n- a protocol for treatment (research or standard healthcare)<br>\n- a protocol for an improved process/workflow at a given caregiver site<br>\nBoth can have goals defined as primary or secondary endpoints - the secondary ones being inputs for the next primary ones (general pattern for clinical research). <br>\nI could also have a protocol for a new treatment AND improved process goals   </p>\n<p>This is still early stage so I'm using a document template to describe systems and Processes of a given site as structured narratives and scenarios - hence the way systems process data is also a scenario (Data Granularity, Data Retrievability: just in time vs. hourly vs 1/day). Eventually I hope to come up with something more formal like a Zachmann framework or petri net and do some nlp to support linking the narratives to the formalism. That bit is still a long way up the road. <br>\nThe need is grounded in gruesome reality not theoretical aspirations: I just have the problem that my physicians are writing broken usecases which don't hold water after a first quick cross-check</p>",

And was positively surprised when <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191321\">@David Hay</span>  pointed this out to me. Especially the precondition / postcondition with structured references to the process steps. What is the intention of the new resource? I'm trying to understand the intent which led up to that model. Has anyone filled in a set of scenarios for a real usescase which they could share? I hear there is some tooling for this:  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191832\">@Jose Costa Teixeira</span>  ?</p>",

PlanDefinition lets you define protocols, activity templates, etc.  The purpose of ExampleScenario is to provide an example walkthrough that describes the specific instances created when a given protocol is executed.  While it can be used to explain a protocol, it's explaining by example (\"Dr. Jones admits patient Eva Everywoman on June 2, 2018, then orders the following lab tests: ...\") rather than by describing the specific rules, goals, etc.  The latter is the purpose of PlanDefinition.  ExampleScenario's primary purpose is for inclusion in implementation guides to help developers understand how the abstract behavior described in a specification would be realized in a 'real' scenario.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"191320\">@Lloyd McKenzie</span>  - You are right with PlanDefinition. I expressed myself a bit clumsily vis s vis plan vs. instance. Taking the inverse of your statement &gt;&gt;While it can be used to explain a protocol, it's explaining by example&lt;&lt;, I should be able to sensibly use ExampleScenario as a way towards a valid PlanDefinition. right? That's one aspect I'm pursuing - but that's the smallest problem.  The bigger challenge is this: Given I have a plan definition on one side - which I have to execute on 17 cancer care sites, I want to be sure that I can execute it in a valid way on those sites - within their different local systems and with their varying processes.  What I'm looking for is a way to formally describe the site/caregiving organization - their capabilities (systems &amp; processes). I have to translate the execution of that protocol in terms of the capabilities of that site. I have to validate the use case/protocol execution based on the capabilites (systems an processes) on that site. So I have the docs, documentalists, and some IT staff, name the systems and processes and write the plan definition in terms of a narrative relating to the local systems and processes. ExampleScenario seemed to be the \"Glue\" to help me get there more formally. It's obvious to me that domain specialists or algorithms have to do the formal linking-up to systms but PlanDefinition helps me get as close as possible.</p>",
