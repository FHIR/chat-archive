Thus far, we've migrated everything that was referenced somewhere in the FHIR spec and a few ad-hoc things when we went looking for them on Confluence and realized they weren't yet migrated.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"196484\">@Joshua Procious</span> has been more than happy to migrate any pages we directed him to.  However, the reality is that some of the content on the wiki is no longer useful/relevant and we don't really want to migrate <em>everything</em>.  The FHIR Management Group has been sitting on this for about a year, but no one's really had bandwidth to go through everything and propose what needs to come, what should be abandoned, and (perhaps more importantly), how we ought to organize the content on the new Confluence site.  (It's fair to say that the original wiki page was far from a master class in content organization, and the new Confluence page for the FHIR product family is arguably worse.)</p>\n<p>So - an appeal :)</p>\n<p>The FMG is looking for a person (or a group of two or three people) who might be willing to take a stab at proposing what content should be migrated, what content we should abandon and working to organize that content in a semi-usefully consumable manner on the Confluence site.  You can respond here or you can send me a PM if you're willing to help out.  (Proposals/ideas from those who don't want to help our but have ideas that might be useful are welcome too.)</p>",
