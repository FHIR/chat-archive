That discussion was part of working through the DEV agenda for the upcoming WGM, where we have a [joint session planned with OO Thursday Q1] (<a href=\"https://confluence.hl7.org/display/OO/OO+WGM+Agenda+-+202009\">https://confluence.hl7.org/display/OO/OO+WGM+Agenda+-+202009</a>) .  Your topic could probably be included in that discussion, or I believe the OO device product group has meetings frequently that you might be able to join.</p>",
