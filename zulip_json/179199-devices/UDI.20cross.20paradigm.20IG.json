What exact kind of validation purposes are addressed?<br>\nI registered to the ballot pool for this IG, so I'll probably post the same comment to the ballot. But it would be good to have an immediate answer. Thanks</p>",

Could we say, then, that the purpose is more of the kind of a safety net, or a debugging purpose, for instance when you configure a new barcode scanner or a new UDI parser and you want to validate the correctness of the process from end to end? I'll see if the statement evolved in the balloted IG. From my point of view, it should a little bit more that the key data is the UDI components.</p>",
