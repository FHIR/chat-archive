Meeting your needs in a typical FHIR REST environment can range from pretty easy for a reasonable number of patients with moderate monitoring needs, to pretty challenging to meet for large deployments (hundreds or thousands of beds with a lot of high-acuity patients and a lot of O.R. suites). What are you envisioning here?</p>",
