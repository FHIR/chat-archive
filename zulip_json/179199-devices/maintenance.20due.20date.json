For the documentation of the maintenance actually performed that may perhaps be an Observation profile to do so.  I'd not be inclined to use Task, other than to perhaps manage the performance of the maintenance.  I could see a counter argurment to create a Task with a future date to reflect upcoming maintenance that is then actually performed and yields an Observation against the Task/Device, but would like to then understand what the additional benefit is vs. doing so within the Device itself (e.g., if very frequent, perhaps).</p>",
