For example, if organization A contracts organization B for analytics work, can organization A offer a standards based analytics runtime environment for organization B to run model training and testing jobs that would not require transfer of data to organization B? Could the same capabilities be utilized at scale for real-time model execution?</p>\n<p>#4 Investigate use of techniques described in this article:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-018-0029-1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-018-0029-1\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-018-0029-1</a></p>",

We haven't yet written R bindings for Bunsen -- being focused on the Python/PySpark stack -- but this is definitely something we would like to do.</p>\n<p>2. It seems like the standards-based options are either invoking the FHIR resources needed by the model (possibly using CDS Hooks as an injection point), or something like a FHIR subscription to aggregate the changes. This leaves a lot of work on the model deployment to connect things together. How much of this pattern (if any) should be defined and directly supported by FHIR standards isn't obvious, but would be a great topic to explore.</p>\n<p>3. I think the \"SQL on FHIR\" discussion earlier on this thread could support that...by mapping all FHIR resources to analytic SQL operations, consumers could submit their analytic queries and receive the corresponding responses. (Plugging that into real-time model execution will be more involved depending on the latency requirements.)</p>\n<p>4. I know some of the authors of the original paper have been involved in Connectathons, but I'm not sure if they'll make it to this one, so I'll just defer to that group. :)</p>",

I can cover some of the pain points and questions we have about fitting into existing FHIR standards.  The potential for use of CDS Hooks for arbitrary (non EMR workflow initiated) execution is a particular area of interest.</p>",
