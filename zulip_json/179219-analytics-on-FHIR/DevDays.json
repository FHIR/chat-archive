(I was in another session this morning so missed some context so hopefully the following will make sense.)</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, I won't be highly involved in the Bunsen project any longer, but it is being maintained by folks at Cerner. Posting bugs to <a href=\"http://github.com/cerner/bunsen\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/cerner/bunsen\">http://github.com/cerner/bunsen</a> is probably the best place for discussions there. </p>\n<p>As for SQL schemas based on FHIR,  I think our best approach is to think of that as <em>views</em> over FHIR data that is easily used by SQL-based analytic tools. Trying to represent all of FHIR as a lossless SQL schema creates a lot of complexity that makes queries pretty difficult. That said, I think it is possible to have well-defined but lossy views of FHIR data expressed in SQL, as described at <a href=\"https://github.com/FHIR/sql-on-fhir/blob/master/sql-on-fhir.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/FHIR/sql-on-fhir/blob/master/sql-on-fhir.md\">https://github.com/FHIR/sql-on-fhir/blob/master/sql-on-fhir.md</a>. This topic didn't get as much attention in the last few months for unrelated reasons but I think can pick up steam again if there is general interest.</p>",
