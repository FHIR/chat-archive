We saw the GuidanCE REsponse resource and it seems to serve our purpose well. However, I am not sure if there exists a corresponding request resource inFHIR for 'GuidanceResponse'. Can somebody shed light on this. If there is no FHIR resource to handle the request then are we supposed to use the CDS Hooks Request and respond with Guidance Resposne resource. I would be grateful if you could provide some inputs. Thank you.</p>",
