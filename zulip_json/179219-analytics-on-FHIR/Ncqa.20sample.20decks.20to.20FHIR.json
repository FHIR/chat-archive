I get a Flat file out of my converter then split all the resources into individual Patient level Bundles, then run cql engine with the latest BCSE measure and compare with score file. I am able to match 100% of some criterias like CE, Num, RExclD RExcl. But I faced with some issues I can't resolve on my own. I am looking for meetig somebody with NCQA authority for help. <br>\nThanks!</p>",
