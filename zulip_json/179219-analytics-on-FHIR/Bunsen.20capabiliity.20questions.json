Are there any active Bunsen users or developers who would be willing to chat with me about what Bunsen is/is not capable of doing when processing FHIR data?</p>\n<p>I have some questions about working with Bundles of resources as well as resources that contain extensions. After looking at code and writing some simple examples, it seems like extensions are dropped completely when creating datasets. I was wondering if there are ways to work with extensions at all when using Bunsen.</p>\n<p>I am also wondering if there is a way to create a dataset of Bundles (if the types of resources in a Bundle are known ahead of time). My impression is that the pattern for working with Bundles is to extract individual resource types rather than working the Bundle as a whole in a dataset.</p>\n<p>I would appreciate any pointers or information that folks could offer. Thanks!</p>",
