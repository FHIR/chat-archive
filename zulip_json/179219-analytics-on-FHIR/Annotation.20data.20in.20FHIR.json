I have used ImagingManifest resource available in DSTU 3 for addressing DICOM datatype. I learnt that ImagingManifest has been removed in DSTU 4. I am trying to support annotation of JPG/TIFF/PNG images created as part of retinopathy studies or images created as part of digital pathology experiments. Also I would like to handle waveform, LIS, EMR data created as part of hospital workflow.</p>\n<p>Could you please help me understand/find a resource which can be used across data types and which is part of FHIR standard (similar to ImagingManifest available for DICOM). I am open for any of your suggestions in handling the data types to support annotation.</p>",
