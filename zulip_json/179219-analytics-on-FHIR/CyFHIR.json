With CyFHIR, users can: directly load FHIR Resources into their Neo4j database, execute Neo4j queries (using Neo4j’s query language, Cypher ) on those FHIR Resources, and return query responses as FHIR Resources that meet HL7’s standards.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn more checkout the the <a href=\"http://community.fhir.org/t/cyfhir-a-native-neo4j-plugin-for-handling-fhir-data/2107?u=matthew_frisby\">post</a> from yesterday or checkout our <a href=\"https://github.com/Optum/CyFHIR\">github</a>. We are still in pretty early stages but we've gotten quite a bit done for our 1.0 release coming this fall!</p>",

I would be interested if the approach scales acceptably</p>",
