For example, \"Patient\" would show the user pie charts of the distributions of gender, language, etc. Is there a way to query individual resources and see a comprehensive list of the SearchParameters available? I am trying to avoid hardcoding the default search parameters for a base resource (for Patient these would be things like name, address, gender), but querying <code>/SearchParameters?base=Patient</code> doesn't return these default params. thanks!</p>",
