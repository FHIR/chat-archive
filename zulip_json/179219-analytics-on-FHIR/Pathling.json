It's still a work in progress, but hopefully the documentation helps to articulate the ideas and direction.</p>\n<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p>",

I did not come up with the syntax, this already existed in the form of FHIRPath, which has been in use within the FHIR specification itself for quite some time.</p>\n<p>I have done a lot of analysis around GraphQL - it is technically possible to implement these operations using a GraphQL schema, but in my opinion the resulting solution would be quite messy and not really very usable. GraphQL is primarily concerned with selecting and shaping data, rather than transforming and aggregating it. It is possible to define functions and pass arguments, but there are other complications such as the polymorphic nature of elements and resource references in FHIR.</p>\n<p>If you would like to try it out with your own data, just send me a PM and I will find a way to give you access to the Docker image.</p>",
