It ensures that the European medicines regulatory network aligns with international standards, a key objective of the EU Telematics strategy.</p>\n<p>It enables EMA to progress in designing technical solutions and messaging formats for the SPOR programme, to realise technical efficiencies while respecting the content and processing requirements of the ISO IDMP standards.</p>\n<p>The European medicines regulatory network is currently discussing the requirements of the operating model for managing medicinal product data, which will determine the API's future use.</p>",
